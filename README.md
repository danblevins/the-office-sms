## About this Project

My friend and I always send each other quotes from The Office. I created this application to make it easier for me to grab funny quotes based on the character.

## Installation & Usage
Visit https://the-office-sms.surge.sh/ or text the name of an Office character (like "Dwight" or "Michael") to (206)-589-5333.
