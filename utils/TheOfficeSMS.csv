Michael, All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?,1,1,1
Michael," So you’ve come to the master for guidance? Is this what you’re saying, grasshopper?",1,1,1
Michael," All right. Well, let me show you how it’s done.  					",1,1,1
Michael," [on the phone] Yes, I’d like to speak to your office manager, please. Yes, hello. This is Michael Scott. I am the Regional Manager of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products. Just wanted to talk to you manager-a-manger. [quick cut scene] All right. Done deal. Thank you very much, sir. You’re a gentleman and a scholar. Oh, I’m sorry. OK. I’m sorry. My mistake. [hangs up] That was a woman I was talking to, so… She had a very low voice. Probably a smoker, so… [Clears throat] So that’s the way it’s done.  					",1,1,1
Michael," I’ve, uh, I’ve been at Dunder Mifflin for 12 years, the last four as Regional Manager. If you want to come through here… See we have the entire floor. So this is my kingdom, as far as the eye can see. This is our receptionist, Pam. Pam! Pam-Pam! Pam Beesly. Pam has been with us for…  forever. Right, Pam?",1,1,1
Michael," If you think she’s cute now, you should have seen her a couple of years ago. [growls]",1,1,1
Michael," Oh! Pam, this is from Corporate. How many times have I told you? There’s a special filing cabinet for things from corporate.",1,1,1
Michael, It’s called the wastepaper basket! Look at that! Look at that face.  					,1,1,1
Michael," People say I am the best boss. They go, “God we’ve never worked in a place like this before. You’re hilarious.” “And you get the best out of us.” [shows the camera his WORLD’S BEST BOSS mug] I think that pretty much sums it up. I found it at Spencer Gifts.  					",1,1,1
Michael," Corporate really doesn’t really interfere with me at all. Jan Levinson Gould. [walking out of his office] Jan, hello.  I call her Hillary Rodham Clinton. Right? Not to her face, because… well, not because I’m scared of her. Because I’m not. But, um… Yeah.  					",1,1,1
Michael, Really? I didn’t… [looks at Pam] Did we get a fax this morning?,1,1,1
Michael," Why isn’t it in my hand? A company runs on efficiency of communication, right? So what’s the problem, Pam? Why didn’t I get it?",1,1,1
Michael," Yeah, that was a joke. That was a joke that was actually my brother’s, and… It was supposed to be with bills and it doesn’t work great with faxes.",1,1,1
Michael," No, no, no, no, this is good. This is good. This is fine. Excellent.",1,1,1
Michael, All the alarm bells are kind of going… ringie-dingie-ding!,1,1,1
Michael," Me no wanna hear that, Jan. Because downsizing is a bitch. It is a real bitch. And I wouldn’t wish that on Josh’s men. I certainly wouldn’t wish it on my men. Or women, present company excluded. Sorry. Uh, is Josh concerned about downsizing himself? Not downsizing himself but is he concerned about downsizing?  					",1,1,1
Michael,"  Question. How long do we have to… [Telephone rings] Oh uh, Todd Packer, terrific rep. Do you mind if I take it?",1,1,1
Michael," Oh, my God! Oh! That’s… horrifying. Horrible. Horrible person.",1,1,1
Michael," No, absolutely. Under this regime, it will not leave this office. [zips his lips] Like that.  					",1,1,1
Michael," Am I going to tell them? No, I am not going to tell them. I don’t see the point of that. As a doctor, you would not tell a patient if they had cancer.  					",1,1,1
Michael," Howard, like Moe Howard. Three Stooges.",1,1,1
Michael," Watch this. This is Moe. Nyuck-nyuck-nyuck-nyuck-nyuck. Mee! [hold hand up for a high five] Ah, right here. Three Stooges. Oh, Pam. It’s a guy thing, Pam. I’m sort of a student of comedy. Watch this. Here we go. [Yelling in cod German] I’m Hitler. Adolf Hitler. [Continues with cod German]  					",1,1,1
Michael," Relax. Everything’s under control. Uh, yeah. Yeah. That’s important. Right. Oh this is so important, I should run to answer it. [Imitating Six-Million Dollar Man sound effect]",1,1,1
Michael," Come on. Six-Million Dollar Man! Steve Austin! Actually, that would be a good salary for me, don’t you think? Six million dollars? Memo to Jan. I deserve a raise.",1,1,1
Michael,"  If you’re unhappy with your compensation, maybe you should take it up with HR. OK. Not today, OK? Pam, just be professional. [Sighs]  					",1,1,1
Michael," I think I’m a role model here. I think I garner people’s respect. [Imitating a PA] Attention all Dunder Mifflin employees, please. We have a meeting in the conference room, ASAP.  					",1,1,1
Michael," People I respect, heroes of mine, would be Bob Hope… Abraham Lincoln, definitely. Bono. And probably God would be the fourth one. And I just think all those people really helped the world in so many ways that it’s really beyond words. It’s really incalculable.  					",1,1,1
Michael, Now I know there’s some rumors out there and I just kind of want to set the record straight.,1,1,1
Michael, I’m about to tell everybody. I’m just about to tell everybody.,1,1,1
Michael, Corporate has deemed it appropriate to enforce an ultimatum upon me. And Jan is thinking about downsizing either the Stamford branch or this branch.  					,1,1,1
Michael," It won’t be out of my hands Stanley, OK. I promise you that.",1,1,1
Michael,"  Well, yeah, it is a promise. And frankly, I’m a little insulted that you have to keep asking about it.",1,1,1
Michael," I know. Hold on a second. I think Pam wanted to say something. Pam, you had a look that you wanted to ask a question just then.",1,1,1
Michael," Well, Pam maybe you should stick to the ongoing confidentiality agreement of meetings.",1,1,1
Michael," No, Stanley. No, you did not see me in there with her. I said if Corporate wants to come in here and interfere, then they’re gonna have to go through me. Right? You can go mess with Josh’s people, but I’m the head of this family, and you ain’t gonna be messing with my chillin.  					",1,1,1
Michael," Watch out for this guy. Dwight Schrute in the building. This is Ryan, the new temp.",1,1,1
Michael," Assistant to the Regional Manager. So, uh, Dwight tell him about the kung fu and the car and everything.",1,1,1
Michael," OK. Hold on, hold on. The judge is in session. What is the problem here?",1,1,1
Michael," No, no, no. Do not take it out. You have to eat it out of there, because there are starving people in the world [turns to camera] which I hate, and it is a waste of that kind of food.",1,1,1
Michael," Discipline. Kinky! [Laughs] All right, here’s the deal you guys. The thing about a practical joke is you have to know when to start and as well as when to stop.",1,1,1
Michael,"  And yeah, Jim this is the time to stop putting Dwight’s personal effects into Jell-O.",1,1,1
Michael, [Laughing] Nice. That’s the way it is around here. It just kind of goes round and round.,1,1,1
Michael, Pudding. Pudding… I’m trying to think of another dessert to do.  					,1,1,1
Michael," So have you felt the vibe yet? We work hard, we play hard. Sometimes we play hard when we should be working hard. Right? I guess the atmosphere that I’ve created here is that I’m a friend first, and a boss second… and probably an entertainer third. [Knock at door] Just a second. Right? Oh, hey do you like The Jamie Kennedy Experiment? Punk’d and all that kind of stuff?",1,1,1
Michael," You are gonna be my accomplice. Just go along with it, OK?",1,1,1
Michael," Just follow my lead. Don’t pimp me, all right? Come in. So, uh, Corporate just said that I don’t want to…",1,1,1
Michael," Oh, thank you. Pam, can you come in here for a sec. Just have a seat. I was gonna call you in anyway. You know Ryan. As you know, there is going to be downsizing. And you have made my life so much easier in that I am going to have to let you go first.",1,1,1
Michael," 50 cents, yeah. If you steal a thousand Post-It Notes at 50 cents apiece, and you know,  you’ve made a profit… margin. You’re gonna run us out of business, Pam.",1,1,1
Michael, But the best thing about it is that we’re not going to have to give you any severance pay. Because that is gross misconduct and… Just clean out your desk. I’m sorry.,1,1,1
Michael," [Pam starts crying] You been X’d punk! [Laughing] Surprise! It’s a joke. We were joking around. See? OK. He was in on it. He was my accomplice. And it was kind of a morale booster thing. And we were showing the new guy around, giving him the feel of the place. So you… God, we totally got you.",1,1,1
Michael," What is the most important thing for a company? Is it the cash flow? Is it the inventory? Nuh-uh. It’s the people. The people. My proudest moment here was not when I increased profits by 17% or when I cut expenses without losing a single employee. No, no, no, no, no. It was a young Guatemalan guy. First job in the country, barely spoke English. He came to me, and said, “Mr. Scott, would you be the godfather of my child?” Wow. Wow. Didn’t work out in the end. We had to let him go. He sucked.  					",1,1,1
Michael, Gotcha. Good. I’d go with the rows. That’s a good idea.  				,1,2,2
Michael," Today is diversity day and someone’s going to come in and talk to us about diversity. It’s something that I’ve been pushing, that I’ve been wanting to push, for a long time and Corporate mandated it. And I never actually talked to Corporate about it. They kind of beat me to the punch, the bastards. But I was going to. And I think it’s very important that we have this. I’m very, very excited.  				",1,2,2
Michael, Did you have a good weekend going there?,1,2,2
Michael," Oh yeah, I bet it was fun. [to Mr. Brown] Oh, hey! This is Oscar—",1,2,2
Michael,"  Right. See? I don’t even know, first-name basis!",1,2,2
Michael," Oh hey, well, diversity, everybody, let’s do it. Oscar works in… here. Jim, could you wrap it up, please?",1,2,2
Michael," It’s diversity day, Jim. I wish every day was diversity day.",1,2,2
Michael," Come on people, let’s get ’em in. Get in the cards! Get in the cards!",1,2,2
Michael," You know what? This is a color-free-zone here. Stanley, I don’t look at you as another race.",1,2,2
Michael, Celebrate good times. Come on! Let’s celebrate diversity. Right?,1,2,2
Michael, You know what? Here’s what we’re going to do. Why don’t we go around and everybody… everybody say a race that you are attracted to sexually. I will go last. Go.,1,2,2
Michael," Hey, hey why don’t you run it by me and I’ll run it by him.",1,2,2
Michael," Ah. Oh, right! OK. First test. I will not call you that.",1,2,2
Michael," How come Chris Rock can do a routine and everybody finds it hilarious and ground-breaking and then I go and do the exact same routine, same comedic timing, and people file a complaint to Corporate? Is it because I’m white and Chris is black?  				",1,2,2
Michael, I will play the Chris Rock guy. I would like to see someone else pull this off.,1,2,2
Michael, Kevin is a great guy. He’s a great accountant. He is not much of an entertainer.  				,1,2,2
Michael," OK. I’m sorry. I’m sorry. He’s ruin… He’s butchering it. Could you just let me… [As Chris Rock] Every time… Every time black people want to have a good time, some ignant ass… [Bleep] I take care of my kid!",1,2,2
Michael, [Bleep] They always want credit for something they supPOSED to do!,1,2,2
Michael, [As Chris Rock] What you want a cookie?  				,1,2,2
Michael, [Clears throat] I don’t think I can sign this.,1,2,2
Michael," Well, OK, it says here that I learned something and I knew all this stuff already, so… I know, I could sign something that says that I taught something, or that I helped you teach something, so… Pam! Where is she? Pam, could we change something on this?",1,2,2
Michael," Here’s the thing. This office, I think this is very advanced in terms of… racial awareness and it’s probably more advanced than you’re used to. That’s probably throwing you off a little bit.",1,2,2
Michael," OK, well I know. You told me that several times.",1,2,2
Michael," Well, here I am thinking that you actually cared about diversity training. And you don’t.",1,2,2
Michael," “I regret my actions. I regret offending my coworkers. I pledge to bring my best spirit of honesty, empathy, respect and open-mindedness…” Open-mindedness, is that even a word? “…into the workplace. In this way, I can truly be a hero. Signed, Daffy Duck.” [Laughing] He’s going to lose it when he reads that.  				",1,2,2
Michael," “I pledge to always keep an open mind and an open heart.” I do believe… in that part of the pledge I that just read. But a pledge? Come on. I mean who are we, the Girl Scouts? No. Look… the guy, “Mr. Brown,” he got us halfway there. He got us talking. Well, no. I got us talking. He got us nothing. He insulted us and he abandoned us. You call that diversity training? I don’t. Were there any connections between any of us? Did anyone look each other in the eye? Was there any emotion going on? No. Where was the heart? I didn’t see any heart. Where was my Oprah moment? OK, get as much done as you can before lunch because, afterward, I’m going to have you all in tears.  				",1,2,2
Michael, All right? Everybody pretty? Come on. Here we go. It’s time. Let’s do some good.,1,2,2
Michael," No, this is not a joke. OK? That was offensive and lame. So double offensive. This is an environment of welcoming and you should just get the hell out of here. OK, let’s go. Let’s do it. Come on. Let’s have some fun, everybody. Here we go. Take a seat. Cop a squat. And um… thanks for coming in. Um… Diversity… is the cornerstone of progress as I’ve always said. But don’t take my word for it. Let’s take a look at the tape.  				",1,2,2
Michael," [on the tape] Hi. I’m Michael Scott. I’m in charge of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products here in Scranton, Pennsylvania but I’m also the founder of Diversity Tomorrow, because today is almost over. Abraham Lincoln once said that, “If you’re a racist, I will attack you with the North.” And those are the principles that I carry with me in the workplace.  				",1,2,2
Michael, Yes. I only had an hour to put it together but I’m going to add on to it later on.,1,2,2
Michael," Uh, yes. That probably had something to do with the camera work. Anybody else? Um…",1,2,2
Michael," Yeah, well, if you leave we’ll only have two left. Yes. Enjoy. Absolutely. Namaste. Ok, well since I am leading this, let’s get down to business and why don’t I just kind of introduce myself, OK? Um. I am Michael and I am part English, Irish, German and Scottish. Sort of a virtual United Nations. But what some of you might not know is that I am also part Native American Indian.",1,2,2
Michael," Well, you know what, it’s kind of hard for me to talk about it. Their suffering. So who else? Let’s get this popping. Come on. Who’s going? Who’s going? Let’s go here. Oscar, right here. You’re on.",1,2,2
Michael," Wow. That is… That is a great story. That’s the American Dream right there, right?",1,2,2
Michael," Um, let me ask you, is there a term besides Mexican that you prefer? Something less offensive?",1,2,2
Michael," …empathy, respect… [Phone ringing] Jim! Jim!",1,2,2
Michael," I have something here. I want you to take a card. Put it on your fore… Don’t look at the card. I want you to take the card and put it on your forehead and… Take a card, take a card, any card. Um… And I want you to treat other people like the race that is on their forehead. OK? So everybody has a different race. Nobody knows what their race is, so… I want you to really go for it, cause this is real. You know, this isn’t just an exercise. This is real life. And… I have a dream that you will really let the sparks fly. Get ‘er done.  				",1,2,2
Michael, Why? Because Martin Luther King is a hero of mine. There’s this great Chris Rock bit about how streets named after Martin Luther King tend to be more violent. I’m not going to do it but it’s…  				,1,2,2
Michael, Good. Bom bom bom-bom bom. Come on Olympics of Suffering right here. Slavery versus the Holocaust. Come on.,1,2,2
Michael," No, that was inadvertent. We didn’t actually plan that.",1,2,2
Michael," Pam, come on. “I like your food.” Come on stir the pot. Stir the melting pot, Pam! Let’s do it. Let’s get ugly. Let’s get real.",1,2,2
Michael," You’ll notice I didn’t have anybody be an Arab. I thought that would be too explosive. No pun intended. But I just though. “Too soon for Arabs.” Maybe next year. Um… You know, the ball’s in their court.  				",1,2,2
Michael, OK. All right. No. It’s good. You just need to push it. You need to go a little bit further. All right. OK.  				,1,2,2
Michael," [Voice raised, Indian accent] Kelly, how are you?",1,2,2
Michael," Oh! Welcome to my convenience store. Would you like some googi googi? I have some very delicious googi, googi, only 99 cents plus tax. Try my googi, googi. [Lowering voice] Try my googi, googi. [High-pitched voice] Try my googi, googi. Try my… [slap!]",1,2,2
Michael," [trying not to cry] All right! All right! Yes! That was great, she gets it! Now she knows what it’s like to be a minority.  				",1,2,2
Michael," I just hated it when that guy was in here. Mr. Brown, if that was his real name. I mean, he had never met any of us before, and here he was telling us how to do our thing. I just wanted… I just wanted to do it our way. You know? On our own. Man I should have gotten some food.",1,2,2
Michael," Okay, Kevin. You can take that off that thing, OK? That would really, really have shown him up, wouldn’t it? If I’d brought in some burritos or some colored greens. Or some pad Thai. I love pad Thai.",1,2,2
Michael," That doesn’t really make sense. Because you don’t call them collared people, that’s offensive. Hmmm… OK, well, it’s after five. So… Thank you very much. Buena vista Oscar. Thank you. Good job. Oh, my man. Thank you Brazil. Nice.  				",1,2,2
Michael," Let’s go. Messages. Stat. Lots to do, lots to do. Information superhighway.",1,3,3
Michael," The most sacred thing I do is care and provide for my workers, my family. I give them money. I give them food. Not directly, but through the money. I heal them. Today, I am in charge of picking a great new health care plan. Right? That’s what this is all about. Does that make me their doctor? Um… Yes, in a way. Yeah, like a specialist.  				",1,3,3
Michael," I am going to go with the best, Jan. I am going to go with the one with the acupuncture, therapeutic massage, you know, the works.",1,3,3
Michael, I think it was you who didn’t look closely enough at the Gold Plan.,1,3,3
Michael," Well, I’d recommend it. It’s very good.",1,3,3
Michael," Well, that is kind of a tough assignment. Um… It won’t be popular decision around the old orifice.",1,3,3
Michael," Well, it’s a suicide mission, you know.",1,3,3
Michael," There’s a decision that needs to be made, and I’m having an unbelievably a busy day. So I’m going to let you pick a health care plan for our office and then explain it to your co-workers.",1,3,3
Michael," Ah, none. You’re picking a health care plan.",1,3,3
Michael, You can use the conference room as a temporary workspace.,1,3,3
Michael," If Dwight fails, then that is strike two, and good for me for, ah, for giving him a second chance. And if he succeeds, then, you know, no one will be prouder than I am. I groomed him. I made him what he is today. Unless he fails, and we’ve talked about that already.  				",1,3,3
Michael," [on phone] Pam, Michael Scott. How’s tricks?",1,3,3
Michael," Oh, I am in my office. I am swamped. I have work up to my ears I’m busy, busy, busy. Can’t step away. I just wanted to check in and see how everybody’s doing. Everybody cool out there?",1,3,3
Michael," Pam! Whoa, whoa, I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I, I, I, I gotta go. I’m getting a call.",1,3,3
Michael," I have to make a call after I finish… my work. You know what? Uh, just don’t let anybody in my office under any conditions today. I’m just too busy. Too swamped, you know? I am unreachable. I am incommunicado, capisce?",1,3,3
Michael," Thank you, Oh, gah, here we go again. Gotta go, I have to take this.",1,3,3
Michael," Ah, uh, I would love to, but I am really busy. Rain check?",1,3,3
Michael," Cuts? What? Wow, Dwight, did you make cuts?",1,3,3
Michael," No, no , no, you know what? I said nothing specific because I was so busy. Why don’t you go in there and find these people a plan that will work for them? OK?",1,3,3
Michael," OK? All right. Do we feel good? All right. Good. Plus, there’s some other good news. Today, at the end of the day, I will have, for all of you, a big surprise. OK? So hang in there, and I will see you at the end of the day. Right?  				",1,3,3
Michael," Do I know what the surprise is? Hell no! It doesn’t matter. The point is, they’re not unhappy anymore. They’re out there thinking, “Wow, my boss really cares about me. He has a surprise. He’s cool. I… what a great guy. I love him. I… ",1,3,3
Michael, You know what? Come with me. We are going on a little mission. Operation Surprise.,1,3,3
Michael," Um, headed out. Part of my busy day, you know. Meetings. [Giggles] Couldn’t find the knob.  				",1,3,3
Michael," So, basically, I want to do something nice for my employees. Atlantic City, OK? They have this thing where they send a bus, right, for free. Picks everybody up, you head down there, get to the hotel, room is comped, they give you a pile of chips, and your food, everything just kind of all-inclusive, free kind of weekend.",1,3,3
Michael," [on his cell phone] Calling you to ask you a little favoroonie my friend. Um, trying to give the troops around here a little bit of a boost. And I was thinking that maybe we could take them down to take a spin on your big ride.",1,3,3
Michael," Uh, all right. Well, once you get down into the mine, what… you got laser tag or something?  				",1,3,3
Michael," OK, so I don’t know what the surprise is. Am I worried? No. No way. See, I thrive on this. This is my world. This is improv. This is Whose Line is it Anyway?   				",1,3,3
Michael," Hey, hey, everybody, Ice-cream sandwiches! Aaaahh! [laughs] Here you go. Take one, take one. It’s all good. Phyllis, think fast. Ya-bome! Oh, oh, I see Angela. Angela? Right? Waaaaah! Oh, hey temp. Why don’t you take two? Because you don’t get health care. And uh, faster metabolism.",1,3,3
Michael," Why don’t you just eat it, OK? And here you go, Stanley the manly.",1,3,3
Michael," Uh, nope. Nope. This isn’t the surprise. It’s surprising, um… because you didn’t expect it. But you will… you’ll know it when you see it.",1,3,3
Michael," Well, what? You could be referring to anything.",1,3,3
Michael," Oh come on! That’s horrible! Aaah… Thanks, Dwight, for a crappy plan. Ah, Damn! Oh, mmm, I wish I had time to change it, but Jan needs it by five, and… what time is it, what time is it? [looks at watch] Ah, it’s after five. Oh, oh it’s awful. So, well, OK. See you guys on Monday.",1,3,3
Michael," Oh… Yes. Exactly. Thank you Angela, for reminding me. Terrific. Um, before I tell everybody what the big surprise is, would you like to tell me what you think the big surprise is?",1,3,3
Michael," All right, I have some news for you. There is a big surprise. And… here it is. Here we go. And the big surprise is… Brrrrrrrr! Drum roll… Brrrrrrrr! Brrrrrrrr!  				",1,3,3
Michael," When I am backed into a corner, that is when I come alive. See I learned improve from the greats, like, um, Drew Carey and Ryan Stiles.  				",1,3,3
Michael," [clapping hands] God, yeah… Ah! This…  				",1,3,3
Michael," Robin Williams. Oh, man, would I love to go head-to-head with him. Oh! That would be exciting. [as Robin Williams] “Hi. I’m Mork from Ork.” Well, I’m Bork from Spork. Nanoo, nanoo. Jibelee, baloobaloo.  				",1,3,3
Michael, Assistant to the regional manager Dwight.,1,4,4
Michael," Look, look, look. I talked to corporate, about protecting the sales staff. And they said they couldn’t guarantee it if there’s downsizing, okay?",1,4,4
Michael," But there’s no downsizing, so just don’t…",1,4,4
Michael," It looks like there’s gonna be downsizing. And it’s part of my job, but… blah! I hate it. I think the main difference between me and Donald Trump is that, uh, I get no pleasure out of saying the words, “You’re fired.” [as Donald Trump] “You’re foir-ed. Uh, you’re foir-ed.” It just makes people sad, and an office can’t function that way. No way. [as Donald Trump] “You’re foir-ed.”  I think if I had a catchphrase it would be, “You’re hired, and you can work here as long as you want.” But that’s unrealistic, so…  				",1,4,4
Michael," Get set for Operation Morale Improvement starring Michael Scott. Now, I think I have had a little stroke of genius in that I have had my assistant Pam… Smile, Pam. I have had her go out and find out whose birthday is coming up, so we can have a little celebration for it. Not bad, not bad at all. All right. And the birthday person is… drum roll please. Here we go, who is the birthday, birthday person?",1,4,4
Michael," Um… uh, OK. Well, great, well, you know, it’ll be a surprise.",1,4,4
Michael," Yeah, why not? Sure. Go ahead, live a little. Come on, Pam. Come on, shake it up. Shake it up! Shake it up!",1,4,4
Michael," [grabs cell phone off desk] Brrrp! Uh, Spock, are there any signs of life down there? Well, let me check Captain. Eeee. Eeee. Eeee. Eeee. No, Captain. No signs of life down here. Just a wet blanket named Pam. Brr-rrrp. Star Trek.  				",1,4,4
Michael, These are my party-planning beeyatches. Pulled off an amazing ’80s party last year. Off the hook!,1,4,4
Michael," So I was thinking, if you haven’t already got a cake, um, maybe going for one of those ice-cream cakes from Baskin-Robbins. Those are very good. Very Delicious.",1,4,4
Michael," She’s not the only one that’s going to be eating it, right? I think everybody likes ice-cream cake. It’s not, uh, it’s not just about her, so…",1,4,4
Michael," Mint chocolate chip! That’d be good, how about some, mint chocolate chip?  				",1,4,4
Michael," [to the camera] Can you get her? She’s right there. [camera zooms in on Meredith at here desk] That is Meredith, the birthday girl. And this… is Meredith’s card. Happy Bird-Day. [laughs] Um, let’s see. Jim, Jim wrote, “Meredith, I heard you’re turning 46, but, come on, you’re an accountant. Just fudge the numbers.” Not bad, pretty funny, I don’t appreciate condoning corporate fraud though. Uh, here’s the thing. Whatever I write here has to be really, really funny. Because people out there are expecting it. I’ve already set the bar really high. And they’re all worried about their jobs, you know. It’s kinda dark out there. Can you imagine if I wrote something like, uh, “Oh, Meredith. Happy Birthday. You’re great. Love, Michael.” [pretends to vomit and laughs]  				",1,4,4
Michael," [staring at birthday card] Meredith, Meredith… Meri… Mary had a little lamb. Mary… Meredith had a little lamb. Don’t bring that lamb to work or it’ll poop on the floor.",1,4,4
Michael," Oh, not at all. Come on in. What’s going on?",1,4,4
Michael," Oh, God. Of course I would. Get it over here. Get that over here.",1,4,4
Michael," No, I’m always good… for some serious buckage. Wow. Two dollars, three dollars? People out here do not care about diseases. I am going to give you… $25.",1,4,4
Michael," Oh, my gosh, well… Listen, Oscar, generosity and togetherness and community all convalescences into… morale. That’s what I say, so…  				",1,4,4
Michael," [looking at birthday card] Meredith, bad breath. Meredith has bad breath.",1,4,4
Michael," There’s not going to be downsizing Dwight, OK? I just, I need to know a little bit more about my friend.",1,4,4
Michael," I know all that. I know all that. I just, I need something kind of embarrassing, you know. Kind of fun, inside.",1,4,4
Michael," Oh God! Dwight, no. I’m trying to write something funny. What am I going to do with a removed uterus?",1,4,4
Michael," You know what, I am on a deadline here, and just… OK. Thanks, thanks for your help. I’ll work it out. Thank you Dwight. That was a waste of time.  				",1,4,4
Michael," Almost there. Just a sec. Just a second. It is perfect, thank you. Excellent, here we go. It is time, thank you. OK, come on. Let’s go! Get the cake. Here we go. Come on! Shhh. Be quiet.  				",1,4,4
Michael," You looked freaked, man. We said “Surprise.” You were, like, “What?” “What the hell’s goin’ on here?” Good cake. Why don’t you have some?",1,4,4
Michael," You know what? If I were allergic to dairy, I think I’d kill myself. ‘Cause this is way, way too good.  				",1,4,4
Michael," Jim, good party, huh? Just a little something I whipped up. You know, a little morale boost. No big deal.",1,4,4
Michael," Well, you know, money isn’t everything Jim. It’s not the key to happiness. You know what is? Joy. You should remember that. Maybe you’ll give more than three dollars next time.",1,4,4
Michael," I just thought it was kind of a flat, you know… 25 dollar, one-time donation. I didn’t think it was per mile kinda deal. You know, so…",1,4,4
Michael," No, no, no, no, no. That wasn’t what I wasn’t, that wasn’t… No. It-it-it’s not about the money. It’s just… it… it’s the ethics of the thing, Oscar. How’s your nephew? Is he in good shape?",1,4,4
Michael, Son of a bitch. That is impressive.  				,1,4,4
Michael, Read it out loud. And say who wrote everything so we know whose is the best.,1,4,4
Michael, [under his breath] I don’t know about that.,1,4,4
Michael," [pretends to vomit] Huh! Thanks, downer.",1,4,4
Michael, Because of the downsizing. Rumors. And because you’re gettin’ old.,1,4,4
Michael," [laughs] You didn’t get the joke. So, that’s cool. That’s, you know what? Actually… I have a bunch of these, good ones, that I didn’t use. Um… Oh, where’s that? Oh, OK, here’s a good one. Um… “Hey Meredith, Liz Taylor called, she wants her age back and her divorces back.” ‘Cause Meredith’s been divorced like, twice. Is that right?",1,4,4
Michael, Everybody? If… could do it? “Meredith is so old…”,1,4,4
Michael," “She’s so old, she went into an antique store and they kept her.”",1,4,4
Michael," That wasn’t even mine. I got that off the Internet. Website. Um, don’t get mad at me.",1,4,4
Michael," This isn’t my fault. Ladies, not your best effort. The streamers?  I think we could have done better than that.",1,4,4
Michael," OK, we… all right. People, hold on, hold on. Just a second. OK, I think we’re losing sight of what is really important here. And that is that we are… a group of people… who work together. I was… I really wasn’t gonna flaunt this. I have made a very sizable donation to Oscar’s nephew’s… walkathon. $25.",1,4,4
Michael," When I retire, I… don’t want to just disappear to an island somewhere. I wanna be the guy who gives everything back.  				",1,4,4
Michael," A check for the kids, and for the team.   				",1,4,4
Michael," I want it to be like… “Hey, who donated that hospital wing that is saving so many lives?” “Um, well, I don’t, I don’t know. It was anonymous.” “Well, guess what, [whispering] that was Michael Scott.”  “But it was anonymous, how do you know?” “Because I’m him.”  				",1,4,4
Michael," Come here. [hugs Oscar and In a low voice] Don’t cash that till Friday, OK?  				",1,4,4
Michael," Today at lunchtime we’re going to be playing the warehouse staff at a friendly little game of basketball. My idea.  Last time I was down there, I noticed they’d put up a couple of hoops, and I play basketball every weekend. So I thought, “This might be kinda fun.”  And so I started messing around and… I’m sinking a few, you know. Swish, swish, swish. Nothing but net. And their jaws just dropped to the floor. African-Americans! So… you know, it’s really just a good friendly game, a reason to get together.  				",1,5,5
Michael," Pam, Pam, thank you ma’am. Messages, please. Thank you.",1,5,5
Michael," No. And that’s not me being mean, Dwight. That is based on your past behavior.",1,5,5
Michael, [to camera] When I let him come to my pick-up game…,1,5,5
Michael," I vouched for you in front of Todd Packer, Dwight.  All right, here’s what I’m going to do. The hand strikes and gives a flower. You are not going to play basketball. But I need somebody to come in and take over the holiday and weekend work calendar.",1,5,5
Michael," Good. Excellent, it’ll be fun. Because corporate, uh, wants someone to be here on Saturday. And so we’re going to have to have some people come in on the weekend, and I know nobody’s gonna want to do it and I know everybody’s gonna complain and bitch and I don’t want to have to deal with that.",1,5,5
Michael, Yes it is. Assistant to  the regional manager.,1,5,5
Michael," All right, managing by walking around. This is our warehouse. Or, as I like to call it, the whorehouse. But don’t you call it that, I’ve earned the right.",1,5,5
Michael," And here we have “Mister Roger’s Neighborhood.” Come on over here. Hey, this is Ryan. He’s temping upstairs.",1,5,5
Michael, And this is the foreman. Mista Ra-jahs.,1,5,5
Michael," No, it’s Darryl. Darryl is Mista Ra-jahs.",1,5,5
Michael," [laughs] And that is Lonny. And this is Roy. Roy dates Pam. You know, the uh, the best looking one upstairs.",1,5,5
Michael," You still getting it regular man? Huh? I mean, I can tell her it’s part of the job!  Rapport!  				",1,5,5
Michael," So, um, one o’clock sharp and we’ve got a game on.",1,5,5
Michael," Oh, I see, you’re chickening out on me. You’re bailing on me.",1,5,5
Michael," Oh, well, I’m glad that some time is a busy time because whenever I’m down here it doesn’t seem too busy to me. Oh, oh. You can dish it out, but you can’t take it. OK, fine, have it your way. [clucking and dancing like a chicken]",1,5,5
Michael," I… yeah, yeah. I know, grumble, grumble. But you would follow me to the ends of the earth, grumbling all the way. Like that, uh, dwarf from Lord of the Rings.",1,5,5
Michael, Nerd. That is why you’re not on the team.,1,5,5
Michael," Uh, [in a nerdy voice] “I’ll help, Elwyn Dragonslayer, uh, ten points, power sword.”",1,5,5
Michael," OK, so, let’s put together a starting line-up, shall we? Stanley of course.",1,5,5
Michael," Uh, I don’t know. I don’t remember saying that.",1,5,5
Michael," Well, people hear a lot of things, man. Um… other starters… Me, of course. I heard it that time.",1,5,5
Michael," [ignores Phyllis)] Um… Yeah. Who else? We have Jim. We have Ryan, the new guy, right? Untested. Willing to prove himself now. A lot of passion, a lot of heart.",1,5,5
Michael," Yes, this is business. The, uh, business of team building and morale boosting. Uh, who else?",1,5,5
Michael," I will use your talents come baseball season, my friend. Or if we box.",1,5,5
Michael," Close. All right, uh… Me, Stan the man, Jim, Ryan and Dwight.",1,5,5
Michael," No, I am the team manager. You can be assistant to the team manager.",1,5,5
Michael," Jim, you’re in charge of the vacation schedule now.",1,5,5
Michael, [hits Pam in the head with a piece of paper] Off the backboard!,1,5,5
Michael," Oh, Pam with a zinger. Hey, Pam, how would you, like to be our cheerleader today? You know, some, ah, pigtails? A little, ah, halter top, you could tie that up. And you know, something a little, just, youthful, for a change. Just this once?",1,5,5
Michael," Yeah, I bet you would. Just try not to be too gay on the court. And by gay I mean, um, you know, not in a homosexual way at all. I mean the uh, you know, like the bad-at-sports way. I think that goes without saying.",1,5,5
Michael," Oh, yuck, that’s worse than you playing. … ‘Cause we need you as an alternate in case somebody gets hurt. That’s where we need you. Blessed be those who sit and wait. You made it, suit up, you’re on the team! All right, cool! Very good.  				",1,5,5
Michael," Oh-oh. Oh-oh. A spy from the warehouse. Trying to figure out our plays, huh, man?",1,5,5
Michael," Oh ho, oh, he’s running. He’s running. He’s running, but he can’t hide because you know what? One o’clock, you better bring your ‘A’ game. Because me, and my, posse guys are gonna be in your face. Right in your face!",1,5,5
Michael," Whoa-ho. I like the way you think. You know what, I’m gonna take that one step further. Loser, works, on Saturday.",1,5,5
Michael," OK. Cool, you’re on. [to Dwight] Don’t screw this up.  				",1,5,5
Michael," [to camera] Classic beginner’s mistake, eating before a game.  				",1,5,5
Michael," Hey, there he is! Secret weapon! All right, guys, come on, let’s bring it in! Here we go!  OK, listen, this is just going to be a friendly game, right? We are all on the same team here, the Dunder Mifflin team. Of course, if you beat us, you’re fired. That’s a joke.  OK, let’s do it.",1,5,5
Michael," All right, everybody stretch out a little bit. Stretch it. Full stretch. Ryan, you wanna stretch?",1,5,5
Michael," Actually, I think Roy is their best player not Lonny. So, Dwight, you uh, have the East German gal. Uh, who else we got… Um…OK, all right, you guys.",1,5,5
Michael," Yes. Uh, Pam? You kind of have your foot in both camps, why don’t you do the uh, jump ball OK?",1,5,5
Michael," Stanley!  What? You gotta be kidding me! !?! [Roy steals the ball, and goes for a lay up] Oh… Here we go! [Lonny shoots and makes it] Who’s on him? Somebody get him!",1,5,5
Michael," Yeah, yeah, yeah. Over here, over here. [Jim saves the ball from going out of bounds and passes to Michael] Here we go. Three! [Shoots and misses] Let’s go to the zone! We’re going to zone!",1,5,5
Michael, Who’s got Roy? [Jim does a behind the back move around Roy for the basket],1,5,5
Michael," [misses a half court shot] Aw, come on! What is wrong with me today!? Usually hit those. [Dwight scores] Dwight, I was open. All right, let’s go.  				",1,5,5
Michael," [Roy bumps Michael to get around him] OK, foul. Charging. Charging. That’s a foul.",1,5,5
Michael," OK, I’ll take it. [misses free throw] OK.  				",1,5,5
Michael," When I am playing hoops all of the stress and responsibility of my job here just melts away. It’s gone, I’m in the zone.  				",1,5,5
Michael, [misses another shot] What is wrong with me today?!  				,1,5,5
Michael," Who am I? Am I Michael Scott? I don’t know… I might just be a basketball machine. What’s Dunder Mifflin? I’ve never heard of it. Filing? Paperwork? Who cares? Possible downsizing? Um… well, that’s probably gonna happen, actually.  				",1,5,5
Michael," Jim! Jim! Jim, right here, Jim! Give me the ball! Ryan, cut! [Michael looks away and misses Jim’s pass] Whoa!",1,5,5
Michael, That is cool. Is that like the Robot?  				,1,5,5
Michael, [Ryan scores] Nice! Come here! [gives Ryan a chest bump],1,5,5
Michael," Football is like rock and roll, it’s just bam-bam-boo… And basketball is like jazz, you know? You’re kind of… Dupee-doo, dupee-do. It’s all downbeat, it’s in the pocket, it’s like… [singing] Dupee-do, dupee-do, dapee-dah…  				",1,5,5
Michael," [singing] Du-du-du-du-dupee-do, de-do-do-do. Du-du-du-du-dupee-do, de-do-do-do. Harlem Globetrotter…",1,5,5
Michael," All right, time, time out. Come on, sales, over here. Bring it in! Come on!",1,5,5
Michael, What’s going on? What’s going on? You’re playing like a bunch of girls.,1,5,5
Michael," All right, switch. Take it up a notch, come on.  				",1,5,5
Michael," Shoot, shoot it.  [Roy hits Jim in the mouth with his elbow] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Foul! Naked aggression!  Oh, that is… You all right Jim? Suck it up.  				",1,5,5
Michael," [Jim makes a shot after pushing off Roy] Ouch! Oh, how much does it hurt? How much does it hurt?  				",1,5,5
Michael, [Jim pushes Roy to the ground and makes another shot] Yes!,1,5,5
Michael," [Darryl scores] Watch the long passes, you guys!  				",1,5,5
Michael," [Phyllis scores] Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! In, your, face! Angela, what’s the score?",1,5,5
Michael, [Jim has the ball] Jim! Jim! Right here! [runs into the elbow of the guy guarding him] Ow! God! Hold it!,1,5,5
Michael," What’s your problem man? Gah, just clocking me for no reason?",1,5,5
Michael," No, no, no, no. That was a flagrant, personal, intentional foul. Right there.",1,5,5
Michael," [mocking voice] Yes, it was. You know what, I’m just being fair.",1,5,5
Michael," Game over. Game over. That is it! I’m sorry, you know? I hate to do it this way but, you know, that’s just… we’re having a friendly game. It’s a shame. This is a damn shame, but we’re like a family here and that just, that won’t fly.",1,5,5
Michael," Well, let’s just say whoever was ahead won.",1,5,5
Michael," It was us? Really? I didn’t, I didn’t know. Great, I mean, I guess you guys are working Saturday. Your face.",1,5,5
Michael," Um… well, you guys, you know, I’m the boss so…",1,5,5
Michael," [laughing] You guys believed me? Come on. Dogs, you know, you should know me better than that. No, oh, do you think that would’ve been good for morale? No. No. No. Exactly, no. I’m embarrassed it was even that close though. So… nah, of course, we’re coming in Saturday. Good game. Word.  				",1,5,5
Michael," Come on. Let’s not be gloomy here man. We’re all in this together. We’re a team. You know what? Screw corporate, nobody’s coming in tomorrow. You have the day off. Like coming in an extra day is gonna prevent us from being downsized. Have a good weekend.  				",1,5,5
Michael, The great thing about sports is that it is all about character. And you can learn lessons about life even if you don’t win. But we did because we were ahead.  				,1,5,5
Michael," You just said, let me uh… check my notes.  You just said… ",1,6,6
Michael," Hey, hey how is Alan?  Tell Alan that the Mets suck! Okay? From me, big time. Go Pirates! ",1,6,6
Michael," Whoa. Howdy-ho. Wow, a thousand big ones. That’s cool. Do I uh, do I get to pick the prize? ",1,6,6
Michael," Um, question: Does top salesman include uh, people who were at one time such outstanding salesman that’ve been promoted to…",1,6,6
Michael," Well, first what we have to do is find out what motivates people more than anything else. ",1,6,6
Michael, It’s illegal. Can’t do that.  Next best thing. ,1,6,6
Michael," Tah, come on Dwight. Just help me out here. That’s just stupid. ",1,6,6
Michael," No, no, no. No vendors in the office. That is a distraction. ",1,6,6
Michael," Pam. Pam. Come on, I’m busy. So just tell her to go away. ",1,6,6
Michael," [exhales loudly, looks out window and sees Katy] Oooh, alright I’ll talk to her.   				",1,6,6
Michael," All right girls break it up, you’re being infiltrated. Cock in the henhouse. ",1,6,6
Michael," Don’t say cocks. Oh, what is your name, my fair lass? ",1,6,6
Michael," Ah, Katy. Wow. Look at you. You are, uh you’re like the new and improved Pam. Pam 6.0. ",1,6,6
Michael," Oh, look. Oh hey, no catfights you two. I’m  against violence in the workplace. ",1,6,6
Michael," So uh, you know what? I usually don’t allow solicitors in the office but today I am going to break some rules, and you can have the conference room. It’s yours. All day. ",1,6,6
Michael," Well, lets put ’em in the hallway. Give ’em some chairs. Right? Decisiveness. One of the keys to success according to Small Businessman.   				",1,6,6
Michael," I do. I read Small Business man. I also uh, subscribe to USA Today and American Way Magazine, that’s the in-flight magazine. Some great articles in that. They did this great profile last month of Doris Roberts and where she likes to eat when she’s in Phoenix. Illuminating.   				",1,6,6
Michael," This is my conference room. So please, uh, make yourself at home. Whatever you need, I’m right on the other side of this wall. [knocks on wall]  used to be a window here. There’s not anymore. So, that’s where I will be. ",1,6,6
Michael," So if you need anything else, something to make you more confortable just don’t hesitate to ask. I’m right here. ",1,6,6
Michael," Wait a second. I should have spotted another addict. Uh, gotta love the ‘bucks. ",1,6,6
Michael," It’s like a slang for Starbucks. They’re all over the place. Oh, man, that place is like the promised land to me. What a business model too. Ah, too bad we don’t have the good stuff here. ",1,6,6
Michael," No, here’s the thing. Y’know I do my best to be my own man and go by the beat of a different drummer and nobody gets me, and they’re always putting up walls and I’m always tearing ’em down, just breakin’ down barriers, that’s what I do all day.  So a coffee, regular coffee for you. High test, or unleaded?   ",1,6,6
Michael," Oh. Woo, I will. I will bring it on. Ah, all right.    				",1,6,6
Michael, [handing Katy a mug of coffee] There ya go. Nice steaming cup o’joe. ,1,6,6
Michael," I have an idea.  Why don’t I introduce you around, you know you can kind of get your foot in the door, meet potential clientele, right? ",1,6,6
Michael," Oh, um, well, we could have Ryan take a look. Ryan, would you look after the purses, please? ",1,6,6
Michael," Yeah, well, bladdy-bluda-blah-blah. Techno-babble. Just do it, okay. We have company. Right?   				",1,6,6
Michael," You should sell a lot here because this branch made over a million dollars last year. Not that we’re all millionaires. I’m probably closest. So here’s Oscar. Oscar, this is Katy. ",1,6,6
Michael, Oooh-ooh. Oscar the grouch. Right? I thought of that. ,1,6,6
Michael, I know. I know. I made the connection. Can you believe he’d never heard that before he worked here? ,1,6,6
Michael," Here is Toby from Human Resources. Katy, Toby. ",1,6,6
Michael," Toby’s divorced. He uh, guh recently, right? ",1,6,6
Michael, Oh that so – that was really messy. He slept one night in your car too? ,1,6,6
Michael," Okay. Alright. Cool.  See ya in a bit. [looks at picture on Toby’s desk] Oh, she’s cute.  Cutie-pie. Back to work.    				",1,6,6
Michael," I live by one rule. No office romances. No way. Very messy. Inappropriate. No. But, I live by another rule: Just do it. Nike.    				",1,6,6
Michael," Giggle-giggle, juji-juji, I get it, I get it. Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood over here right?  [to Katy] So how’s that uh, coffee from earlier?",1,6,6
Michael," Ah, I knew it. Guzzled it down. You greedy little thing.  So, uh, Pam is this your lunch break, or was that earlier when you were eating in the kitchen with those guys? ",1,6,6
Michael," Oh hey, I want to show you something. Come here I want to show you something.  I know you are going to like this. Picked it up today. A thousand big ones. ",1,6,6
Michael, Yes. This is a Starbucks digital barista. This is the mack daddy of espresso makers. ,1,6,6
Michael," Oh, I know what you’re thinking. You’re not prying this out of my hands, but don’t tempt me because I’ll give it to you!",1,6,6
Michael," Coffee is the great incentivizer in the office. It’s a drug. It is quite literally a drug that speeds people up. It’s not the only drug that speeds people up. You hear stories about Dunder Mifflin in the eighties before everybody knew how bad cocaine was. Guh. Man, did they move paper!   				",1,6,6
Michael," [Katy reading text message on her phone] Oh the rotating um, steam wand. [Katy looks annoyed] What? What’s the matter? ",1,6,6
Michael, Where you going? Nearby? Because I can give you a ride.,1,6,6
Michael," God! No, no, no, no. No inconvenience. I mean I’m out of here at five sharp. ",1,6,6
Michael," I can go earlier. ‘Cause I’m the boss. You know, whatever. I’m out of here slaves. ",1,6,6
Michael, Okay. Sounds good. Sounds good.  Five o’clock sharp.  I will give you and your purses a ride home. ,1,6,6
Michael," Great. Cool. Cool. [takes deep breath – looks at camera] Yeah, okay.   				",1,6,6
Michael, I should have never let the Temp touch this thing. I had all these great icons and now I have four folders. So..,1,6,6
Michael, No it’s not. Because I could just click on the icon and then I’m onto— ,1,6,6
Michael," No, no, no it’s not against the rules.  She’s not a permanent employee so it’s not. ",1,6,6
Michael, But I think you should just know that I am going to be giving her a ride home later. ,1,6,6
Michael, She asked me for a ride and so I am going to give her a ride home. ,1,6,6
Michael," Well, might be a ride home.  Might be a ride home and we stop for coffee and dot-dot-dot…",1,6,6
Michael," [laughs] Dwight, no. I don’t know. It’s too early to tell. I don’t know how I feel. [Dwight sadly looks away]  				",1,6,6
Michael, You’re welcome. Thank you.  Hmmm-hmm-hmm.,1,6,6
Michael," Okay. Like he’s going to win anyway, right? [laughs]  				",1,6,6
Michael," Yes you did. Yes, you did. Just checkin’. Just checkin’, double checkin’, checkin’ on the check. Thoroughness is very important in an office and…",1,6,6
Michael," Yeah, yeah, of course. Uh, Pam, one more thing. Um, how do girls your age feel about futons?  				",1,6,6
Michael, Would you like to help me with a special project? ,1,6,6
Michael," [in Michael’s car] Okay, just throw out all the empties.",1,6,6
Michael," Um, yes. Throw them away in the recycling bin. ",1,6,6
Michael," Oh, Blue Blast. Yes, put that in the trunk, and there should be an unopened Arctic Chill back there. I want that in the passengers cupholder. Thank you.   				",1,6,6
Michael," What, stop! Whoa! That’s my Drakkar Noir. ",1,6,6
Michael," No, it is a perfect smell-alike. I’m not paying for the label. Right here. Give it. ",1,6,6
Michael," Not it’s not, there’s some in the straw. [Michael opens bottle and wipes straw along his neck] There, now you may throw it out. ",1,6,6
Michael," I think in order to be a ladies man, it’s imperative that people don’t know you’re a ladies man, so I kind of play that close to the chest. I don’t know, what can I say? Women are attracted to power. And I think other people have told me that I have a very symmetrical face. [laughs] I don’t know. I don’t know. Maybe they’re right?  I don’t know.   				",1,6,6
Michael, Sure you don’t want me to help you with that?  Cause I can grab that no problem.,1,6,6
Michael," See you later. Goodnight. Goodnight, Jim. ",1,6,6
Michael," Okay. Great. Off the hook. Excellent. Okay, cool.",1,6,6
Michael," Do I have a special someone?  Uh well, yeah of course. A bunch of ’em. My employees. If I had to choose between a one-night-stand with some stupid cow I pick-up in a bar, and these people? I’d pick them every time.  Because with them, it is an everyday stand and I still know their names in the morning.   				",1,6,6
Michael, [in a Fat Albert voice] Hey hey hey! It’s Fat Halpert.,2,1,8
Michael, [in Fat Albert voice] Fat Halpert. [in normal voice] Jim Halpert.  					,2,1,8
Michael," So why don’t I take you on a tour of past Dundie winners. We got Fat Jim Halpert here. Jim, why don’t you show of your Dundies to the camera?",2,1,8
Michael, Gyaaah. T.M.I. T.M.I my friends.   					,2,1,8
Michael," T.M.I.? Too much information. Ah, it’s just easier to say T.M.I. I used to say “Don’t go there” but that’s… lame.  					",2,1,8
Michael," And here we have Stanley the Manly. Now Stanley is a Dundie all-star, aren’t you Stan? Why don’t you, ah, show them some of your bling.",2,1,8
Michael," Yes we should. I… you know what?  I wanted one of those skillets of cheese, but when I got off stage, [turns to Kevin] someone had eaten all of them.  					",2,1,8
Michael, [in video] To Oscar Martinez it’s the “Show Me the Money” award! Yeah!  					,2,1,8
Michael," [in video] He has the award-ah! …it’s a type of song that we are going to play for the ladies. Hit it, Dwight!",2,1,8
Michael," [singing along to tune on video] A little bit of Paaam, all night long, a little bit of Angela on the thing…",2,1,8
Michael, [in video]…a little bit of Phyllis everywhere…,2,1,8
Michael," [on video] …a little bit of Roooy eating chicken crispers… …a little bit of Jim with some ribs, a little bit of…  					",2,1,8
Michael," [talking to the speakerphone] Will her highness, Jan Levinson-Gould, be descending from her corporate throne this evening to visit us lowly serfs here at Dunder Mifflin Scranton?",2,1,8
Michael," Well, you could take the bus.  You could work on the way here. Sleep on the way home.",2,1,8
Michael," Wuh… Come on, Jan. This is important. I mean, this is, this is, validation to my employees here that you and corporate approve of this. So…",2,1,8
Michael," Yeah, I’m here, I just wanted to, uh, talk to you for a second about that.",2,1,8
Michael," Okay, no, that was a FUN raiser. I think I made that very clear in the fliers, fun, F-U-N.",2,1,8
Michael," Well, I think a lot of people were very affected by the footage.  					",2,1,8
Michael," This is a little character I like to do [places a green turban with a yellow feather on his head], it is, uh, loosely based on Karnack, one of Carson’s classic characters. [puts an envelope to his head] Here we go. The PLO, the IRA, and the hot dog stand behind the warehouse. [tears open envelope and pulls out card] “Name three businesses that have a better health care plans than Dunder Mifflin.”  Here’s the problem. There’s no open bar because of Jan and it’s the reason why comedy clubs have a two drink minimum. It’ll be fine, I just…wish people were going to be drunk.  					",2,1,8
Michael, [in video] The Dundie award for “Longest Engagement” goes to Pam Beesley.,2,1,8
Michael," Whoooo! When is that girl gonna get married? That’s what I have to say. Ah, Roy’s accepting.",2,1,8
Michael," [on video] Thank you Roy. Are there any words you’d like to say, on Pam’s behalf?",2,1,8
Michael," [on video] Yeah, oh, hope not! Oh God!  					",2,1,8
Michael," I’m not changing that, it’s the best one.",2,1,8
Michael," That’s why it’s funny. Every year that Roy and Pam don’t get married, it gets funnier.",2,1,8
Michael," Oh, [taking it to heart] lazy. Uh huh.  					",2,1,8
Michael," Okay, well, that’s just ridiculous, so just don’t, I-I don’t have time for this right now.",2,1,8
Michael," Okay, look, I know there have been a lot of rumors flying around about the Dundies this year. How there is no money, and how there is no food, and how the jokes are really bad, but WHAT THE HELL EVERYBODY!? I mean, God. The Dundies are about the best, in every, one of us. Can’t you see that? I mean, okay, we can do better. so, tonight, for the first time, we are inviting all of your friends and family to attend the awards with us.",2,1,8
Michael," Yeah, not bad, right? So let’s make this the best Dundies ever.",2,1,8
Michael," “The Dundies, how can I explain it? Awards you like to hate it. I’m psyched you all made it. You never had to work so hard and feel that no one notices you.  You’re just a name and number and no one even says hello.” [to Ryan] Card!  					",2,1,8
Michael, “You down with The Dundies? You down with the Dundie-“,2,1,8
Michael," Alright, alright, joke landed. So we are here, thank you all for coming to the 2005 Dundie awards. [takes off sweater to reveal tuxedo] I am your host, Michael Scott. And I just want to tell you please, please, do not drink and drive. Because you may hit a bump and spill the drink!  					",2,1,8
Michael," Nope, actually this year, ah, no group tab, we’re going to be doing separate checks.",2,1,8
Michael," Well, I’m looking forward to meeting Terri.",2,1,8
Michael," [to Dwight, in a low voice] Shut it. [normal voice] Um, good. Speaking of relationships, of all, all way shapes and forms. Um, I was out on a very, very hot date with a girl from HR, Dwight.",2,1,8
Michael," No, that…for the sake of the story. And things were getting hot and heavy.",2,1,8
Michael, …when she made me fill out six hours of paperwork-,2,1,8
Michael," [clears throat] Alright, so let’s get this party staaaarrrrted.  					",2,1,8
Michael," Um, guys, where you going? Pam, show’s just getting started.",2,1,8
Michael," And now… to someone who quietly goes about their job, but always seems to land the biggest accounts…",2,1,8
Michael, …the “Busiest Beaver” award goes to Phyllis Lapin.,2,1,8
Michael," Yeah, way to go Phyllis. Nice work, per usual.",2,1,8
Michael," Well, we’ll fix it up. You don’t have to display that.  					",2,1,8
Michael, [in a stereotypical oriental accent] Herro everybodeeee. I’m gonna cwall Jan Revinson-Gould.  					,2,1,8
Michael," [doing impression] Oh, dat wir be fwar. Ah, me so horny.",2,1,8
Michael, Right? You know wat I’m talking ’bout.  					,2,1,8
Michael," This next award goes to somebody, who really, lights up the office.",2,1,8
Michael," Somebody, who I think a lot of us, cannot keep, from checking out. The “Hottest in the Office” award goes to… …Ryan the temp!",2,1,8
Michael," Yeah. [singing to music] “Hidy ho, you sexy thang. You sexy thang you.” Here you go.  					",2,1,8
Michael," And the “Tight Ass” award goes to Angela.  Not only because she is everybody’s favorite stickler, but because she has, a great caboose.  So…come on down.",2,1,8
Michael, The “Spicy Curry” award goes to our very own Kelly Kapoor!  Get on up here. Here you go.,2,1,8
Michael," Um, not everything means something, it’s just a joke.",2,1,8
Michael, I know. It’s ju- they didn’t have any more businessmen. So…,2,1,8
Michael," [sweaty and chugging water from a bottle] It’s so freakin’ hot in there. Now I know what Bob Hope was going through when he performed in Saudi Arabia. Man! I got Dwight sucking the funny out of the room, but you do what you can do. [Music starts playing in the background] Here we go, he’s early with the cue. Here we go.  					",2,1,8
Michael, [Michael is singing to the tune of “Tiny Dancer” by Elton John] “You have won a tiny Dundie.”,2,1,8
Michael," Hey, thanks guys. Hey, where you guys from?",2,1,8
Michael," Uh, you know what guys, we’re just having a little office party, so if you want, uh…",2,1,8
Michael," [Something flies by Michael] Hey, you know, cool it guys, really-",2,1,8
Michael, Let’s cut it. [Dwight turns the music off],2,1,8
Michael," [clears throat] [with a lot less enthusiasm] I had a few more Dundies to, uh, give out tonight, but, I’m just going to cut it short. And wrap it up so everybody can enjoy their food. Um…thanks for listening, those who listened. [clears throat] This last Dundie is for Kevin, this is the “Don’t Go in There After Me” award. It’s for the time that I went into the bathroom after him, and it was really, really smelly. So…",2,1,8
Michael, [give Kevin his award]There you go.  					,2,1,8
Michael," [getting his spirit back] Alright, alright, alright, okay. Alright, we’ll keep rolling. Okay, this is the fine work award. This goes to Stanley, for all the fine work he did this year.",2,1,8
Michael, And this next award is going out to our own little Pam Beesley…,2,1,8
Michael, …I think we all know what award Pam is going to be getting this year.,2,1,8
Michael, It is the “Whitest Sneakers” award! Because she always has the whitest tennis shoes on!  					,2,1,8
Michael," Get on down here! Pam Beesley ladies and gentlemen! [Pam grabs the microphone from him] Oh, here we go.",2,1,8
Michael, Pam Beesley ladies and gentleman. [Pam hugs Michael and gives him a quick peck on the cheek] Oh! Thank you.  					,2,1,8
Michael," Was this year’s Dundies a success? Well, let’s see, I made Pam laugh so hard, that she fell out of her chair, and she almost broke her neck. So I killed, almost.   					",2,1,8
Michael," Yes, that too, but I mean with the audio. Great work.  					",2,1,8
Michael," I am king of forwards. It’s how I like to do business, everybody joking around. We’re like ‘Friends’. I am Chandler and Joey and, uh, Pam is Rachel. And Dwight is Kramer.  				",2,2,9
Michael, That’s funny! That’s funny. Not offensive. Uh… because it’s nature. Educational. ,2,2,9
Michael," Yeah… maybe. Maybe. Well, we’ll see. Because I… I don’t know if it’s… [muffled by jacket over his head] Whup! Come on! Hey!",2,2,9
Michael," Oh, Boom! Bam! Oh, this guy is out of control! He is a madman! Better get the bleep button ready for him.",2,2,9
Michael," Todd Packer and I are total BFF. Best Friends Forever. He and I came up together as salesmen. One time, we were out and we met this set of twins. And Packer told them that we were brothers. And so, you know, one thing led to another, and we brought em back to the motel. And then Packer did both of them. It was awesome. So…   				",2,2,9
Michael," Oh-whoa-oh! Oh! Okay. Grade ‘A’ gossip for you, right now. Randall, CFO, resigned. Nobody knows why.",2,2,9
Michael, Really? Here we go! Buckle up. It’s going to be a bumpy one!,2,2,9
Michael," Well, to be fair… blondes, brunettes, you know, there’s a lot of dumb people out there.",2,2,9
Michael, Oh! Wow! I didn’t say it! I didn’t say it!,2,2,9
Michael," Oh, wow! What did I tell you about the bleep button.  				",2,2,9
Michael, Oh. Bad boy. [to Ryan] Um… Ryan? [makes Donald Duck noise],2,2,9
Michael, Ah! Man. That Todd Packer can do anything.,2,2,9
Michael," Hey, send me that link to the monkey sex video. I’m going to forward it like it’s hot.",2,2,9
Michael, Forward it like it’s hot. Forward it like it’s hot. “Old School”.,2,2,9
Michael, Toby is in HR which technically means he works for Corporate. So he’s really not a part of our family. Also he’s divorced so he’s really not a part of his family.  				,2,2,9
Michael," It is a big deal. It’s a big deal! What are we supposed to do? Scrutinize every little thing we say and do all day? I mean, come on!",2,2,9
Michael," What? He! No! Okay, what is a lawyer going to come in and tell us? To not send out hilarious emails or not tell jokes? ",2,2,9
Michael, There is no such thing as an appropriate joke. That’s why it’s a joke.  				,2,2,9
Michael," Everyone! Hello! Everyone. Hi! Sorry to interrupt. I know you’re all busy and the last thing you want is for a major interruption. But Toby has an announcement that he insists on making right now in the middle of the day. [to Toby] So, take it away.",2,2,9
Michael," I wish you luck, Toby. I really do. But you are going to have a mutiny on your hands and I just can’t wait to see how you handle it.  				",2,2,9
Michael," A guy goes to a five dollar… lady of the night and he gets crabs. So, the next day he goes back to complain. And the woman says “Hey. It was only five dollars. What did you expect? Lobster?” This is what’s at stake.  				",2,2,9
Michael," Time to bring out the big guns. I’m heading down to the warehouse where jokes are born. Find a killer joke that’ll just blow everybody away at the seminar later. And remind them what is great about this place. So… ah! Here they are. [to Warehouse guys] Guys! Wondering if I could, uh, get your help for something. I’m looking for a new joke to tell and it needs to be just killer. And it does not need to be clean. So whatcha got?",2,2,9
Michael," Um, yeah, no, well… I mean better. Better than that. The type of stuff you guys tell all day. ",2,2,9
Michael," Alright, alright. Well, yeah, but, you know… a joke but not necessarily at my expense.",2,2,9
Michael," Well, not exactly what I was looking for but thanks guys.",2,2,9
Michael," I know, I know. It’s good. It is not over. It is not over til it’s over.",2,2,9
Michael," Did he tell you everything? Obviously, he didn’t because you all still look relatively happy. Albeit bored. Do you realize what we’re losing? Seriously?",2,2,9
Michael, Exactly! Mmwwah [blows kiss to Angela]! Can we afford to lose email forwards? Do we want that?,2,2,9
Michael," Give me a break. Umm… Stanley, how about that hot picture you have by your desk? Centerfold in the Catholic schoolgirl’s outfit? I mean, it is hot, it is sexy, and it turns him on. And I will admit, best part of my morning is staring at it. But what? Are we just going to take it away?",2,2,9
Michael," I think the old honor system was just fine. For example, I have never slept with an employee. And, believe me, I could have.",2,2,9
Michael, No! No! Catherine. Remember her? Remember how hot she was? ,2,2,9
Michael, She would have definitely slept with me.,2,2,9
Michael, What if Pam was a lesbian? What if she brought her “partner” in to work? [to Toby] Would that be crossing the line? ,2,2,9
Michael, What if they made out? In front of everybody?,2,2,9
Michael, At home? And I told everybody everything about it.,2,2,9
Michael," Okay. Well, then let’s act it out. Pam, you will be girl A and girl B will be… Okay! We’ll use the doll. Pam. Pam?   				",2,2,9
Michael," I wish Todd Packer was here because he would love this. I wonder if anybody else would like to do this. Hey! Um… we have to watch, uh, Toby’s video that he’s showing us in order to brainwash us and I was wondering if anybody would like to join in? Going to be fun. Got my great pizza. Whataya say? Jim?",2,2,9
Michael," That’s what she sai [clears throat]  Nope, but… Okay. Well, suit yourself.  				",2,2,9
Michael," Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa… Okay! Hypocrite! She is a hypocrite. That is such a scam! Okay.  				",2,2,9
Michael," Okay, you are never going to believe this. The girl in the video we’re watching that Corporate gave us… Darryl banged her! Aaand is about 90% sure.  				",2,2,9
Michael," So you are the lawyer, Mr. O’Malley? I know a lot of lawyer jokes.",2,2,9
Michael," Well, it’s probably because you don’t get ’em.  				",2,2,9
Michael," When I said before that I was king of forwards, you got to understand that I don’t come up with this stuff. I just forward it along. You wouldn’t arrest a guy who’s just delivering drugs from one guy to another.  				",2,2,9
Michael, The problem is that I am the boss and apparently I can’t say anything.,2,2,9
Michael," Where’s the line? Where’s the line, Jan.",2,2,9
Michael," No, I didn’t. [to Jan] Huh, what? [everyone looks up at blow-up doll]  				",2,2,9
Michael," Attention, everyone! Hello! Ah, yes! I just want you to know that, uh, this is not my decision, but from here on out… we can no longer be friends. And when we talk about things here we must only discuss work-associated things.  And, uh, you can consider this my retirement from comedy. And in the future, if I want to say something funny or witty or do an impression, I will no longer, ever, do any of those things.",2,2,9
Michael, You would have done the same. You just didn’t think of it first.,2,2,9
Michael," Okay. [to man entering office] Hello. [introduces] Jan. Mr. O’Malley. This is my lawyer, James P. Albiny.",2,2,9
Michael, I believe you may recognize his face from the billboards. He specializes in Free Speech issues.,2,2,9
Michael," I am so used to being the bad boy. I am so used to fighting Corporate that I forget that I am Corporate. Upper management. They hooked me up with an attorney. To protect me. You can’t be too careful about what you say. Mo’ money, mo’ problems.  				",2,2,9
Michael," Okay. Well, let’s get you out of here, James. Um… I think we’re under an hour still, so… ",2,2,9
Michael, I know. We’ll talk about it later. Thanks for coming in.  				,2,2,9
Michael," Not you. Kevin. Just unwarranted. Hostile work environment, Kevin.",2,2,9
Michael," No. You said it. He pointed. A point is not a say. Look. Kevin, we are a family here and Phyllis is a valued member of that family. Like a grandmother.",2,2,9
Michael," Well, I have a late birthday and usually September’s a cut-off point. [to Kevin] You know what? You just crossed the line. Okay? There’s a line and you went over it. And you must be punished. So go to your corner.",2,2,9
Michael," They didn’t get to me. I got to them. I am still the same old Michael Scott. New and improved. You know what? I love Phyllis. You know what else? I think she is gorgeous. I think she is incredibly, incredibly attractive person. [to Phyllis] C’mere, c’mere, c’mon!  Come on! Come on.",2,2,9
Michael," You know what? The only thing I’m worried about… is getting a boner. Good work today, everybody.  				",2,2,9
Michael," Times have changed a little. And even though we’re still a family here at Dunder-Mifflin, families grow. And at some point, the daddy can’t take a bath with the kids anymore. I am Upper Management. And it would be inappropriate for me to take a bath with Pam. As much as I might want to.  				",2,2,9
Michael," Um. The sausage, egg, and cheese biscuit. But thank you. And why don’t you take a couple hours. The office is yours. “Home Alone,” “Risky Business.” Take your pants off, run around. Whatever you gotta do.",2,3,10
Michael," Ok. [Removes biscuit, leaving only sausage, egg and cheese.] Healthier. Gotta watch those carbs.   					",2,3,10
Michael," Today, I, Michael Scott, am becoming a homeowner. Investing in real estate.",2,3,10
Michael," Yes it is. Yes it is. It is very important to own property. Back in olden days, they would not even let you vote unless you owned property and they’d throw you in the stocks and humiliate you.",2,3,10
Michael," Well, this isn’t about work. This is closing on a condo, it’s completely personal. ",2,3,10
Michael," Except that, this is about my living arrangement, and as boss, I need to have a living arrangement in order to do work.",2,3,10
Michael," Oh, most honorable Pamera. Not offensive, because that’s the way they talk in movies. ",2,3,10
Michael, We are. Dwight and I are going to the big thing. So why don’t you have everybody work on their expense reports and I’d like them in by the end of the day.,2,3,10
Michael," We will. Um, did you do the thing I asked you to do about the magazines?",2,3,10
Michael," How about, uh, Fine Arts? Aficionado Monthly?",2,3,10
Michael," NO, well can you get on that, because I don’t just read Cracked.  Thank you. ",2,3,10
Michael," I don’t know, regular. Normal ones. Nothing fancy. Not my style. What are you doing?",2,3,10
Michael," What? No, Dwight. It’s fifty degrees outside.  Don’t… please…",2,3,10
Michael, I… Just… Would you put it up? [roof opens] Ok. Fine. Just leave it down. Whiner.,2,3,10
Michael, I do not understand what you spend your money on.   					,2,3,10
Michael,"  Right there. My sanctuary. My party pad. Someday I can just see my grandkids learning how to walk out here. Hang a swing from this tree. Push them back… wait… [turns around] no, it’s this one, right here. Home, sweet home.   					",2,3,10
Michael,"  Oh, how are you? Nice to meet you, Bill. Bill. Mr. Bill. OHHH NOOO. MR. BILL. OHHH! SNL? When they pull him apart? He’d always get rolled over by something. ",2,3,10
Michael,"  Yeah, small. I’m buying it and I’m not renting it. So, it’s still an upgrade. He doesn’t know anything about property ownership. Kind of an idiot. Um.   					",2,3,10
Michael,  Oh. Good. That’s good. It’s good to be accommodating of that. ,2,3,10
Michael,"  This, my friends, is the master bedroom. Check out the cathedral ceilings. Those are like seventeen feet high. We have cable readiness. [points at wall] Right there. I am going to totally pimp this place out. I am going to put a surround sound system. I am going to put a plasma screen right against this wall. ",2,3,10
Michael,"  So that’s the problem, is solved. What?",2,3,10
Michael,"  Um. Oh. [moves stove burner] Oh, ok. Is that suppose to come off?",2,3,10
Michael,  Um. I’m going to take a little breather for a second. Excuse me. ,2,3,10
Michael," Uh. [breathes deeply, head at knees]  					",2,3,10
Michael,"  The ceilings are lower than they were last week. That, I don’t… I don’t…  ",2,3,10
Michael,  …know if you showed me this same unit or not. ,2,3,10
Michael,  Where are all the hot people? I was told that there would be all these attractive singles.,2,3,10
Michael,"  As far as I can tell, I’m the best-looking person here.   					",2,3,10
Michael,"  There’s a basic principle in real estate, that you should never be the best-looking person in the development. It’s just sorta common sense, because if you are, then you’ve no place to go but down.   					",2,3,10
Michael,  I am not going to rent the third bedroom. I want a price reduction or I am a-walkin. ,2,3,10
Michael,  I made the right decision. I’m glad I signed. I’m a homeowner. Right? Good to be a homeowner. Diversifying. This is good. This is fun. We’re having fun.,2,3,10
Michael,"  There’s something else Dwight wanted to talk to you about. I have a surprise for you, for helping me out today.",2,3,10
Michael,"  No, no. I insist. I insist. Because you’ve really done some great work. Great work. And that is why, I am going to let you move into my third bedroom and pay me rent.   					",2,3,10
Michael,"  Why did I do it? Because I believe in rewarding people for their efforts. Ah. I rewarded Dwight with the room, and he is rewarding me back, ah, with $500 plus utilities.   					",2,3,10
Michael,"  I’m thinking, lock into a four year commitment, we’ll go month to month after that. Or, until I start dating, have a girlfriend, then you’re, you know, you’re gone. ",2,3,10
Michael,"  Oh, so an aquarium. Ah, that will not come into this place. ",2,3,10
Michael," EHHHHNT. Game over. Offer revoked. Dwight. I’m sorry, but you reach out and you try to be a nice guy, and help out a friend, and this is what happens. This is what I get. Oh god. I’m … Ok.   					",2,3,10
Michael," Yeah, well, you know what? Nobody cares about your stupid beet farm. Beets are the worst.",2,3,10
Michael," Nobody likes beets, Dwight. Why don’t you grow something that everybody does like? You should grow candy. I’d love a piece of candy right now. Not a beet. ",2,3,10
Michael, Yeah. Jim. Slim Jim. What’s going… What’s going on?,2,3,10
Michael," Oh. Thanks. Thanks. It’s very cool. It’s a three bedroom, gay-friendly. ",2,3,10
Michael," I don’t really know what to say. Um, I’m not one for making speeches, but ah, my heart is very full at this moment. ",2,3,10
Michael," Yep, not as good as gold. [national anthem plays] Why are you playing the national anthem?",2,3,10
Michael, Oh. [doves move across cord] What the hell is that?,2,3,10
Michael," Howard, slash Ryan, Ryan Howard is sitting in my office. And he has been a temp here for a couple of months and he’s kind of gotten the lay of the land a little bit. Had a few laughs along the way. And now he wants to know what I think. ",2,4,11
Michael," Shall we? Let us proceed. First up, proficiency in necessary skills. Aaaaeeexcellent! [laughs]  				",2,4,11
Michael," Five years from now, what do you want to do? Where do you want to be? ",2,4,11
Michael, Oh! Good. Ambitious. Excellent. Want to be a manager? ,2,4,11
Michael, Ryan’s about to attend the Michael Scott School of Business. I’m like Mr. Miyagi and Yoda rolled into one.   				,2,4,11
Michael, [speaks in a Yoda voice] Much advice you seek. [regular voice] Do you know who that is? ,2,4,11
Michael, There are ten rules of business that you need to learn.  Number one:,2,4,11
Michael, And I will give you the rest of the ten at lunch.   				,2,4,11
Michael, [to Ryan] [makes clicking noises like shooting a gun] Hey!   				,2,4,11
Michael," Yes, I was the first one out. And, yes, I’ve heard women and children first. But, we do not employ children. We are not a sweat shop. Thankfully. And, uh, women are equal in the workplace by law. So, I let them out first, I have a lawsuit on my hands.   				",2,4,11
Michael, Another rule of business is being able to adapt to different situations. ,2,4,11
Michael, Adapt. React. Re-adapt. Act. All right? That’s rule number two.   				,2,4,11
Michael," Okay, well, let’s… . let’s kind of take it a little slower. ",2,4,11
Michael," Well, he needs a permanent number, right? ",2,4,11
Michael," Um, yeah.  Okay. That… No, no, no. I got one. I got one. The Three Stooges. ",2,4,11
Michael," Rule number four. In business, image is everything – Andre Agassi. This car is an investment. Right? If I have to take out a client or I’m seen around Scranton in it. I love it. I love this car. Do you like it? ",2,4,11
Michael," Wow, some pretty big books back there, huh? ",2,4,11
Michael," Hello, Mr. Egghead! Woop!  So… oh, Stanley Kaplan! I know him. ‘M’ is for Murder, ‘P’ is for… ",2,4,11
Michael," Um, oh, thinking about business school? ",2,4,11
Michael, So you think you know a lot about business? ,2,4,11
Michael," When I was Ryan’s age, I worked in a fast food restaurant, to save up money for school. And then I spe… lost it in a pyramid scheme. But I learned more about business, right then and there, than business school would ever teach me, or Ryan would ever teach me.   				",2,4,11
Michael," [to Dwight] Shut, it. Can I… can I just do it please? [to Ryan] Uh, it’s equal. ",2,4,11
Michael," You know what, Dwight? You don’t need to help me here. Okay? Well, you know… Maybe you should go to business school like Ryan, then… then you’d know what you’re talking about. ",2,4,11
Michael," For instance, why don’t you go to business…",2,4,11
Michael," Stop. Dwight. You know what? You’re acting like a dork. Would you cool it? Please. Okay. Hey! He’s not your five year old brother, Dwight. He’s a valued member of this company… and you know what? He knows more about business than you ever will. ",2,4,11
Michael," I did not go to business school. You know who else didn’t go to business school? LeBron James, Tracy McGrady, Kobe Bryant. They went right from high school to the NBA. So… so it’s not the same thing. At all.   				",2,4,11
Michael, Look at this stuff. Market fragments. What is that supposed to be? ,2,4,11
Michael, You are so smart. You are so eff-in’ smart. You should be teaching me.   				,2,4,11
Michael," I became a salesman… because of people, I love making friends. But then I was promoted to manager, at a very young age. I still try to be a friend first, but… You know? I’m very successful… your coworkers look at you differently. Huu, what do you think? ",2,4,11
Michael," Oh, hey. Game, what game are we playing here? ",2,4,11
Michael," Oh, I play this at home all the time while I’m falling asleep. What, uh… . Where are we? Where are we here?  Mmm.. Roy? Roy? Who would you do, Roy?",2,4,11
Michael," Aaaall right. Who’s next, who’s next, who’s next, who’s? Jim? You’re next. Who would you do? ",2,4,11
Michael," Well, I would definitely have sex with Ryan. ‘Cause he is going to own his own business. ",2,4,11
Michael," Who’s, uh… Who’s next? Who we got? Whooo… ",2,4,11
Michael," Wish I had my cell phone, but I left it inside. So… ",2,4,11
Michael," Dwight, don’t! He is an idiot. The man is an idiot, ladies and gentlemen. ",2,4,11
Michael, I didn’t say it to him. I said it about him.   				,2,4,11
Michael, [in the background] How long does it take to find a cell phone? I don’t know either.,2,4,11
Michael," Seriously, where the hell is Dwight? Hey, call my cell phone. It’ll make it easier for him to find. ",2,4,11
Michael," Uh, I better tell somebody. [to fireman] Excuse me, sir… ",2,4,11
Michael," Dwight!? Great goin’. God, Man! Why did you go in there? What… Everybody was scared out of their wits, man? Oooh.",2,4,11
Michael," Wow. Okay. Well, I guess they don’t teach how to operate a toaster oven in business school. ",2,4,11
Michael," Hey, did you miss that day there, Ryan? ",2,4,11
Michael," Hey! I know what’ll impress everybody, I’ll start a fire. Oh, man. Bad idea. Bad idea jeans.   				",2,4,11
Michael, [singing] …since the world was turning.   				,2,4,11
Michael," Okay. Rule five – safety first,  i.e. don’t burn the building down. Okay? That should be a no brainer.   				",2,4,11
Michael, Oh… look! Ryan is book smart. And I am street smart. And book smart.   				,2,4,11
Michael, I’ll give you the rest of the ten tomorrow.    				,2,4,11
Michael," I know why she’s calling. It’s the end of the month, and I was supposed to let somebody go by the end of the month.  And somehow I’m supposed to put on a costume and smile. [dials a number on his speaker phone] Okay.",2,5,12
Michael," Well, I’m gonna wait till the end of the day. Because the book said it’s best to wait till the end of the day.",2,5,12
Michael, I don’t know… yet. I will have to call her back.,2,5,12
Michael," If you were getting fired, how would you wanna be told so you could still be friends with the person firing you?",2,5,12
Michael," I’ll call her back. [talks softy, to himself] Wish I could fire Sherri.",2,5,12
Michael," I mean you hear about layoffs in the news, but when you actually have to do it yourself, it is heavy stuff. It’s… these are people’s lives you’re talking about.",2,5,12
Michael," Um, Pam, I have to let somebody go today. This is, uh, the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do.",2,5,12
Michael, You’re worried about the party? There’s a man’s life at stake here.,2,5,12
Michael," No. Or a woman. A human life. If you had to guess, who it would be based on their job performance… and who you think deserved to be fired – who would that be?",2,5,12
Michael, And… sometimes you just let it go to voicemail.,2,5,12
Michael," I know. I sent away for it in July from a catalog. [bobs his head around, causing the costume head to jiggle around]",2,5,12
Michael," Oh, man. Okay, I have to fire somebody.  				",2,5,12
Michael," [looks to Oscar] Oh, boy… look at you! Haha. Showing your colors. Bet you wish you wore a dress every day.",2,5,12
Michael, All good. Happy Halloween. What happened to all those spooky decorations that we had? The cobwebs and such?,2,5,12
Michael," Well, you know what? Go buy some more. I’ll approve the overages. Sound good?",2,5,12
Michael," Good.  Oh, yeah, also about budget stuff. Um, I’m  going to need you to find, like a, a full employee salary, plus benefits, like fifty grand. I’m going to need you to find 50 grand in the numbers.",2,5,12
Michael," Well, that’s not what I’m saying. Just, you know, find it. Pretend that your jobs depend on it.  				",2,5,12
Michael," Mmm-hm-hmm. Interesting take on Dorothy. I love it. Hey, you know what would even be better? Soccer ball and cleats.",2,5,12
Michael," Well, I don’t really have two heads. So…   				",2,5,12
Michael, It’s not a popularity contest. Although it does make sense to fire the least popular because it has the least effect on morale.    				,2,5,12
Michael," [turns to the fake head, listening] What? There was someone left off that list? Who?",2,5,12
Michael," You’re right, I didn’t even think of him.",2,5,12
Michael," Yeah, that’s actually a really good idea.",2,5,12
Michael, That is not a very nice thing to say about him.,2,5,12
Michael, So. How did it go with Stanley? How… how’d he take it?,2,5,12
Michael," I don’t wanna fire Stanley. I never said that. I’m certainly not going to do it myself. Get those big, baleful, eyes staring at me. Yikes. Just, okay, just… [waves Dwight away]  				",2,5,12
Michael, What?! That would’ve solved all my problems.,2,5,12
Michael," If you left, I wouldn’t have to fire anybody.",2,5,12
Michael," Big deal. Oh, it would’ve worked out so well. Can you get it back?",2,5,12
Michael, Wohahah! Why are you torturing me?! God.  				,2,5,12
Michael, [clearing his throat and interrupting Jim’s talking head] Can I speak to you a minute?,2,5,12
Michael," I want you to role play firing me. I want you to fire me, and I will take it.",2,5,12
Michael," I want you to be me, and I will be Creed.",2,5,12
Michael," No, no, no. That’s just the first thing… came… in head.",2,5,12
Michael," I’m going to kill myself, and it’s your fault!",2,5,12
Michael, Corporate is really breathing down my neck. And they’re saying this has to be done by the end of the month.,2,5,12
Michael," I’m improvising, so just try to keep up. [phone rings]",2,5,12
Michael, I’m gonna kill you. I’m going to kill you for firing me.,2,5,12
Michael," Get off, get off. No, no. OK.. just get off.[sits back down in his chair and waves Jim off.] Just, just… yeah.  				",2,5,12
Michael, Could I talk to you for a second?  				,2,5,12
Michael," You are great. Very ambitious. And I feel like you want more than this little office has to offer. And I understand that you’d wanna just spread your wings, and fly the coop.",2,5,12
Michael, I… we’re gonna have to… You… you want something better.,2,5,12
Michael," No, of course  you can’t go. We haven’t even started this horrible process of… okay, Creed. I need to let somebody go today. They told me I need to let somebody go. And as much as I think you’re a great guy, and I like you, you’re… you’re, goodbye.",2,5,12
Michael, What old days? What are you talking about?,2,5,12
Michael, I can’t change anything. This is the way… ,2,5,12
Michael," Yeah, I went hunting once. Shot the deer in the leg, had to kill it with a shovel. Took about an hour. Why do you ask?  				",2,5,12
Michael," Okay, well… I already picked you. And you know that. So, unless I just go through with this, you’re always gonna look at me as the guy who almost fired you.",2,5,12
Michael," Devon, could I talk to you for a sec?  				",2,5,12
Michael," Huh. No! I can’t, no. I can’t go back. I would look like an idiot.",2,5,12
Michael," No. It was all the stuff that I said. It was the business downturn, the cutbacks, and, and… ",2,5,12
Michael, I just hope that you and I can remain friends.   				,2,5,12
Michael," Look, look. In addition to severance, and everything, I want to give you this gift certificate to Chili’s. From me. Okay? No hard feelings.",2,5,12
Michael," I  love Halloween. You know, it’s just, it’s just fun. Every year, it’s just fun. Last Halloween I came as Janet Jackson’s boob. It was topical. People got a… a big kick out of it. The year before that, I came as Monica Lewinsky, and I wore a stained dress. The year before that, I also came as Monica Lewinsky. And before that, I was O.J. It was pretty funny. Oh, I wish you were here last year.  				",2,5,12
Michael," He… Hey, hey, hey, hey! How you doing? Wow! You guys looks great.",2,5,12
Michael," You’re a lion. [trying to to open a bag of candy] Wow, I want to hear your, your… Oh! [the bag tears open, spilling all the candy] Oh, okay, that’s all yours. That’s all yours. Grab it, grab it. You know what? You guys are getting all of these.  				",2,5,12
Michael," [singing and tapping on his coffee mug] I don’t want to work, I just want to bang on this mug all day.",2,6,13
Michael," Uhh, yes, I did, here’s the dizzle. I have a very top secret mission for you. I want you to update all the emergency contact information.",2,6,13
Michael," [to Pam] Hello, oh God, busy work. Ahh, get away, cretin.",2,6,13
Michael," Last year they were out of order, weren’t they Pam?",2,6,13
Michael," Chillax, Pam. Stop Pam-M-S-ing. That’s pretty good. Um, actually, I’m sending Ryan on a top secret mission. Tell her what it is.",2,6,13
Michael," Is it a priority? Oh I don’t know, um, what if there is a tornado, Pam? People’s legs are crushed under rubble. “Please, would you be so kind as to call my wife? No, I can’t because we don’t have any emergency contact information because Pam said it wasn’t a priority.” Think. Think with your head, Pam. Ok, well. She walks out. That’s the problem with being a boss is that when you are tough they resent you and when you are cool they walk all over you.",2,6,13
Michael," Catch-22. Yes. Why don’t you give me your contact information to start with, ok, what’s your cell?  					",2,6,13
Michael," [in his office on his cell phone, talking in a fake high voice] Hey Ryan. This is Michael Jackson calling from Wonderland.",2,6,13
Michael, [Taps on the glass in his office to get Ryan’s attention] Pick up.,2,6,13
Michael, [in a high pitched voice] This is Mike Tyson.  					,2,6,13
Michael," And this is more a ying-yang thing. The ‘Michael’ all cursive, the ‘Scott’ all caps. Left brain, right brain. Or, duality of man. ",2,6,13
Michael," Yeah, yeah, I don’t think that would happen.",2,6,13
Michael," They told me. After. You see, I used to run with a very tough crowd. Street Fighter types. Real, real bad people, I’m just lucky I got out.   					",2,6,13
Michael," And after that, nobody ever messed with the ‘Damn Rascals’ ever again. ",2,6,13
Michael," Yes, in theory, I have. I just need to cross some t’s and dot some i’s. Alright, I’m going to be in my office if anybody needs me. [Puts Dwight in a headlock] Hoo-hah. Oh, wow, sleeper hold. That’s my rebuttal. Shhh. Hoo. You are the weakest link. ",2,6,13
Michael," I’m friends with everybody in this office. We’re all best friends – I love everybody here. But sometimes your best friends start coming into work late, and start having dentist appointments that aren’t dentist appointments. And that’s when it is nice to let them know that you can beat them up.   					",2,6,13
Michael," Oh, queer… [realizes he is on camera] eye. Queer eye. That’s a good show. Important show. Go ahead. Do it.",2,6,13
Michael," Oh yeah, that would be kind of worthless because I know a ton of fourteen year old girls who can kick his ass.",2,6,13
Michael," Look, Dwight is a wuss. When we rented ‘Armageddon’… ",2,6,13
Michael," Oh, Bruce Willis. Are they going to leave him on the asteroid?",2,6,13
Michael, Yeah. [Jim opens office door for Michael] Thank you.   					,2,6,13
Michael," Come in. Um, Pam, I hate to break this to you but Dwight can’t stop you from being mugged. He’s just not tough enough. ",2,6,13
Michael," Oh, I could beat up Dwight. That’s ridiculous. I could murder him. ",2,6,13
Michael," Watch out Kelly, he might sucker punch you.",2,6,13
Michael," Really? Well, the offer, Dwight, was for one punch which I absorbed. I had no idea that there would be a second punch. So, catch-22. ",2,6,13
Michael," Look, if we were in a bar right now, there would be two punches:",2,6,13
Michael, You know what? You’re just lucky that we are at work right now.,2,6,13
Michael, I recognize that. That is Japanese for California Roll. ,2,6,13
Michael, I think it is. A guy told me about that.,2,6,13
Michael," Alotta rules. Alotta rules. On the street we didn’t have any rules. Maybe one – no kicks to the groin, home for dinner. ",2,6,13
Michael," I’m comin’ atcha man. Ok, purple belt, ok. I got him.",2,6,13
Michael," Dwight, you have… No, you have something… God, you look like such an idiot! [Lots of yelling and flailing of arms by Michael and Dwight]",2,6,13
Michael," Go on, I dare you to kick there again. Kick there again, I dare ya.",2,6,13
Michael," You can’t see. You can’t see. Good boy. Good boy. Great boy. Two points, three points, four points. I win. I win. [Michael is using his head guard to hit Dwight] Eight points. Nine points. [Begins to hock a loogie]",2,6,13
Michael," You talkin’ to me? You talkin’ to me? “Raging Bull.” Pacino. Oh, I want that footage. I want it. I need it. Ah, I have to get back to work. I have lots of work… Oh, oh check this out. Come here. [Michael opens his blinds and looks at Ryan in the parking lot] There he is. Mr. Temp. Having lunch by the car. Let us play with him. This’ll be hilarious. [Calls Ryan on the phone, Ryan doesn’t pick up after seeing that Michael is calling] Oh, we’re playing phone tag.   					",2,6,13
Michael, My emergency contact is Todd Packer. Todd F. Packer. Do you know what the F. stands for?,2,6,13
Michael," [knock at the door] Yeah… uh, come in. Oh, hey Karate Kid. The Hillary Swank version. Hi. How are ya? ",2,6,13
Michael," He is such a sore loser. You heard, obviously, that I mopped the floor with him this afternoon. You know what, um, do yourself a favor and just keep me as his contact and I will call the hospital. Cut out the middle man.   					",2,6,13
Michael," Yeah, just throw them on the chair. I’ll take it from here. So, whatcha up to this weekend? ",2,6,13
Michael," If you’re doing anything crazy, give me a shout.",2,6,13
Michael," This close. Dwight, may I speak with you for a minute?",2,6,13
Michael," Well, [points at himself] busier. Making the time.  ",2,6,13
Michael," Well, you don’t even have anyone to go home to, Toby. ",2,6,13
Michael," I know, but I’ve been carrying the load on my back all day, and if everybody would just chip in a little bit, it’d might help me out. What do you say? Let’s gangbang this thing and go home. Good? Dwight.   					",2,6,13
Michael, I have been testing you the entire day. Did you know that? ,2,6,13
Michael, And I am happy to say that you have passed. So effective immediately I am promoting you from Assistant to the Regional Manager to Assistant Regional Manager. ,2,6,13
Michael," I know, I know, I know, I wouldn’t be offering it if I didn’t think you could handle it.",2,6,13
Michael," No, no. Three month probationary period. Let’s not tell anybody about this right now.",2,6,13
Michael," I told Dwight that there is honor in losing. Which, as we all know, is completely ridiculous, but there is, however, honor in making a loser feel better which is what I just did for Dwight. Would I rather be feared or loved? Um, easy. Both. I want people to be afraid of how much they love me. And I think I proved that today at the dojo.   					",2,6,13
Michael," Wow, graphs and charts, somebody’s really been doing their homework.  Looks like USA Today.",2,7,14
Michael," Radisson just gives out this vibe, “Oh, I’m doing business at the Radisson”.  It’s kind of snooty.  So.",2,7,14
Michael, Here’s the thing. Chili’s is the new golf course.  It’s where business happens.  Small Businessman Magazine.  ,2,7,14
Michael, It will.  I sent it in.  Letter to the editor.,2,7,14
Michael," Uh huh, uh huh. [under his breath] Power trip.",2,7,14
Michael," Ok, let’s do this thing.  [to Pam] Wish us luck.",2,7,14
Michael," [under his breath] Kiss ass.  Ok, probably going to go late tonight.  Burning the midnight tequila.  So, I think you could all just take off now.",2,7,14
Michael," No, no.  That would not be efficient.  Actually, they just don’t get very much work done when I’m not here.  [Jan stares at Michael] That’s not true.  I know how to delegate, and they do more work done when I’m not here.  Not more.  The same amount of work is done, whether I am here or not. [another Jan stare]  Hey, everybody, listen up.  This is what we’re gonna do.  You sit tight, until I return.  Sound good?  Doesn’t matter, it’s an order.  Follow it blindly, mwahahaha, ok?  Alright, ciao.  [to Oscar] Adios!  ",2,7,14
Michael," It’s just a couple blocks away, so… boy, you really don’t know Scranton, do you?",2,7,14
Michael," You ever been to Scranton, Jan? Dar de-",2,7,14
Michael," Jan Levinson-Gould.  Jan is cold.  If she was sitting across from you on a train and she wasn’t moving, you might think she was dead.  ",2,7,14
Michael, We should come up with a signal of some sort.,2,7,14
Michael," Well, in case one of us gets into trouble, the other one can signal-",2,7,14
Michael, Thought that was you.  Hi.  Michael Scott.  This is Jan Levinson-Gould.,2,7,14
Michael," Wow, you’re kidding me!  Do you wanna talk about?",2,7,14
Michael," [to Christian] I think we should share an Awesome Blossom, what do you say?   They are awesome. Want to, Christian, blossom?",2,7,14
Michael," Ok, it’s done. Actually, [turns around] Megan, may we have an Awesome Blossom, please, extra awesome?  Now it’s done.",2,7,14
Michael, Very very funny joke the other day.  Wanna hear it?,2,7,14
Michael," Just one joke.  Ok.  Well, if it’s just gonna be one, I will think of a different joke.  Umm… let’s see… choo choo choo.  ",2,7,14
Michael," Pam, it’s Michael.  I need you to go into my office and check some data for me.  ",2,7,14
Michael, Nope.  Told it.  Not as good as you think.  Pick another one.,2,7,14
Michael," Oh ho ho, yea!  Bingo! And a lighthouse.  Yes.  That is hysterical.  Could you start that one from the beginning?",2,7,14
Michael," First guy says “Well, I’m an astronaut, so I drive a Saturn”.  And the second guy says, “Well, I am a pimp, so I drive a cheap Escort”.  And the third guy says “I gotcha both beat, I’m a proctologist, so I drive a brown Probe”.",2,7,14
Michael, [making the mouth on his tie talk]  Yum! Yum yum yum! [Christian laughs]  That’s delicious!  I love it!,2,7,14
Michael," That’s why I wanted a signal, between us, so that I wouldn’t have to just shout non-sense words.  That’s her fault.  ",2,7,14
Michael, Did somebody say “baby back ribs”?  Hmmm? Hmmmmm?,2,7,14
Michael," [singing] I want my baby back, baby back, baby back [Christian laughs]",2,7,14
Michael," Woo, well, this brings us to Jan.  Truth or Dare?  Tell us about your divorce. Ohh, ohh.",2,7,14
Michael," Oh, so you’re not gonna play?  She’s not playing.",2,7,14
Michael," No, you were not stupid.  Gould was stupid.  Right?",2,7,14
Michael," Uh huh, Kenneth Road, born and raised.  Spent my whole life right here in Lackawanna County and I do not intend on movin’.  I know this place.  I know how many hospitals we have, I know how many schools we have.  It’s home, you know?  I know the challenges this county’s up against.  Here’s the thing about those discount suppliers.  They don’t care.  They come in, they undercut everything, and they run us out of business, and then, once we’re all gone, they jack up the prices.",2,7,14
Michael," Well, corporate’s gonna go ballistic, but, uh, you think we could Jan?  ",2,7,14
Michael, Goin’. Ok.  Where we goin’?  Doesn’t matter.  Goin’ to the go go. [nervous laugh] Oh-ok.  ,2,7,14
Michael," No, nothing happened.  I-I swear, nothing happened.  What, I’m, totally being serious.  A gentleman does not kiss and tell, and neither do I. [laughs] No, seriously, guys, I’m not, I don’t want to go into it at all.  It’s off limits.  Fine, I took her back to her hotel and we made out for a little while.  It was great.  I mean she told me about her divorce, we talked for about five hours, she fell asleep on my arm.  So.  ",2,7,14
Michael, This is none of your affair because she is your boss-,2,7,14
Michael," And she is a woman.  She is a strong, soft, thoughtful, sexy woman.  And you know what?  I don’t think that I can sit here and let you talk about her that way without me defending her honor. [to camera]  Jan, I defend your honor.  [to Dwight]  Is that all?  ",2,7,14
Michael, I know we have to register as a consensual sexual relationship with HR.  My question:,2,7,14
Michael," Pam, could I see you in my office?  				",2,8,15
Michael," And I want you to listen to a voicemail from my boss. [Jan on recording] “Michael, it’s Jan. I guess I missed you.  I’ll, uh, be there this afternoon for performance reviews.  I hope it’s understood that that will be our only topic of discussion. See you soon.”  First impressions?",2,8,15
Michael," My boss is coming in today, the lovely Jan Levinson-Gould will, well, no Gould. The Gould has been [makes slashing neck hand motion] swack, divorced.  Um, the awkward part is that this will be the first time that we’ll be seeing each other since, well, uh, it was really nothing.  We just sort of got caught up in the moment.  The vulnerable divorcee gives herself to the understanding, with rugged good-looks, office manager.  Just, uh, she didn’t want it to continue for some reason.  It, we both, I didn’t want it, we both didn’t want it to continue.  Was not professional.  Um, when people say something’s mutual, it never is.  But this was mutual.  				",2,8,15
Michael," [playing Jan’s message] “I guess I missed you.” I guess I missed you.  So, she misses me?",2,8,15
Michael," But then she goes on to say “that will be our only topic of discussion”.  That doesn’t mean anything, those are just words.",2,8,15
Michael," Ohhh, great.  Well, now I’m in a terrible mood.  Let’s do your performance review-",2,8,15
Michael," Ah, why, that’s great news?   That, that, then why would, why would I not like that?",2,8,15
Michael," Oh, wow, wow.  Alright, let’s listen to that again. [plays Jan’s message] “Michael, it’s Jan.  I guess I missed you”.  				",2,8,15
Michael," God, Stanley, that’s frickin’ brilliant. How do you know that?  Did you learn that on the streets?  Sorry.",2,8,15
Michael," Good work, Stanley. Great performance review.  Stanley in the house, everybody.  Woo!  Angela, your turn.  				",2,8,15
Michael," Oh; Angela, you were totally satisfactory this year.  				",2,8,15
Michael, Interesting.  Jan is calling me.  Maybe it wasn’t so mutual after all. [puts Jan on speakerphone] Yeah?,2,8,15
Michael," Well, hello to you, too.  Um, yeah, I was just um, I just wanted to get some closure on uh, what transpired between us at the meeting we had in the parking lot of the Chili’s.",2,8,15
Michael," Well, surely this uh, review is a formality because of what happened uh, at our meeting in the parking lot of Chili’s.",2,8,15
Michael," Um, I don’t see how that’s unprofessional. Just-",2,8,15
Michael," They are not.  Yes, they are. [Jan hangs up]  That’s my girlfriend.  				",2,8,15
Michael," Pam, I have ideas on a daily basis. I know I do.  I have a clear memory of telling people my ideas.  Um, is there any chance you wrote any of my ideas down?  In a folder?  A “Michael-idea” folder?",2,8,15
Michael, That’s unfortunate.  How ’bout the suggestion box?  There’s tons of ideas in there.,2,8,15
Michael," The suggestion box that I put out, and people could be put in suggestions anonymously?  Maybe there’s prizes?",2,8,15
Michael," Why don’t you find it and tell people to get theirs… never mind, I’ll tell them.  Hello, everybody?  Yeah, uh, attention, please.  Jan Levinson’s coming, very soon, and so, we’re going to have our weekly suggestion box meeting, so you can all get your constructive compliments in a.s.a.p.",2,8,15
Michael," Well, Kelly, that was neither constructive nor a compliment, so maybe you should stop criticizing my English and start making some suggestions. ‘K?  				",2,8,15
Michael," Ok. [tries to kiss Jan’s hand] Ok, why don’t we just step into my office?  We’re gonna go in here.",2,8,15
Michael," Yep, right after you.  Apres-vous. [mouths to Pam] No calls.",2,8,15
Michael," I’m a little confused.  ‘Cause first it’s all like kissy-kissy.  And then it’s like all regret.  Because “Oh, I regret that.”  But, “Wait, I’m still gonna call you.”  But, but, “We’re just gonna talk business.  And I may come down and fire you if you don’t do your job.”  But what were talking about when we first kissed?  Business.  				",2,8,15
Michael," No, no, no, I finished all of that.  I’m very fast.  I’m not too fast.  Not like wham-bam-thank ya ma’am.  But I do say thank ya ma’am.  But, I’m, I’m not like wham-bam.  Not that there’s anything wrong with wham-bam.  If it’s consensual.  [cold Jan stare]  We’re talking about office stuff.  Can I ask you a question?",2,8,15
Michael," This is a business question. It’s nothing personal, I promise.",2,8,15
Michael," Well, you’re wearing it at the office. And [smells Jan] it, I’m sorry, but no offense, but it’s really sexy.",2,8,15
Michael," I don’t understand- [phone rings] Hold on.  Sorry. [answers]  Yes, Pam.",2,8,15
Michael, I’m kind of in the middle of something. I wish you wouldn’t interrupt.,2,8,15
Michael," Why are we here?  Because I value your opinions.  Now, I know a lot of don’t think that I read your suggestions, but I do.  I just sift through them every week and I really look and scrutinize to see what you guys are writing.  Um, so, let’s, uh, just read some of these suckers.  Alright.  Number one:",2,8,15
Michael," Well, obviously this one got stuck in the box. [to Jan] That happens occasionally.",2,8,15
Michael, Tom.  Then it is a joke because there is nobody in here named Tom.,2,8,15
Michael," Oh, that guy?  That guy was weird.  Alright, next suggestion.",2,8,15
Michael," Arrr, dooby dooby do. “You need to do something about your B.O.”",2,8,15
Michael," Ok, I don’t know who this suggestion is meant for, but it’s more of a personal suggestion and it’s not an office suggestion.  Far be it for me to use this as a platform to embarrass anybody.",2,8,15
Michael," Well, Toby, if by me you are inferring that I have B.O., then I would say that is a very poor choice of words.",2,8,15
Michael," Was I, Creed?!  Ok, well, you know what? I am implying is that when we’re on an elevator together, I should maybe take the stairs, because talk about stank.  Not that I would ever say something like that in public, and I never have, and I never will. I just think it’s something that we should all be aware of.  Ok?  Now that we’ve learned this, let’s continue.  See, this is good, we’re learning and we’re figuring some stuff out.  “You need to do something about your coffee breath”-",2,8,15
Michael," Shut up, shut up, shut up, Dwight, OK. I don’t think you people are grasping the concept of the suggestion box.",2,8,15
Michael," Yeah, is that hard for you?  Alright, well-",2,8,15
Michael," Let’s keep going.  Keep it going.  Yep.  What do we have here?  We have somebody’s piece of gum.  Somebody put a piece of gum in there.  This is not a, a garbage can, this is the future of our company.  This is not a place for gum.  I don’t wanna have to read these tomorrow.",2,8,15
Michael," Yeah, what? Uh, alright, next suggestion.",2,8,15
Michael," “Don’t sl-“, ok, that’s blank [Dwight picks up note] Don’t, just put it-",2,8,15
Michael, I don’t understand why you’re so upset.,2,8,15
Michael, I just don’t understand why you have to pretend like nothing happened.,2,8,15
Michael," Ok, great.  Your performance has been adequate.  You may leave; goodbye.",2,8,15
Michael," You wanna talk now, good; OK, Dwight, leave.  ",2,8,15
Michael, Why on earth would we give you a raise?,2,8,15
Michael, That is a serious offense. Very serious.  As is toying with a man’s heart.,2,8,15
Michael," Ok, third wheel, why don’t you do that?",2,8,15
Michael," Wait, wait, wait, come, I just, I just wanna know why?",2,8,15
Michael," Ok, so you’re saying that there is a different time or place?",2,8,15
Michael," Well, ok, well never as in ‘never ever ever’, or never as in there’s still a chance?",2,8,15
Michael," I just want to know, from the horse’s mouth, what is the dealio?",2,8,15
Michael, So my looks have nothing to do with it?,2,8,15
Michael, Jan is not in a place where she feels she can have a relationship right now.  And it doesn’t matter how great a guy I am.  And that is all I needed; I’m good.  I can go home now.    				,2,8,15
Michael," Hey, it’s 12:20; where the hell’s Dwight?  ",2,8,15
Michael," There’s no time to think about if this is real.  Just, shh, everybody. [knock at the front door]",2,9,16
Michael, The IT tech guy and me did not get off to a great start.  				,2,9,16
Michael," Yeah, I tried to install it myself, but, uh, you guys have these things so password-protected… ",2,9,16
Michael," Oh, umm… [looks at Post-It on computer]",2,9,16
Michael," Dwight, nothing is going to happen to me, ok?  I’m in the best shape of my life.  Look at this. [flexes his arms] Brrr!  That’s strong!",2,9,16
Michael," Uh, oh, ok; if I step on a mine in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and die, you can have my job, ok?  Why don’t you just go… away?  				",2,9,16
Michael," There are certain things a boss does not share with his employees.  His salary, that would depress them.  His bed, it—  And I am not going to tell them that I’ll be reading their e-mails.    				",2,9,16
Michael," Try “profits”.  No! Try “Michael Scott”.  “Michael” “boss” and “funny”. [Sadiq (IT guy) types; result pops up] Oh my God, wow!  [chuckles]  E-mail from Stanley. Stanley,  Terribly nice guy.  [reads e-mail]  “Sorry I didn’t write back sooner; I can’t go to the game tonight because my boss Michael is an ass and making me stay late.”  Well, Stanley’s an ass.  Not one of our harder workers.  				",2,9,16
Michael," Oh, no, everybody; Oscar’s gone crazy!  What other ghost stories do you have for us?  That I’m a robot? [robot voice]  I will destroy everything in my path-",2,9,16
Michael, Bommmm. Bop! Onk onk.  [Tin Man voice] Oil can. Oil can.,2,9,16
Michael," Oh, what? No. That defeats the whole purpose.",2,9,16
Michael," The problem is that when people hear the term “big brother”, they immediately think it’s scary or bad, but I don’t. I think, wow, I love my big brother.  				",2,9,16
Michael," Meredith has an E-vite from Jim.  Barbeque at Jim’s tonight.  Tonight?  Wonder where my e-vitation is.  Click on guest list.  Angela, Stanley, Oscar, Meredith, Phyllis, Kevin, Creed.  Must be… .[scrolls down list] No.  				",2,9,16
Michael," There’s always a distance between a boss and the employees.  It is just nature’s rule.  It’s intimidation mostly, it’s the awareness that they are not me.  I do think that I am very approachable, as one of the guys.  But maybe I need to be even approachabler.  				",2,9,16
Michael," Of course.  Hangin’ with my crew, crew that I am one of.  Hangin’ with my Cup of Noodles.  This is a meal in a cup.",2,9,16
Michael," Hot, tasty.  Reminds me of college.  Lived on this stuff.  Brain food.  Mmmm… You know what I really, really miss about college?  The parties.  Everybody’d go.  The athletes, the, the nerds, professors.",2,9,16
Michael, Yeah!  They were the most fun.  We always invited them.  				,2,9,16
Michael," One more hour.  Take care of anything you forgot to do. Hey, you know, I don’t know if you have any plans tonight, but if ya don’t, we could hang out.",2,9,16
Michael," Tonight, I can’t do it tonight, no.  Improv class, I have improv class, hanging out with my improv buds-",2,9,16
Michael," It’s the best.  It’s the best.  I would not miss it for the world.  But if something else came up, I would definitely not go.",2,9,16
Michael," Hey, Pam.  Do you need me to walk to your vehicular transport?",2,9,16
Michael," Alright.  Oscar, got big plans tonight with-",2,9,16
Michael," Kevin, big man, big man, what are you doing tonight?  Where are you off to?",2,9,16
Michael," Hey, Angela, rushy, rushy.  Where you rushin’ off to?",2,9,16
Michael," Dwight, oh ho, Dwight, Dwight, my loyal compadre.  You and I are hangin’ tonight.  The two of us.  We are celebrating our freedom and our manhood.  You know what?  Why don’t we watch that show that you’ve been wanting to watch, that stupid Battleship Galaxy.",2,9,16
Michael," I didn’t know you played soccer, Dwight.",2,9,16
Michael," [In Horshack voice from ‘Welcome Back, Kotter’] Ooo Ooo Ooo Ooo, Mr. Cart-air, Mr. Cart-air.",2,9,16
Michael, [fake kicks in door] Boom! Detective Michael Scarn.  I’m with the FBI.  				,2,9,16
Michael," Think about this; what is the most exciting thing that can happen, on TV, or in movies, or in real life?  Somebody has a gun. [gasps]  That’s why I always start with a gun, because you can’t top it, you just can’t.    				",2,9,16
Michael," Boom!  Freeze!  Michael Scoon, FBI.  You know what you did.  Boom! Boom! Boom! [shoots at Pregnant Girl and another actor]  Yeah, you thought that you could get away with your little ruse, didn’t you?  Didn’t ya!?  Well, you didn’t, because I know where ya hid the diamonds.  I been on to you and your little friends for weeks.  [another actor steps in]  Boom! Boom! Boom!",2,9,16
Michael," Well, if you hadn’t stopped the scene, you would have seen where it was going.",2,9,16
Michael," No, no, no.  I’m looking in my wallet for money so you can tell me my fortune.",2,9,16
Michael," Good, it’s good.  Good work, everybody.  				",2,9,16
Michael," So Bernie’s, huh?  We’re all going to Bernie’s? [to camera]  Go to Bernie’s?",2,9,16
Michael," Right, right, right.  Well guys, I’d love to go to Bernie’s with you, but, you know, I have an office party.  A big office party I need to go to, so…  Can’t get out of it.",2,9,16
Michael," Ok, see you later.  Nice job, Bill.  Not.  				",2,9,16
Michael," Wow!  Who opened the morgue for this thing?  I’m just driving by, thought I’d drop in.  [to Jim] There’s some wine. I would love a glass, if you’re gonna open it.  Here ya go Temp, take my jacket!  [sees Sadiq (IT guy)] Oh, come on! That guy?  He is a good guy, not a terrorist.  Karaoke, I love it!  I am a karaoke fiend.  I call dibs. I got next, I got next up.  Come on, let’s get this party started, ha! Ok?  Where’s that wine?  				",2,9,16
Michael," Ok, yeah, this is a duet, so, need somebody else, Pam?  You wanna come up and sing this one?  Need somebody else.  Takers, please.  [singing]  Baby when I met you there was peace unknown. Kelly?  Tried to get you with a fine tooth comb.  I was soft inside, there was something goin’ on.  This part goes to the, uh, girl.  You do something to me that I can’t explain.  Hold me closer and I feel no pain.  In every beat of my heart, we got something goin’ on.  Tender love is blind—",2,9,16
Michael," You shove it. Shove it back! Here we go. Don’t break the branches, Dwight.",2,10,17
Michael," Well, suck it up. We all have problems. Hey, everybody, look what we have! [laughs] Nice, huh?",2,10,17
Michael," A, that’s what she said, and B, I wanted it to be impressive. The biggest day of the year deserves the biggest tree of the year.",2,10,17
Michael," Well, that is a perfectly good mini-tree, Kevin. And we are going to sell that to charity. That’s what Christmas is all about.  				",2,10,17
Michael," [comes into the conference room in a Santa hat and beard]  Merry Christmas! Ho, ho, ho, [points to Ryan] pimp. I’m kidding. What do we got, what do we got? How many plates are we getting?",2,10,17
Michael, Double it. Double everything. Double ice cream. Double napkins. Double it. On me.  				,2,10,17
Michael," It was a tough year. I had to fire somebody this year. This party has to really rock. Check it out. Christmas bonus. 3,000 G’s. I got this for helping save the company money. So I guess some good came out of firing Devon after all. Maybe I should call him and tell him that.  				",2,10,17
Michael," I want people to cut loose. I want people making out in closets. I want people hanging from the ceilings, lamp shades on the heads. I want it to be a Playboy Mansion party. And also, I want you to spread the word that I will have my digital camera. And I’ll be taking pictures all along the way. And the best and craziest thing that happens will be on the cover of the newsletter. Incentive.",2,10,17
Michael," Yeah, I know. Damn it. Stupid corporate wet blankets. Like booze ever killed anybody.  				",2,10,17
Michael, That makes sense because he has elfish features.  				,2,10,17
Michael, I think I got something pretty nice for my guy.,2,10,17
Michael, I spent a lot of dough. Lot of dough. Wow.,2,10,17
Michael, Yeah. I wanted this party to be really special so I sorta went above and beyond.,2,10,17
Michael," All right, let’s count it down, like Rockefeller Center. Ready?",2,10,17
Michael," No, no. Shake it off, everybody. Just, let’s do Secret Santa.  				",2,10,17
Michael," Presents are the best way to show someone how much you care. It’s like this tangible thing that you can point to and say, “Hey, man, I love you this many dollars worth.”  				",2,10,17
Michael," Whoa. Wow. Jeez. Somebody really got carried away with the spirit of Christmas. That was me, I got a little carried away.",2,10,17
Michael," What? Oh, shoot. Wow. Okay, well, who cares? It doesn’t matter what I spent. What matters is that Christmas is fun, right?",2,10,17
Michael," Oh hey, for me. What is in here? [opens a handmade oven mitt] Oh, come on.",2,10,17
Michael," So Phyllis is basically saying, “Hey Michael, I know you did a lot to help the office this year but I only care about you a homemade oven mitt’s worth.” I gave Ryan an iPod.  				",2,10,17
Michael, I got it! We are going to turn Secret Santa into Yankee Swap.,2,10,17
Michael," One person chooses a gift. The next person can either choose a gift or steal that person’s gift. If your gift gets stolen, then you can steal somebody else’s gift or choose a new gift.",2,10,17
Michael, Because it’s better. Because it’s more special.,2,10,17
Michael," Shut it. No, it’s not. Okay, just give it a shot.  				",2,10,17
Michael," Okay, Meredith is up first. Here’s the deal. You can either pick a new gift or you can steal somebody else’s gift that they’ve already gotten, like the oven mitt.",2,10,17
Michael," Yankee Swap! That’s what makes it fun. Pam, you can steal the oven mitt now.",2,10,17
Michael, Everyone wants the iPod. It’s a huge hit. It is almost a Christmas miracle.  				,2,10,17
Michael," Oh, well, Oscar, you little gourmand, you have the next turn.",2,10,17
Michael," [holding oven mitt] I hope nobody takes this baby, cause this is great. Wow, look at that fine craftsmanship. Somebody really put a lot of work into that. It’s beautiful.",2,10,17
Michael," Sucker! See, I wanted somebody to take it. Boom! Reverse psychology.  				",2,10,17
Michael," Reverse psychology is an awesome tool. I don’t know if you guys know about it, but basically you make someone think the opposite of what you believe and that tricks them into doing something stupid. Works like a charm.  				",2,10,17
Michael," [opens present] “In addition to these paintball pellets, your gift includes two paintball lessons with Dwight Schrute.”",2,10,17
Michael, Who wants to take paintball lessons? How is that better than an iPod?,2,10,17
Michael, [after Phyllis leaves suddenly] What is she so upset about?,2,10,17
Michael, Come on! I think that Yankee Swap was a big hit! I think it’s a success and I’m the one who ended up with Dwight’s stupid paintball pellets.,2,10,17
Michael," Well, I didn’t. I got a big bonus because I fired Devon, and I used the money to buy something awesome. Sue me!",2,10,17
Michael," It wasn’t. It wasn’t that much. It was $3,000.",2,10,17
Michael," Unbelievable. I do the nicest thing that anyone has ever done for these people and they freak out. Well, happy birthday, Jesus. Sorry your party’s so lame.  				",2,10,17
Michael," All right, now, you’re the expert. Is this enough to get 20 people plastered?",2,10,17
Michael, Uh-oh. Looks like Santa was a little naughty.,2,10,17
Michael," This is Christmas spirit, as in spirits, booze.",2,10,17
Michael," Zip it, Toby! Just .. I mean, it’s a party. Come on. If I can’t throw a good party for my employees, then I am a terrible boss. Who wants a drink?",2,10,17
Michael," Anybody making out in here? [checks hallway] Not yet, give it time. Oh, hey, Ebenezer, boink. [takes picture of Jim] Okay, how’s it going in here? [takes picture of Meredith and Kevin]",2,10,17
Michael," No, no, no, no. We’ll find some, don’t leave the party.  				",2,10,17
Michael," Kudos to Ryan, king of the party committee.",2,10,17
Michael," Oh, no, no. No false modesty, my friend.  				",2,10,17
Michael," Not bad. And if it couldn’t go to Ryan, you are the guy I’d want it to go to.",2,10,17
Michael," No way. Oh, you’re kidding me. Packer! Yes! Todd Packer, ladies and gentlemen!",2,10,17
Michael," Oh, no, no. Oh look at that. Icing on the cake.",2,10,17
Michael," Oh, let’s fix you up. Who wants to fix up .. Toby. Toby’s gonna fix you up.  				",2,10,17
Michael, Darryl. There you go. [hands him the Santa hat] You earned it.,2,10,17
Michael," No, no, no, no. I really, really want you to have it.",2,10,17
Michael, [coming out of his office] Lampshade on head! It’s happening!  				,2,10,17
Michael," Christmas is awesome. First of all, you get to spend time with people you love. Secondly, you can get drunk and no one can say anything. Third, you give presents. What’s better than giving presents? And fourth, getting presents. So, four things. Not bad for one day. It’s really the greatest day of all time.  				",2,10,17
Michael," Hey, Meredith. Heading over to Poor Richard’s? ",2,10,17
Michael," Cool, cool, cool. Do you need a ride? [Meredith drops her top. Michael takes a picture] All right, let’s head out. Sounds good. Do you have a coat?",2,10,17
Michael," Maybe. The suspense is just so exciting, isn’t it?",2,11,18
Michael," Well, no. But… okay, don’t spoil it for everybody, all right? But we are going on a booze cruise on Lake Wallenpaupack.",2,11,18
Michael, This is not just another party. This is a leadership training exercise. Right? I’m going to combine elements of fun and motivation and education into a single mind-blowing experience.  				,2,11,18
Michael, It is now time to unveil the destination of this year’s retreat. We are going on a harbor cruise of Lake Wallenpaupack. It’s a booze cruise!,2,11,18
Michael," No. This is mandatory. But don’t worry, you know what? You’re gonna learn plenty. This is gonna turn your life around, Ryan.",2,11,18
Michael," Well, just keep the tags on and you can return it.",2,11,18
Michael," Well, that’s not my fault, okay? Just.. we’re not going to pay for a bathing suit. Okay, I know what you’re all thinking, “Who is this smart little cookie?” Her name is Brenda… something, and she is from corporate. And she is here, like you, to learn from what I have to say.  				",2,11,18
Michael," I am a great motivational speaker. I attended a Tony Robbins event by the airport last year, and… it wasn’t the actual course. You have to pay for the actual course. But it talked about the actual course. And I’ve incorporated a lot of his ideas into my own course.  				",2,11,18
Michael," Leader… ship. The word “ship” is hidden inside the word “leadership,” as its derivation. So if this office is, in fact, a ship, as its leader, I am the captain. But we’re all in the same boat. Teamwork!  				",2,11,18
Michael," Now, on this ship that is the office, what is a sales department? Anyone?",2,11,18
Michael," Yes, Darryl, the sales department makes sales. Good. Let me just explain. I see the sales department as the furnace.",2,11,18
Michael," All right, let’s not get hung up on the furnace. This just… it’s the sales… I see the sales department down there. They’re in the engine room, and they are shoveling coal into the furnace, right? I mean, who saw the movie Titanic? They were very important in the movie Titanic. Who saw it? Show of hands!",2,11,18
Michael," No! Thank you, spoiler alert. You saw the movie, those of you who did. They’re happy down there in the furnace room. And they’re dirty and grimy and sweaty, and they’re singing their ethnic songs, and… actually, that might be warehouse.",2,11,18
Michael," The… no, no. No, I didn’t… okay. Well, okay, in a nutshell, what I’m saying is… leadership. We’ll talk more about that on the boat. Ship.",2,11,18
Michael," [singing] A three-hour tour, a three-hour tour.  				",2,11,18
Michael," Pam, you are Mary Ann! We have the Professor and Ginger, welcome aboard. Angela, you are Mrs. Howell. Lovey. [to Kelly] Uh… the native. Sometimes they come from neighboring… [to Stanley] We have one of the Globetrotters, I am the Skipper, and Dwight, you will be Gilligan.",2,11,18
Michael," I’d rather die. Hi, I am Michael Scott, I am the captain of this party.",2,11,18
Michael," In an office, when you are ranking people, manager is higher than captain. On a boat, who knows? It’s nebulose.  				",2,11,18
Michael," Hey, look! I’m king of the world!  				",2,11,18
Michael," And I am the regional manager of Dunder-Mifflin, Michael Scott. Welcome, welcome!",2,11,18
Michael," But don’t worry, you are not going to be needing life preservers tonight.",2,11,18
Michael, I’m your party captain too! And you are gonna put on your dancing shoes later on! So we are gonna… ,2,11,18
Michael," If the boat’s a-rockin’, don’t come knockin’!",2,11,18
Michael, We’re all gonna have a good time tonight!,2,11,18
Michael," Good. Well, that is what Scranton is all about. Not like you New Yawkers.",2,11,18
Michael," Well, we already sort of started it back at the office and on the dock with the Gilligan thing, so… right now, I was thinking. Yes. Okay, listen up all you Dunder-Mifflinites! I would like to talk to you all about life preservers. Now, one important life preserver in business is IT support.",2,11,18
Michael," But before that, I have to do my presentation.",2,11,18
Michael," All right, we’ll have a motivational dance contest! Hit it! Yeah, okay, dancing! It is a primal art form used in ancient times to express yourself with the body and communicate!   				",2,11,18
Michael, Sometimes you have to take a break from being the kind of boss that’s always trying to teach people things. Sometimes you have to just be the boss of dancing.  				,2,11,18
Michael," Ah! See, this is of general interest. It is about priorities and making decisions, using the boat as an analogy. What is important to you? If the boat is sinking, what do you save?",2,11,18
Michael," Okay, well, obviously you don’t know anything about leadership.",2,11,18
Michael," Not what I was looking for, but a good thought.",2,11,18
Michael," I don’t want to take credit for this, but Roy and I were just having a conversation about making commitments and making choices. Right? Did I motivate you?",2,11,18
Michael," Well… could have been either one of us, because we were pretty much saying the same thing.  Congratulations. That is great!",2,11,18
Michael, Yes! I can marry you as regional manager of Dunder-Mifflin!,2,11,18
Michael, Captain Jack is a fart face. I’m on medication.,2,11,18
Michael," Vomicillin. Okay. All right. It’s time to be boss. It’s time to motivate. Let’s blow some minds here. Okay, guys, guys, cool it. Everybody, Dunder-Mifflin Scranton employees, Brenda, I have some very, very urgent news I need to tell everybody right now. Listen up. The ship is sinking! Okay? We’re going down, right now. Just wrap your heads around the reality of that. Shh, please! Everybody, it’s my turn now, okay? Captain Jack is gone. In five minutes, this ship is going to be at the bottom of the lake! And there aren’t enough spaces on the lifeboat! Who are we gonna save? Do we save sales? Do we save customer service? Do we save accounting? This is a business scenario. Right? It’s a scary… it’s a… ",2,11,18
Michael," It’s a predicament, and it’s something that each and every one of us has to think about.  				",2,11,18
Michael," I’m in the brig. See? The boat’s not as corporate-friendly as advertised. What was the deal with the guy jumping overboard? What was… if he had just waited and heard what I had to say, he would be motivated right now and not all wet.  				",2,11,18
Michael, Captain Jack has a problem with authority.,2,11,18
Michael," He just totally lost it. If you ask me, he caused the panic.",2,11,18
Michael," Well, it’s nice for you. Your friend got engaged.",2,11,18
Michael," Really? You’re kidding me. You and Pam? Wow. I would have never have put you two together. You really hid it well. God! I usually have a radar for stuff like that. You know, I made out with Jan… ",2,11,18
Michael," Well, if you like her so much, don’t give up.",2,11,18
Michael, Pam! It’s Michael.  Help me!  I need help right now.,2,12,19
Michael," I’m hurt, I have hurt myself.  Oh my God!",2,12,19
Michael, I want to come to work.  But I need you to come and pick me up. [Jim lunges across Pam’s desk and puts Michael on speakerphone],2,12,19
Michael," OK, buhhhh, I burned my foot very badly on my Foreman Grill and I now need someone to come and bring me into work.",2,12,19
Michael," I enjoy having breakfast in bed.  I like waking up to the smell of bacon, sue me.  And since I don’t have a butler, I have to do it myself.  So, most nights before I go to bed, I will lay six strips of bacon out on my George Foreman Grill.  Then I go to sleep.  When I wake up, I plug in the grill, I go back to sleep again.  Then I wake up to the smell of crackling bacon.  It is delicious, it’s good for me.  It’s the perfect way to start the day.  Today I got up, I stepped onto the grill and it clamped down on my foot… that’s it.  I don’t see what’s so hard to believe about that.  				",2,12,19
Michael," Ok, could someone come and get me please, Ryan?",2,12,19
Michael, There’s no toilet paper here.  Could Ryan… tell Ryan to bring toilet paper.  Could you tell ’em that?,2,12,19
Michael," I tried hopping, Kevin, and I bumped my elbow against the wall and now my elbow has a protruberance. ",2,12,19
Michael, [panicked] No one wants to pick me up!?,2,12,19
Michael, Don’t… is that Dwight?  I do not want Dwight.  ,2,12,19
Michael," It was all made up.  Just someone come, ok?  Anyone.  Anyone but Dwight.",2,12,19
Michael, Hellooo? … Please don’t send Dwight!  				,2,12,19
Michael," Morning everyone.  Don’t freak out. I forbid anybody to freak out.  Clearly, I have had a very serious accident, but I will recover, God willing.  I just want to be treated normally today.  Normal would actually be good, considering the trauma that I’ve been through.",2,12,19
Michael, Please stop popping my cast.  Thank you.,2,12,19
Michael," Really, well, it, uh, seemed very important to you earlier that you needed to stay and… ",2,12,19
Michael," No, your job is being my friend, Pam.  OW! God!",2,12,19
Michael," I don’t want any special treatment, Pam. I just want you to treat me like you would some family member who’s undergone some sort of serious physical trauma.  I don’t think that’s too much to ask.",2,12,19
Michael," No, I don’t want some aspirin, yeah I’m a little fussy.  Aspirin’s not gonna do a damn thing.  I’m sitting here with a bloody stump of a foot.",2,12,19
Michael, What?  Part of your duties are to what?,2,12,19
Michael, You just said “part of your duties are to” something.,2,12,19
Michael, Thank you.  Did you get all dark meat like I like?,2,12,19
Michael, How strange.  Because they always have yams.  				,2,12,19
Michael," Uh, ow.  Ryan! … Ryaaaaan … RYYYYAN!  				",2,12,19
Michael," No, nope, no one is helping me out at all Mom.  No, I’m not gonna call Jan.  She’d just worry… drive down here and make a big thing… Who told you that?  No, it was mutual.  What is Pam doing chatting with you?  				",2,12,19
Michael," [loud noise in bathroom] No! Guh! OW! Awww, help, help me!",2,12,19
Michael, I fell off the toilet.  I’m caught between the toilet and the wall.,2,12,19
Michael, Get Ryan.  He needs to lift me. [Ryan shakes his head] and he needs to clean me up a little bit.  Bring a wet towel.,2,12,19
Michael," Ugh, forget it.  I’ll just get up myself.  No!  Uh, aaaahhh!  Ah!  Oh God!  				",2,12,19
Michael," Can I have everyone’s attention please?  Phyllis, Oscar, Ryan, who’s supposed to be dead, can I ask you all a question?  Do you all know what it’s like to be disabled?  Oscar?",2,12,19
Michael," Wuh, how, how old are you? Look, the point is, I am the only one here who has a legitimate disability, although I’m sure Stanley has had his fair share of obstacles.  ",2,12,19
Michael," Ok, [lifts up cooked foot] what does this look like to you Stanley?!  ",2,12,19
Michael," Shuuut it, ok, well, well you know what, disabilities are not things to be laughed at or laughed about.  You people are jerks.  Imagine if you had left Stevie Wonder on the floor of that bathroom instead of me.",2,12,19
Michael," [sigh] I burned my foot!!!  Ok, twenty minutes, conference room, everybody’s in there!",2,12,19
Michael," While we are waiting for our special guest to arrive, I wanted you all to take a look at a few of the many, many disabled icons who have contributed so much to our society.  ",2,12,19
Michael," Good question.  Forrest Gump: mentally challenged, Philadelphia [points to a picture from Big]:",2,12,19
Michael," He grew into a man overnight.  Rare disability, still works. [sigh] A crossword puzzle Stanley, seriously, are you learning nothing here?",2,12,19
Michael," This, ladies and gentlemen, is our special guest.",2,12,19
Michael, But it’s hard for you! Right? Because you’re in a wheelchair.,2,12,19
Michael," Let me ask you something, how long does it take for you to do something simple, every day, like brush your teeth in the morning?",2,12,19
Michael," Oh my God, that’s three times as long as it takes me.",2,12,19
Michael," Well, that’s good, he still has a sense of humor.",2,12,19
Michael," Well they notice it.  Don’t you?  You notice it.  It’s the first thing you saw when he rolled in here, isn’t it?  				",2,12,19
Michael," Ignore him.  You know what?  We’re not that different, you and I.  When I clamped my foot into a non-stick… ",2,12,19
Michael, Did you see Born on the Fourth of July?  I was under the impression that Billy would be more like that guy.  				,2,12,19
Michael," You did it!  Look at you, and with the plate and the napkin.  Very nice.  Thank you, Ryan.",2,12,19
Michael, You know what?  I feel better.  Ryan brought me some chocolate pudding and his kindness healed my foot.  				,2,12,19
Michael," Yeah, baby, I am feelin’ better.  My body’s literally healing itself.  It is amazing what the human body is capable of when you have a powerful brain.    				",2,12,19
Michael," Uh, finally feel the blood coursing through my foot veins.",2,12,19
Michael," Oh, now you feel some compassion for him.",2,12,19
Michael," I can’t take you, I don’t have my car and yours is all vomity.",2,12,19
Michael," Oh, ok, that’s, great.  No, I can’t drive.  Jim why don’t you drive.",2,12,19
Michael," We’ll go.  I’m still recovering. So let’s just, Ryan, could you get my coat please.",2,12,19
Michael, The rules of shotgun are very simple and very clear.  The first person to shout “shotgun” when you’re within the sight of the car gets the front seat.  That’s how  the game’s played.  There are no exceptions for someone with a concussion.    				,2,12,19
Michael," Oh, God, a mini-van.  What is Meredith’s problem?",2,12,19
Michael," Well, yeah she has one kid, no husband.  She’s not gonna find one driving this thing around.",2,12,19
Michael," Chuck E. Cheese?  Oh, God, I’m so sick of Chuck E. Cheese.",2,12,19
Michael, Dwight… [to Jim] You just keep your eyes on the road. [to Dwight]  Give me the bottle or you’re fired.,2,12,19
Michael," Stop, stop it! Stop spraying! [Dwight whines] Gimme the bottle!",2,12,19
Michael, What do I write under “reason for visit”?,2,12,19
Michael, Nothing.  I wrote “bringing someone to the hospital”.,2,12,19
Michael," No… you know what Jim, this isn’t about me anymore.  I made a miraculous recovery, which is more than I can say for him. [Dwight falls towards Jim]",2,12,19
Michael," Doctor, what is more serious, a head injury or a foot injury?",2,12,19
Michael," Well, you don’t have all the information. The foot as been fairly severely burned and healed quickly, very quickly, actually like suspiciously quickly.",2,12,19
Michael," Look since you have the machine up and running, can I just stick my foot, we take a look?",2,12,19
Michael," Alright, well, I guess this is where we leave you off.",2,12,19
Michael," Uh, well you should of thought of before you crashed your head on your way to pick me up.  We’ll, see you when you get out.",2,12,19
Michael," Ah, ah, ah, what? What? Where’s the funny? Give it to me.",2,13,20
Michael," Oh, oh, wow! I walked right into that. Oh, that’s brilliant!  				",2,13,20
Michael," Hey, Stanley, is that jacket make of up-dog?",2,13,20
Michael," Mmm, what flavour coffee is that?  Up-dog?",2,13,20
Michael," I don’t know, nothin’, what’s up with you?",2,13,20
Michael, Dwight! Hey is it me or does this place smell like up-dog?,2,13,20
Michael," Gotcha! [laughing] Oh, God. [low] Crap! Nothin’ how ya doing?",2,13,20
Michael," Today is spring cleaning day here at Dunder Mifflin. And yes I know its January. I am not an idiot. But, if you do your Spring cleaning in January; guess what you don’t have to do in the spring?  Anything.  They say a cluttered desk means a cluttered mind.  Well I say that an empty desk means a… ",2,13,20
Michael," No, that’s not… no, that’s not what I was going to say.  				",2,13,20
Michael, What difference does it make whether your here?,2,13,20
Michael," Yechh, yeah, um, heard you were under the weather?",2,13,20
Michael," Really? Oh, that is a shame.  You know it’s cleaning day here today? Could have used some of that famous Hispanic cleaning ethic.",2,13,20
Michael, I need you to go back to bed. I need you to get better. See you Monday.  Unless you’re still sick.  So have a great long weekend.,2,13,20
Michael, Yeah. Drop what you’re doing. Make this a priority. Because an office can’t function efficiently unless people are at their desks doing their jobs.  				,2,13,20
Michael," Wowweee. Mikey likey. Why don’t you wear your hair like that all the time.  It’s much sexier. [Pam puts hair back up] [Michael walks by Jim] Man, this must be torture for you.  				",2,13,20
Michael," Jim and I are great friends. We hang out a ton, mostly at work. But, the fact that he told me his secret and no one else knows says everything about our friendship.  And it is why, I intend on keeping that secret for as long as I possibly can.  				",2,13,20
Michael, My lips are sealed. [singing] My lips are sealed… Bangles.,2,13,20
Michael," [singing] Can you hear me, they talk about us…   				",2,13,20
Michael," Ah, good stuff, good stuff. Did you see the game last night?",2,13,20
Michael," Any of em?  So, uh, what’s the 411? Any news on the “P” situation?",2,13,20
Michael, Listen Stanley. How long does it take you to pick out a soda?,2,13,20
Michael," Alright, well, cool. [Michael walks by Jim] Still deciding?",2,13,20
Michael, [Michael presses a button for Stanley] Peach iced tea. You’re going to hate it.  				,2,13,20
Michael, Fact: I love grape soda. I always have. Fact: Jim and I talk all the time. We tell each other secrets.,2,13,20
Michael," Um, I don’t know, yeah, yeah, yeah it is.",2,13,20
Michael," Whooo, nice. That was, that was slick.  What are you doin’ for lunch?",2,13,20
Michael," Oh nonsense [lifts leg and puts it on Jim’s desk], no way, no. Why don’t, why don’t I take you out to lunch? My treat.",2,13,20
Michael, Hey you know what we could do? We could spread out a blanket in the break room.  Have a little picnic order some ‘za. Talk about you know who.,2,13,20
Michael," [at Hooters] Oh man, you should order milk. Get it?   				",2,13,20
Michael," Why do I like Hooters? Well I will give you two reasons, the boobs and the hot wings.  				",2,13,20
Michael," Oh, here we go, here we go. Bogy at 3 o’clock. Hi.",2,13,20
Michael," We’re not worthy. We’re not worthy. Hello Dana, I am Michael and this is Jim and we are brothers.",2,13,20
Michael, I’m his boss actually.  And I treat him well. I’m taking him out to lunch cause I can afford it and he can have whatever he wants.,2,13,20
Michael," Tell me Dana, how is your chicken breast?",2,13,20
Michael," Mmmm, sounds yummy.  I will have a chicken breast hold the chicken. [Giggles]",2,13,20
Michael," No, I’m gonna have the gourmet hot dog.",2,13,20
Michael, Just go to his house and see if he’s sick. I could have done this Investigation in like twenty minutes.,2,13,20
Michael, [Michael messes up hair to look like Jim’s] Expenses.,2,13,20
Michael, No. It’s… I wear it like that sometimes. Is that a wig?,2,13,20
Michael, No he did not. I don’t need his permission.,2,13,20
Michael," Uhhh it’s ridiculous. They took my card away because I spent $80 bucks at a magic shop. What they don’t understand is that I bought the stuff to impress potential clients. So business related, right?  				",2,13,20
Michael, I put a cigarette through a freakin’ quarter.  And you know what Toby? They almost bought from us.,2,13,20
Michael," Look Jim needed a relaxing lunch, he has been depressed and it has been affecting his productivity.  How is that not work related?",2,13,20
Michael," You’re not his friend, you don’t know. He is in love with a girl he works with who’s engaged.  So just cut me some slack. Please?",2,13,20
Michael," You know what Kevin? Jim is a friend of mine, so the only people that this crush really concerns is Jim and Pam… and me.  				",2,13,20
Michael," I, oh, just, um, I know I was trying to, expense reports. And then God, Toby, you know he just… I know. I’m just, I just hope that, I just hope that [starts to get choked up] this doesn’t affect our friendship! Stupid, this is so stupid.",2,13,20
Michael," Ok, I’m fine, no I know, I’m good, I’m good, it’s just.",2,13,20
Michael," Yeah I’m fine. Look, about you and Jim.",2,13,20
Michael," No, I feel it’s my responsibility as your boss slash friend.",2,13,20
Michael, It wasn’t that long ago. It was on the booze cruise.,2,13,20
Michael," Yehhh, okay, shuuttt it Michael. I’m done. That’s it. I’m out.  				",2,13,20
Michael," People are always coming to me. “Michael, I have a secret.  Your the only one I trust.” No thanks, because keeping a secret can only lead to trouble. Like I was watching Cinemax last weekend.  This movie, Portrait of a… Prostitute something. Secrets of a Call… More Secrets of a Call Girl. And the lead character, Shila, is framed for murder. She goes on the run and winds up working at a bordello in Malibu. I don’t, I don’t want to live like that. I like it here. I don’t want to be Shila, I like being Michael Scott.  				",2,13,20
Michael," I am Pam.  Spicoli guy.  Oh, God.  Names, numbers.  Okay. [walking into office] Whoa!  God!  Yuck, yuck.  Yuck.  Yuck!",2,14,21
Michael," There is stink in there, my God!  What is… what is that?",2,14,21
Michael," Oh, God!  How could that happen?  How could… right in the middle of the carpet.",2,14,21
Michael," Um, somebody vomited right in the middle of the carpet in my office. ",2,14,21
Michael," Check it out.  Don’t be a wuss, just get… no, I’m not holding your coffee.  ",2,14,21
Michael," What is it?  No, just tell me what it is. ",2,14,21
Michael, I cannot believe a pipe burst and left that in there.,2,14,21
Michael," How do you know that?  What is it, then? ",2,14,21
Michael, [as cleaning lady with mask leaves] Here she comes.  All cleaned?  Great. [walks into office],2,14,21
Michael," [while in his reeking office]  I am a big Fear Factor fan.  I’m a big fan of anything Joe Rogan does, actually, so this is sort of like my audition tape.  Um… [clearing throat]   I can’t stand it [gets up to leave], I can’t stay in here another second.  No!  					",2,14,21
Michael, [sitting at Jim’s desk]  Hey Jim.  I thought that we would be desk buddies while they changed my carpet.,2,14,21
Michael," No, no, no!  Seriously, I don’t mind sharing. ",2,14,21
Michael," [putting his feet on desk] Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Old bullpen.",2,14,21
Michael," I just… you couldn’t understand, but man, you guys have it so easy out here, you know?  I used to sit right here.",2,14,21
Michael," Ed Truck. [exclaiming is disgust]  Ed Truck was the manager before me.  Horrible.  He hated fun.  It was like, “Oh, Ed Truck is walking toward us.  Stop having fun.  Start pretending to do work.”  What a jerk.  He’s… You know what?  I swore to myself that if I ever got to walk around the room as manager, people would laugh when they saw me coming and would applaud as I walked away.   					",2,14,21
Michael, You know who used to sit at that desk? ,2,14,21
Michael," He was, but, uh… that desk was empty.  He’d come in and sit there sometimes.",2,14,21
Michael," When I was in training, many years ago… not so long ago… I worked side-by-side with a fellow named Todd Packer, and together we rocked the office [picture behind Michael falls].  Packer and I once spent the whole day with our pants off, and when people noticed, we convinced them that ",2,14,21
Michael, I will gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today. ,2,14,21
Michael," Oh, a customer, well, sound the alarm. [laughs] Okay.  					",2,14,21
Michael," Another time, Packer held this guy’s head in the toilet for like a minute.  Guy had no sense of humor about it.  Probably why he wasn’t hired.   					",2,14,21
Michael," Once, as a joke, Packer banged every chick in the office. [giggles]  It was hysterical.   					",2,14,21
Michael, Old fashioned raid.  Sales on Accounting.  Yeah.  Follow my lead.  					,2,14,21
Michael," No, no, no, no.  We don’t do that.  We don’t do that. ",2,14,21
Michael," Why would somebody ruin a perfectly good carpet?  I don’t know.  It could be done out of hate.  It could be done out of love.  It could be completely neutral.  Maybe somebody hates the cleaning lady.  And, well, she doesn’t do a very good job, obviously, because my office still reeks like you would not believe.  I hate her.   					",2,14,21
Michael, You know what?  I am beginning to think that what happened to my carpet was an act of terrorism against the office.  The only thing that makes any sense.  					,2,14,21
Michael, Stop it. [Dwight hangs up] Stop.  It.  [Dwight beings to dial] Don’t.  Don’t.  ,2,14,21
Michael," Oh, and I’m not?  Why would you say that? Because I’m having fun?  You guys just are workin’ for the weekend, aren’t you?  I’m workin’ for the week.  Sales team, listen to me.  This is what we’re gonna do.  I’m gonna up the ante a little bit literally.  Right here, I’m gonna put a crisp one hundred dollar bill.  The person with the most sales at the end of the day gets to keep the cash.  Sound good?  ",2,14,21
Michael," [counting cash] Seventy, eighty, one, two three.  Eighty-three dollars.  Still a lotta money and I’m going to … [moves money after seeing workmen walk by] … I’m gonna leave it right over here where everybody can see it.  I will be taking Jim’s clients today because he is not here and out of sight, out of the contest.  Let’s see who winds up with the cash, shall we?  ",2,14,21
Michael," [on phone] So you have 40 boxes going out, and I will deliver those personally in a Sebring.  Very good, nice doing business with you.  Thank you. [hangs up] Yes! [chuckles] Oh, yeah!  Read it and weep.  Oh!  Oh, look at that! [puts post-it on Phyllis’ forehead]  Look at me, Phyllis!  Oh, what is that?  That’s my sale! [humming then dancing victoriously]",2,14,21
Michael," You know what, guys?  It’s none of your concern.  It was official business, so just…",2,14,21
Michael," Extreme Home Makeover puts together a house in an hour.  If you were on that crew, you would be fired like that. [snaps]  					",2,14,21
Michael, This was no act of God.  A person did this.  A person who works in this office.  Maybe all of them.    					,2,14,21
Michael, You know what?  Today is not a good day for a sales contest.  We’re… we’re not… we’re not doin’ this today.  ,2,14,21
Michael," You wanna talk about fair?  Does anyone need to smell my old carpet?  You explain to me how that was fair, and I’ll explain to you how this is fair.  Plus I just… I think that picking today was sort of taking advantage.  ",2,14,21
Michael, I am a victim of a hate crime.  Stanley knows what I’m talkin’ about.,2,14,21
Michael," Well I hated it!  A lot!  Okay, I… you know what?  If the guilty person would just come forward and take their punishment, we’d be done . [no one comes forward]  Very well.  Then you are all punished.  ",2,14,21
Michael," You’re all on a time out.  Just sit there quietly. [phone rings, Phyllis reaches to answer]  No.  NO!  [phone continues to ring]  					",2,14,21
Michael," [sighs]  I wasn’t talking literally, Creed.  Yeah, being buried alive would be worse. Happy?  Why am I talking to you?   					",2,14,21
Michael, [meeting Ed Truck in parking lot] Ed?  Hi.  Thanks for meeting me.  Must be kinda neat comin’ back.,2,14,21
Michael," Uh, well, honestly Ed, I really don’t wanna be up there right now.  ",2,14,21
Michael," Oh, no, no, no.  You’re good.  It was clerical.  You’re good.  Um, well, somebody did something in my office, and I now think that they did it on purpose and it was directed at me.",2,14,21
Michael," I didn’t get a good look at… it, but it smells horrible.",2,14,21
Michael," Well, that figures.  So how did you deal with people not liking you?",2,14,21
Michael, Not necessarily.  You can love a boss like you do a father.,2,14,21
Michael," Well, okay.  Different management styles.",2,14,21
Michael," Last week I would have given a kidney to anyone in this office.  I would have reached right into my stomach and pulled it out for them.  But now, no.  I don’t have the relationship with these people that I thought I did.  I hope they ask, so they can hear me say, “Uh… no. I only give my organs to my real friends.  Go get yourself a monkey kidney.”  					",2,14,21
Michael, Who is this?  How did you get this number? ,2,14,21
Michael, Oh my God.  Packer.  Packster.  Whacky Pack.  How you doin’?  ,2,14,21
Michael, Uh… no.  Did anybody see a package here today?  No.  How big was it?,2,14,21
Michael, Did you see a big package?  Where did you leave it? ,2,14,21
Michael," Really?  Guys, did you see a big package in my office?",2,14,21
Michael," That was Packer!  Oh, you’re… you are dead.  You are dead, my friend!  That is hilar… Oh, God!  Of course it was you. ",2,14,21
Michael," Oh.  [laughs and claps] Yeah, yeah!  Oh my God.  It was Packer!  					",2,14,21
Michael," It takes an advanced sense of humor.  I don’t expect everybody to understand.  It was done out of love, just like I thought.  It’s ah… God, these people are so… these are good people.  We have fun. [giggles] We just have fun!  Oh, I’m just so sorry that I threw the thing out.   					",2,14,21
Michael, Yeah… I… You know what… I… I… I just thought about it. I just have a few things I want to say.,2,15,22
Michael," Hold… Just hear me out. What is more important than Quality? E-Quality. Now studies show that today’s woman, the Ally McBeal woman, as I call her, is at a crossroads… ",2,15,22
Michael," No, just uh… you have come a long way, baby.  But I just… just want to keep it within reason.",2,15,22
Michael, And they ended up turning the break room into a lactation room which is disgusting so… ,2,15,22
Michael, [stands up] Anybody want any coffee or…,2,15,22
Michael," Women in the workplace… yeah, translation “I have been banned from my own conference room so that Jan can talk in secret to all the girls.” Oh! Sorry. ‘Women of the workplace.’ About what? I don’t know. Clothes. Me. Eeegkh!  				",2,15,22
Michael," Everyone. Guys. Circle up, please. Come on over. Bring your chairs. Toby, come on over. You’re a guy… too… sort of. Let’s do this!  				",2,15,22
Michael," [in the background] Well, first of all, I, uh, just want to warm up a little bit. Let’s just clap.  				",2,15,22
Michael, Let’s just clap. Ready? [clapping] Yeah! Yeah!,2,15,22
Michael, Just having a little ‘guys in the workplace’ thing.,2,15,22
Michael, Why can’t boys play with dolls? Why does society force us to use urinals when sitting down is far more comfortable?,2,15,22
Michael," OK, OK, Fine. Yeah, actually, perfect. Perfect. You know what? There’s another side to this place, gentleman. And I know we all love our cushy jobs and our fun, exciting office. But do you realize that underneath us, there’s another world. The warehouse world. A world that is teeming with sweat and dirt and life. Life. The bowels of the office. These guys are down there, they are real men doing real man’s work. We are going to learn how a warehouse works.  				",2,15,22
Michael," Oh, I think it’s going to work out great. Because managing the warehouse is a very important part of my job. And I haven’t been there in months.  				",2,15,22
Michael," So let’s meet the warehouse! Let’s get some shots. Pan around there. This is Darryl, one of our warehouse staff. Darryl, what is your biggest fear?",2,15,22
Michael," You know, Darryl is actually the Foreman here and not Roy, which is cool. There’s Roy riding the big rig. So Roy is actually going to be marrying Pam sometime this summer. And… uh, she’s our receptionist. Sort of a Brangelina thing.",2,15,22
Michael, Brangelina is the Brad Pitt and Angelina… Roy… ,2,15,22
Michael, Roy and Pam. It’s a Ram. It’s a Ram thing.,2,15,22
Michael, [points at math equasion on chalkboard] Uhhuhhuh. Just in case there’s someone down here who shouldn’t be. A little “Good Will Hunting” situation. All right. Troops. This is an important day. Big day. Now you may look around and see two groups here. White collar. Blue collar. But I don’t see it that way. And you know why not? Because I am collar-blind.  				,2,15,22
Michael," Oh… well… okay… yeah, you know what? I don’t think… You.. You’re… My job sucks compared to this. I don’t think you’d like it up there.",2,15,22
Michael, Guys! Want to start unloading the truck?  				,2,15,22
Michael, Check this out! Look at that! Look at that [squeezes blow-up doll] bwup-bwa! [talks in girly voice] Hello! How are… [regular voice] Oh! Kay. That is great. That is good stuff.  				,2,15,22
Michael," Hey, you’re going to, going to hurt yourself.",2,15,22
Michael," Oh, oh, oh!  We’ll get somebody to clean that up.",2,15,22
Michael, We ought to have this thing serviced.  				,2,15,22
Michael," So! Guy’s gripe session. Here we are. Now, we definitely live in different worlds but we have a lot in common. We even like the same girls, some of us. That’s going to happen, you know. We’re guys, so… ",2,15,22
Michael," Let’s start with the Warehouse. What bothers you as guys, you know?",2,15,22
Michael," I hate shushing. You know, that’s the thing! What the… ok… what is our beef as human men.",2,15,22
Michael, OK. Alright. Good. Guys ragging on each other. That’s what guys do… and we love it.  				,2,15,22
Michael, You know what? Is that necessary? Because you already sorta have a union… of guys.,2,15,22
Michael, Yeah. You know what? I think the problem is the chicks.,2,15,22
Michael, The problem is the chicks. And you gotta blame them.,2,15,22
Michael," [knocks] This is important. Ladies, take a breather. Jan, I uh wanna… Can I help you? Um… I wanted to say that the guys downstairs are thinking about forming a union. And they have some good points… ",2,15,22
Michael, Part of my job is knowing how to talk to women.  				,2,15,22
Michael, Let’s… be… rational… here. What are the pros? What are the cons?,2,15,22
Michael, Don’t talk to me that way please. Just… they’re going to want to hear this from you.,2,15,22
Michael, I mean I just don’t want to have to tell them something they’re not going to want to hear.,2,15,22
Michael, Ok. Come on Jan. After all we’ve been through… ,2,15,22
Michael, I’m just saying we have something… Ok. Whatever.  				,2,15,22
Michael," Cold front coming into the Warehouse. Uh oh! Better put on your ski boots! Woohoohoowoo. Waaaah! Happy New Year, Darryl! Hey,Darryl. You ever done this?  				",2,15,22
Michael, I have essentially. Yes. I’ve taken some… ,2,15,22
Michael, Pizza. Great equalizer. Rich people love pizza.  Poor people love pizza.  White people love pizza.  Black people love pizza.  Do black people like pizza?  				,2,15,22
Michael," Hey. Um… look guys, I’m sorry. Sometimes Jan can be such a bitch.",2,15,22
Michael," Hey, watch it, watch it. We have a relationship.  				",2,15,22
Michael, Is it good to be back. Yeah. I mean I love the guy stuff but to run an office you need men and women. You know why? Because you need to have that crazy sexual tension to keep things interesting.  				,2,15,22
Michael," Alright Dwight, as you know I am heading to New York today. [Dwight holds up passport.] Doing a presentation on the branch to the new CFO.",2,16,23
Michael," This is a business trip. I would have to be a raving lunatic to try to talk to Jan about what happened between us. Her words, not mine. She sent me an email this morning. But, it is Valentine’s Day. It’s New York. City of Love.   				",2,16,23
Michael," Hey, Pam. You heart N.Y., right? You want me to pick you up anything? ",2,16,23
Michael," Dude, I’m gonna nail it. Me in New York? Oh, I own that city. Fuggedaboudit! See ya!  				",2,16,23
Michael," Well here we go. On our way to New York. New York, New York. City so nice they named it twice. Manhattan is the other name.   				",2,16,23
Michael," The meeting isn’t ’til three, but I always like to come to New York little bit early and hit some of my favorite hunts, like right here, is my favorite New York pizza joint. And I’m gonna go get me a New York slice. [Michael walks toward Sbarro.]  				",2,16,23
Michael," Here it is, heart of New York City, Times Square. Named for the good times you have when you’re in it. Most people when they come to New York, they go straight to the Empire State Building, that’s pretty touristy. I come here. Great places to eat. [points] We have Bubba Gump Shrimp, Red Lobster down there. Ya know. This is, this is the heart of civilization, right here.   				",2,16,23
Michael," Everybody takes the subway in New York. It’s fast, it’s efficient, gets you there on time. It’s a way to [turns and rushes back up stairs] Okay, there’s a guy pooping in a cardboard box down there.   				",2,16,23
Michael," This is the world famous Rockefeller Center. Founded, of course by Theodore Rockefeller. This is a skating rink and I think the Rangers practice there sometimes and it’s, that’s Tina Fey [points]. That’s Tina Fey from Saturday Night Live. Hello? Hello, hi? [walks over] OH, I’m sorry, I thought you were [Conan O’Brien walks in front of Michael], OK, I thought that was. She, she looked a lot like Tina Fey. [to camera] Hello, hello, I thought that was Tina Fey, but it wasn’t. So… Are you serious? He was here? When, when I was talking to the fake Tina Fey? Come on! And are you, argh.  				",2,16,23
Michael," I would love to live in New York someday. It’s a big dream of mine. Work for corporate, with Jan. It’d be awesome. Go to Broadway shows, eat hot dogs. Scranton is great, but New York, is like Scranton on acid, no on speed, no on steroids. [Michael sees it’s the end of a street.] OK, umm, I think, that’s either the Hudson or the East, so we’re back,  should be back this way. There’s a lotta pressure on me right now. It’s like Michael Jordan, in the NBA finals. Or, like Stormin’ Norman Schwarzkopf, and this presentation is desert storm and as soon as it’s over, we will not have to deal with those Iraqis anymore. Let’s do it.   				",2,16,23
Michael," Josh Porter, high five. [They high five] Bam.",2,16,23
Michael," Yeah, how ya doing? Nobody needs to introduce this guy. Craiggers. [bump fists]",2,16,23
Michael," You have been kicked out of every strip club in Albany, is that true?",2,16,23
Michael," Cool. Good, good, good. Give us some time to catch up, and… [awkward silence]  				",2,16,23
Michael," Ay, Kay. Come on, you know, that’s not. Cool it.",2,16,23
Michael," Maybe because she’s my girlfriend. [starts retracting statement] Was, or not my girlfriend. She’s… we hooked up and…",2,16,23
Michael," You know, months ago, just once, It’s, just stupid. Just forget it, ",2,16,23
Michael," What is a business? Is it a collection of numbers and sales reports? Sure. But as you know, David and Jan, it is much more. [plays video on screen. David and Jan have confused looks on their faces.]",2,16,23
Michael,"  Life moves a little slower in Scranton, Pennsylvania. And that’s the way we like it. Because at Dunder Mifflin Scranton, we’re not just in the paper business, we’re in the people business. Let’s meet some of the folks that make the Scranton branch so special.  This is Stanley Hudson, one of our talented salesman. An African-American father of two, Stanley’s dedication is no doubt one of the hallmark’s of the foundation of the business we’re hoping to build our bases on.   				",2,16,23
Michael," Yeah, I shot a bunch of footage around the office, edited it together on my Mac. I was thinking of entering it into some festivals. Probably won’t. You know, not what this is about.  				",2,16,23
Michael,"  And finally, Pam Beesly. Look at her. Look how cute. Not bad at all. As the receptionist, Pam is truly the gateway to our world. Well, I hope this gave you a little taste of what life is like here at Dunder Mifflin, Scranton. What it’s like to walk a mile in Oscar’s shoes. Or try on Phyllis’ pants.  Maybe even one of Angela’s famous brownies. And you’ll know, that you’re home. ",2,16,23
Michael," Yes, absolutely David. Get that for you. I umm… [hands over report]   				",2,16,23
Michael," Technically, we fell asleep in the same bed. So…",2,16,23
Michael, Yes. I’m sorry. I will fix this. I’ll talk to him. I’ll talk to David.,2,16,23
Michael, I am serious. And don’t call me Shirley. Airplane.   				,2,16,23
Michael," No no no no no, yes I, OK, well, alright, here’s the deal. It’s my fault. This is, this is totally on me. Before you guys came in, I was talking to the guys. We were all chatting and I made a joke, a really dumb joke and Craig the idiot took it seriously. [Jan looks at Michael]",2,16,23
Michael," I did, it was stupid. And Craig, you saw him, he’s not the sharpest tool in the shed. Although he is a tool. [David grins]",2,16,23
Michael," I know. It was borderline at best and… And Jan is a fantastic executive and has all the integrity in the world and um, I’m really sorry. It will never happen again. ",2,16,23
Michael," Yeah, Happy Valentine’s Day. [Jan turns and then kisses Michael. Michael looks and sees camera, Jan turns and sees camera, too. Elevator door closes.]",2,16,23
Michael, Oy vey… schmear. [Points at Fiddler on the Roof playing at Minskoff Theatre and does a dance.]  				,2,16,23
Michael, Could go either way. We don’t know what they are going to say.,2,17,24
Michael, Have to think it through. Because if they say no…,2,17,24
Michael," No! Yes, we have to! You know why? Because I don’t like to be cooped up in that office! In that box! All day long. [Michael starts playing with a football in the office] Heisman! Because I need to think. Okay, Jim? Oh, Kevin, oh! [laughs] Nice catch. Mmmm, mmm, mmm,mmm. Os-car! Intercepted. ",2,17,24
Michael," Give it to me. Phyllis, give me the ball. Ok, give me the ball. Give me, you guys… Creed give me the ball! Right now give it to me.",2,17,24
Michael, Grapes. Seductive. So you ready for the big speech this afternoon?,2,17,24
Michael," Oh! Abso-fruit-ly. Fruit. Grapes. Nailed the joke. Matter of time. Um… And yes, it is a big speech. Biggest of your life.  					",2,17,24
Michael," Speaker at the Sales Convention. Been there, done that. Went there again, did it again. Two years in a row. Consecutive. I just… I miss the feeling of knowing that you did a good job because someone gives you proof of it. Sir, you’re awesome! Here’s a plaque. What, a whole year has gone by and you need more proof? Here’s a certificate. They stopped making plaques that year.  					",2,17,24
Michael, That would look terrible. These are mostly salesmen and salesmen expect to be entertained and you are the main act.  					,2,17,24
Michael," That’s because you’re incapable of doing it because you don’t know how. Because you have no skills. Dwight, there’s no way I can possibly teach you what you need to know about public speaking by speech time.",2,17,24
Michael, But I can teach you enough so that you don’t embarrass me or the company.,2,17,24
Michael," Well, if you have a question, you should ask me.",2,17,24
Michael, Don’t. Don’t try and think of a question to humor me. Just… try not to be such an idiot.,2,17,24
Michael," [stand up comic voice] But seriously, what’s the difference between a salesman and a saleswoman?",2,17,24
Michael," It’s a joke, Dwight. It’s not a Sex Ed class.",2,17,24
Michael," Yeah, you’re right about the difference between a man and a woman, but not about the punch line to the joke, right? [stand up comic voice] The difference between a salesman and a saleswoman… is boobs!",2,17,24
Michael," No, no! They would remember them. Look, it doesn’t matter what you say. It just matters that you’re saying something that people care about. Yeah? All right? Here we go. Watch this.   					",2,17,24
Michael, Attention everybody! Attention please! I have some very great news from Corporate. We had a wonderful quarter and as a result all of you are getting bonuses for 1000 dollars!,2,17,24
Michael, [generalized clapping and cheering] Congratulations.,2,17,24
Michael," You see that? You see how they responded to me? In that moment, I had them.",2,17,24
Michael," No, no! It’s not true. I was just talking so just go out there and say anything. They’ll eat it up. They’re a great audience.  					",2,17,24
Michael, He’s kidding. Dwight was kidding and I don’t know why because it wasn’t funny… and it was just horrible. ,2,17,24
Michael, All right. Everybody in the conference room now. Let’s go. Let’s do it.,2,17,24
Michael," As your leader and your friend, I sort of demand that you can all speak in public as I can… and did… twice. [speaking to camera] You saw the plaque, right? [to office] All right. We’re all going to go around the room and we’re going to make toasts. And that way, we will overcome our fear of public speaking.",2,17,24
Michael," Pam! I’m public speaking. Stop public interrupting me. Actually, this would be good practice for your wedding toast.",2,17,24
Michael, Oh ho hokay. You know what? That’s not a toast. You’re not standing up.,2,17,24
Michael," Okay, Dwight. Show us what you have learned today.",2,17,24
Michael, Dwight is not going to do a job. It’s sad. And they’re expecting excellence because I did do such a good job. Two years in a row. I killed. It was amazing.  					,2,17,24
Michael," It’s time, Dwight. The grim reaper is here.",2,17,24
Michael, All right. You ready? Here we go! Wow. It’s a little bit bigger than I remember. Come on. We’re down here. Right.  					,2,17,24
Michael, All right. You know what? Okay. No. No problem. You are lucky you have me here. I’m going to cover for you. [shouts] All right!,2,17,24
Michael," Gooood morning, Vietnaaaam! I am not Dwight Schrute. Not at all. I am Michael Scott, his mentor and boss. And until Dwight comes up, if he ever does, I wanted to say a few words about excellence. What makes a work environment excellent? Well, there are many things, I believe, that do such a thing of that nature. And one would be humor. What is the difference between a salesman and a saleswoman?   					",2,17,24
Michael," I’m very sorry. I did not know you were wearing a hearing aid and I just thought you were speaking abnormally. …And now the black guy from the ‘Police Academy’ movies. A robot. [makes robot sounds] Michael Winslow, anyone?  					",2,17,24
Michael," Car starting. [makes car sounds]  All right, Dwight Schrute everyone. ",2,17,24
Michael, You would not believe what happened here.,2,17,24
Michael," Oh! This woman came in, sat down, ordered a drink. The bartender asked for her ID which I thought was odd because I pegged her at like 35.",2,17,24
Michael," Yeah, it was weird. So, she was like ‘I don’t have my ID, please give me one.’ And he was like ‘I can’t do that. I can’t serve you.’",2,17,24
Michael, She might have been. So she says ‘Fine. I will go to my room. I will get my purse. I will come back. I’ll show you my ID.’ She hasn’t come back yet. She’s probably in her room drinking from the mini-bar! Right?  					,2,17,24
Michael," Dwight gave a great speech. That’s the word on the street anyway. And I entertained Dwight to no end with my bar stories. So, I captivated the guy who captivated a thousand guys. Can you believe that? A thousand guys?   					",2,17,24
Michael, Pam. Ms. Beasley if yer nastay! Janet Jackson. Hey! You having a wardrobe malfunction there? Or w—,2,18,25
Michael," Listen, I like kids. But this is not a kid’s environment. This is like HBO, no limits. Who knows what I’m going to say? Crazy stuff. And it is R rated, it is not rated G. I am like Eddie Murphy in “Raw,” and they are trying to make me into Eddie Murphy in “Daddy Daycare.” both great movies, but, still.   					",2,18,25
Michael," Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine. Hi, children. I’m Michael Scott, and… I… am in charge of this place… ahh, what’ll make you… understand… I am… like Superman, and the people who work here are like citizens of Gotham City. ",2,18,25
Michael," Okay, I’m Aquaman. Where does he live, guys?",2,18,25
Michael, [under his breath] I work with a bunch of nerds.  					,2,18,25
Michael," Oh, yes, hello, how are you? Good to see you. Wow, you’ve really grown up. You know what? Don’t mind me saying so, she is turning into a stone cold fox. Better keep the… frat boys away from her. ",2,18,25
Michael," Yeah, middle school’s amazing. It is extraordinary. An extraordinary time.  					",2,18,25
Michael," It’s not that children make me uncomfortable, it’s just that, why be a dad when you can be a fun uncle? I’ve never heard of anyone rebelling against their fun uncle.  					",2,18,25
Michael, [while Jake is throwing things at Michael] They want how many spiral pads?,2,18,25
Michael," [on phone] Just compare last year’s order to this year’s. Uh-huh. Yeah, I’m looking at it right now. [Sasha walks in the door] … Yes. We–yeah, they’re very–they’re different. [Sasha walks out] Yeah, we can stick with last year’s, you’re just going to have to supplement it, somehow.   					",2,18,25
Michael," [on phone] Yes. Well… we can… [Sasha walks in, begins playing with Michael’s toy train] uhm… hey, uh, you know what? Can I call you back? I’ll call you right back. Yes, I promise. …Hello, can I help you? … You can pick that up, if you want. That’s— that’s alright. [Sasha moves the train to Michael’s desk] Want to bring it over… here, make some room. My name’s Michael. What’s your name?",2,18,25
Michael," Oh, you know what that is! That is a train whistle, like I’m the conductor. [blows into whistle] But I’m sort of the conductor of the office here, right? [blows into whistle] You want to try?",2,18,25
Michael," All aboard for sales! Next stop, Cu…camonga! [Sasha and Michael laugh]  					",2,18,25
Michael, What the hell are you reading to them? ,2,18,25
Michael," Yeah, you know what? No, no no no no. They, no. The kids don’t want to hear some wierdo book that your Nazi war criminal grandmother gave you. ",2,18,25
Michael," Don’t! Don’t! Don’t talk about Nazis in front of— you know what? They’re going to have nightmares, so why don’t you just shut it? ",2,18,25
Michael, [sighing] Why don’t you just leave? Okay? ,2,18,25
Michael," Alright. There goes Mister Poop. Now, who likes Dane Cook? ",2,18,25
Michael," Children cannot lie. They are innocent, and they speak the truth, and out of the mouths of babes, Michael Scott is freaking cool. [cracks up]  					",2,18,25
Michael," This is where the magic happens! Right over here, let me show you this. See all these? [pets shelf of paper] You know what that is? That’s paper. This is where paper comes from. Any questions?",2,18,25
Michael," No, we don’t actually cut the paper. That’s a good question. The paper is sent to us cut, and dyed, from a paper manufacturer, and then we sell it to a business for more than we paid for it. ",2,18,25
Michael," Yes it is, well, w-w–you need someone in the middle to facilitate…",2,18,25
Michael," You are describing Office Depot, and they’re kind of running us out of business. ",2,18,25
Michael," …There’s Creed! Let’s take a look at what he’s doing, everybody! This is Creed, and he is in charge of… something. Right?",2,18,25
Michael," What are you doing? N–stop it! Stop it! Just–no, no, no, no! No! Would you cut it out?! What is your problem? ",2,18,25
Michael," No no no, we’re not gonna see— we’re not gonna see the four toed… Creed, okay?   					",2,18,25
Michael," You know, there’s something interesting about me you might want to know. I … used to be … the star of a kids show. ",2,18,25
Michael, I am totally serious. There was a show called ‘Fundle Bundle’ and I was the star.,2,18,25
Michael," It’s true! I can prove it! I can prove it, watch this. [gets up and runs out] Ryan, can you come here a second? [clears throat] I would like you to go to my mother’s house in Dickson city, and if she is in the pool, the back kitchen window should be unlocked, I want you to boost yourself up, I want you to go down to the basement. In the basement is a tape labeled ‘Fundle Bundle’. I want you to grab it, I want you to get my guitar. ",2,18,25
Michael, I want you to get the tambourine. Do you know how to play the tambourine? ,2,18,25
Michael," Okay! Thank you Ryan. Good attitude, hottest in the office.   					",2,18,25
Michael," [to Abby] Alright, nowwww… what kind… of pizza do you like?   					",2,18,25
Michael," I don’t get why parents are always complaining about how tough it is to raise kids. You joke around with them, you give them pizza, you give them candy, you let them live their lives… They’re adults, for God’s sake.   					",2,18,25
Michael," I am going to give you a little blast from the past of Michael Gary Scott when he was a child star, and a show that you might remember called ‘Fundle Bundle.’ Okay? Without further ado, Ryan? ",2,18,25
Michael," That… is Miss Trudy. Can’t tell from the costume, but she had an amazing body. Okay, you can… fast forward. And… I want you… to… ",2,18,25
Michael," Stop! Stop! Stop! [Ryan resumes the tape] Yes! That is, uh, Edward R. Meow. ",2,18,25
Michael," Can everyone please shut up, please! So you don’t miss it.",2,18,25
Michael," …I guess not… you know, I have a load of work to do so I am going to grab a slice of this delish pizza… and I’m going to go do my work. Bye.  					",2,18,25
Michael, You have to ask me that because you work for human resources.,2,18,25
Michael," Well, sure, playing the field is great, don’t get me wrong, but there’s more to life than notches just on my bedpost. ",2,18,25
Michael," Tell me something honestly, do you… think… that it is too late for me to have kids?",2,18,25
Michael," Thanks, that’s, no, that… that really means a lot to me. Hey, does Sasha have a godfather, because I…",2,18,25
Michael," Yes, it is true. I, Michael Scott, am signing up with an online dating service. Thousands of people have done it, and I am going to do it. I need a username. And… I have a great one [types]. Little kid lover. That way, people will know exactly where my priorities are at.  					",2,18,25
Michael," Hey, uh, no, please? You can’t leave yet. There’s still one more thing we need to do. ",2,18,25
Michael, [singing] You… who are on the road… must have a code… that you can live by… [Dwight joins in] and so… become yourself… because the past… is just a goodbye… and teach… your children well… ,2,18,25
Michael, Don’t worry about Phil. He drives a corvette. He is doing just fine. Okay. Calling cards are… the wave of the future. These things sell themselves. ,2,19,26
Michael," You know what? That’s a nice attitude, Ryan, I’m just helping you invest in your future, my friend. ",2,19,26
Michael, Yes! Thank you! You will get rich quick. We all will!,2,19,26
Michael," You know what, Toby? When the son of the deposed king of Nigeria emails you directly, asking for help, you help! His father ran the freaking country, okay? …Alright, so, raise your hand if you wanna get rich. [Jim and Dwight raise their hands] Alright.",2,19,26
Michael," Alright, let me explain. Again. [draws on board] Phil has recruited me and another guy. Now, we are getting three people each. The more people that get involved, the more who are investing, the more money we’re all going to make. It’s not a pyramid scheme, it is a… it’s not even a scheme per se, it’s… [Jim draws a triangle around Michael’s diagram] … I have to go make a call.   					",2,19,26
Michael," Today is my B-day, and people around here just go crazy for it. I don’t know why. Oh! Fun fact. I share my birthday with Eva Longoria. So, I have a ",2,19,26
Michael," Thank you very much. It is from Italy. [checks jacket] Actually— no, Bulgaria.",2,19,26
Michael," Not necessary, the party planning committee is all over it.  They’ve been working twenty-four seven all day yesterday.",2,19,26
Michael," Don’t! Nope! Please, don’t want to spoil it for anybody. Spoil the surprise.",2,19,26
Michael, Let’s get the party started.  Not the way I taught you! [Michael joins in]  					,2,19,26
Michael," It is urgent, I just wanted to call and wish you a happy birthday.",2,19,26
Michael," Really? ‘Cause, I thought we had the same birthday.",2,19,26
Michael, Nope. Totally private. You can say whatever is in your heart. [Jan hangs up],2,19,26
Michael," [to Ryan, sitting across from Michael] …You can take a five, if you want.   					",2,19,26
Michael, Somebody brought in donuts for my birthday!,2,19,26
Michael," Well, I guess I forgot to give you a donut [closes box].",2,19,26
Michael," Here we go. Ohhhkay, this is great! [giggles] Thank you my friends, she is perfect! Ahhh, Dwight, may I have your chair please? And, um, some singles, if you will! Allllright. Nnnnn-dink! [puts single into delivery woman’s pocket, giggles] Okay, um, alright. This has arms. Is that gonna be a… is that alright? ",2,19,26
Michael," When I was seven, my mother hired a pony and a cart to come to my house for all the kids… and… I got a really bad rash from the pony, and all the kids got to ride the pony and I had to go inside, and my mother was rubbing cream on me… for probably three hours, and I never came outside. And by the time I got out the pony was already in the truck. And around the corner. So that was my worst birthday.  					",2,19,26
Michael, [eating donuts while Dwight plays the recorder] Stop it. Stop! What is that? ,2,19,26
Michael," Yeah, well, it’s on the radio. My birthday blows. Nobody even signed my birthday poster. Probably my mother is the only one that cares enough to send me anything.",2,19,26
Michael, You’re making it worse. I bet Luke Perry’s friends don’t treat him like this [points to James Dean poster].  					,2,19,26
Michael," Ohh, no, no, no! I can’t… Ryan, come on. Let’s do this.",2,19,26
Michael, Whoa whoa! Alright. Alright. Watch it… please. ,2,19,26
Michael," Well, then just have the tomato and ketchup. Still good.",2,19,26
Michael, Mm-kay. Get whatever you want. [under breath] And choke on it.  					,2,19,26
Michael," When I was sixteen, I was supposed to go out on a date with a girl named Julie. But there was another Michael in the class that she apparently thought the date was with, so she went out with him, on my birthday. And, she got him a cake, at the restaurant. And it wasn’t even his birthday, but I heard about it the next day in school. So… ",2,19,26
Michael, Uhhh… blow out the candle. Okay. Mmmm… [blows out the candles],2,19,26
Michael," Okay. Well, when she comes back we’ll do it again. [notices Meredith hugging Kevin] Hello, what about the birthday boy? Haven’t had a hug all day. ",2,19,26
Michael," … Aww, that… sucks, great. … Wow, that’s good timing. That’s… that’s, sorry, that’s terrible. Terrible news. That’s terrible… terrible news for both of us [takes cake into office and slams the door].  					",2,19,26
Michael, There you are. Good news. Did some research. It turns out that 98% of people with skin cancer fully recover.,2,19,26
Michael," Yeah, but it’s not brain cancer. And it shouldn’t stop us from having fun. You know what they say the best medicine is.",2,19,26
Michael, Why are you here? I didn’t even invite you to my birthday party.,2,19,26
Michael," [mocking voice] Nyeh, I work here. [to Kevin] Alright, well, you know what, since Toby doesn’t speak for everybody and I am your boss, I… think you should just go home. Take the rest of the afternoon off. Take a sick day.",2,19,26
Michael," Well, you’re pretty much driving everyone else here crazy… crazy with worry.  					",2,19,26
Michael," Excuse me, everyone. Attention please. Kevin, we’re going to take you to a very special place, a place that will make you happy, and a place that is far, far away from the evil sun. ",2,19,26
Michael, How dare you sir. You are gross.   					,2,19,26
Michael, [sees ‘Happy Birthday Michael Scott!’ poster at skating rink] That should not be there.,2,19,26
Michael," No, it’s alright. It’s already up. Just leave it. Where’s Kevin? Come on! Let’s get our skate on!  					",2,19,26
Michael," Yeah, I’ve been pretty much skating my whole life. I thought about playing in the NHL, but, you’re on the road so much. You got no time to spend with your wife and kids. And I really want a wife and kids.  					",2,19,26
Michael," Hey Pam, all this stuff with Kevin… um, it’s pretty scary. And I’m thinking that uh, next time you’re in the shower, you should check yourself out. You know, give yourself an exam. Those things are like ticking time bags. Alright? Think about it.",2,19,26
Michael," Yeah. Carol? She sold me my condo! Hey! What, is this place on the market? Or…",2,19,26
Michael," Oh, hey guys. Whats up? You wanna go for a ride? Is that okay? ",2,19,26
Michael, Cool. Alright. Grab on. Here we go. Ready? Hang on tight. Alright. We are moving. We are reaaallly mooovin’ now!  					,2,19,26
Michael, Push. Good! That’s great. You got it. [Kevin’s phone rings] Excuse me.,2,19,26
Michael," Oh… God… [stomps] God! [throws hockey stick and yellow paper bracelet down] We’re gonna beat this, okay? We’re gonna… come here [hugs Kevin].  					",2,19,26
Michael," Well, apparently in the medicine community, negative means good. Which makes absolutely no sense. In the real world community, that would… be… chaos.  					",2,19,26
Michael," Okay, who’s this from? Wowwwee, look at that! Jersey!",2,19,26
Michael, Thank you… Dwight. That’s great. Thanks.,2,19,26
Michael, Oh! You didn’t need to do that. …Nightswept. This is… really amazing. Thank you. I love it.   					,2,19,26
Michael," Ry, is he bugging you? Dwight, dude, you gotta take a chill pill, man. It was one joint in the parking lot. You know, you’re totally harshing the office mellow. ",2,20,27
Michael, I wasn’t attempting to compliment you. ,2,20,27
Michael," Why don’t you just cool it, cool it Dwight, please, God! [to Jim] Dude, where’s my office? [Jim quietly laughs] I totally lost it, ’cause I was half-baked. Smokin’ doobies. Doobie brothers, I was smokin’ doobies with my brothers. Peace out, Seacrest! ",2,20,27
Michael, Thanks. M-m-munchies. Who wants some munchies?   				,2,20,27
Michael, Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Who’s he calling?  Ratting somebody out.  Narc!  Narc!  Kevin?,2,20,27
Michael," Remember the narc bit? [laughs] Uh-oh, who’s in trouble?   				",2,20,27
Michael, Waa… what? What are you talking about? ,2,20,27
Michael," Two nights ago, I went to an Alicia Keys concert at the Montage Mountain Performing Arts Center. I scored these great aisle seats. Anyway, after the opening act this beautiful girl sits down next to me and I never get to meet girls with lip rings and she had one. I don’t know exactly how this happened but one of her friends started passing around some stuff and they said it was clove cigarettes, and I’m sure that it was clove cigarettes. Everybody in the aisle was doing it.   				",2,20,27
Michael," Okay, attention everyone the drug testing has been cancelled.  Instead, I will be going around to each of you and doing a visual inspection. ",2,20,27
Michael, Hmmm. Ha. [under his breath] Alright. Great.   				,2,20,27
Michael, It has come to my attention that some people here think that the use of drugs is something to laugh about. ,2,20,27
Michael," No, uh, no. That was a test.  I was testing you, and you all failed. Miserably. When I said that Dwight was a narc, how many of you defended him?  How many of you said, “Hey, you know what, he’s right? What he’s doing is protecting this office from the evils of drugs.” ",2,20,27
Michael," I am ridiculously anti-drug. So anti-drug that I am above suspicion in any way that involves suspicion, or testing of any kind.   				",2,20,27
Michael," Drugs ruin lives people. Drugs destroy careers. Take Cheech and Chong everybody knows that Cheech and Chong are funny, but just imagine how funny they would be if they didn’t smoke pot.  I want everybody to take a look to their left. Now I want everybody to take a look to their right. One of those people will be dead from drug use at some point in their lives. This year more people will use cocaine than will read a book to their children. ",2,20,27
Michael," Are these facts scaring you, or are they not?",2,20,27
Michael, Do you think that smoking drugs is cool? Do you think that doing alcohol is cool?,2,20,27
Michael," Okay, enough, enough, enough! I have written down a list of illegal drugs. Take a gander. How many of these are you familiar with?",2,20,27
Michael," Okay, you know what, Toby? Pam, can you take this down? [Pam throws her hands up to indicate she has no notepad] In addition to Toby’s urine being tested, I would like to test his blood and his hair. ",2,20,27
Michael," I can test anyone randomly, and I have chosen you randomly. ",2,20,27
Michael," Okay, eeny, meenie, miney, moe, is random.  Okay, you know what? I’m going to need a volunteer to select one of these words and tell us of something tragic that happened in either their lives, or the lives of a loved one.  Yeah, Pam. ",2,20,27
Michael," Jim it’s okay. You can t… [Jim looks at Pam and shakes his head, Pam looks at him and gestures for Jim to go up and tell his story] This would be a good place to let it out, Jim. These are people you can trust. These are people who care about you. [Jim shakes his head no] It’s okay, just we will not judge you. We are here to not judge you. [Jim stands up] Oh, he’s doing it, okay. [Jim looks at Pam] It’s okay. [Jim pretends to try, looking teary eyed, shakes his head no, mouths “I can’t” and sits back down. Pam is amazed.] Oh. Okay, are you sure? [Jim shakes his head. Kevin pats his shoulder] That looked like it was going to be good. Alright. [Pam nods in admiration at Jim] Okay, well.   				",2,20,27
Michael," The point I’m trying to make with all of this people is that I hate drugs. I hate them, and based upon what I have seen you all don’t quite hate ’em as much as I do so you are going to have a drug test, and I am not. ",2,20,27
Michael," Okay, well Dwight just know that I’ve been very busy today and I got a lot of work to do and I wasn’t planning on going to the bathroom and I don’t even know if anything is going to come out, okay? So good. Thank you.   				",2,20,27
Michael, So I need you to do some work on the St. Andrews account. I need your urine. I need some filing done.,2,20,27
Michael," Yes in a cup, we’re not animals, Dwight. ",2,20,27
Michael," Okay. Alright. Just, I went to an Alicia Keys concert, over the weekend, and I think I may have gotten high accidentally by a girl with a lip ring. ",2,20,27
Michael," Don’t think of it that way. It’s like, urine goes all over the place. You know, there’s no controlling it. It just… goes",2,20,27
Michael, A cup could find its way under the urine. It might be an accident. It happens. ,2,20,27
Michael," No, just look. Look. Just… just fill up the cup.   				",2,20,27
Michael," Dwight. Well, I passed the test thanks to you and your untainted pee. Thank you very much. ",2,20,27
Michael," Since you did such a good job with the investigation, I decided to pull a few strings. Call in a few favors. and I’ve decided to make you official security supervisor of the branch.",2,20,27
Michael," Yes, thanks, Fantastic Sam’s. Adult Cut Plus. Comes with a shampoo and blow dry. We’re doing I.D. photos today. Gotta represent.  					",2,21,28
Michael, Do you mind if I wear that for the photo?,2,21,28
Michael, [walking into the Conference room] What’s the dealio?,2,21,28
Michael," So what, you’re having a little spat. I forget, are you guys dating?",2,21,28
Michael, What do you know about conflict resolution? Your answer to everything is to get divorced. So… ,2,21,28
Michael," Yeah, well… that’s not gonna fly here. Because in this office, it is till death do us part… assuming we don’t get downsized. [leans over to Pam] Uh, Pam, will you get Angela and meet us in the conference room please?  					",2,21,28
Michael," [holding up a binder] A mediator’s tool chest. Okay, well, before we get started, you should know that are 5 different styles of conflict.[in a comedic voice] My Shaolin temple style defeats your monkey style.",2,21,28
Michael," No. Okay, this is important. The first style is lose/lose.",2,21,28
Michael," Just hold on, please! Okay, if we do lose/lose, neither of you gets what you want. Do you understand? You… you would both lose. Now I need to ask you, do you want to pursue a lose/lose negotiation?",2,21,28
Michael," Win/Win is number four and number five is win/win/win. The important difference here is with win/win/win, we all win. Me too. I win for having successfully mediated a conflict at work.  					",2,21,28
Michael," [in front of poster] Okay, since this is the disputed poster. Now, one at a time, I want you to express your feelings using “I” emotion language and no judging or “you” statements.",2,21,28
Michael," Okay, okay. Stop, stop, stop! Let’s see if we can just brainstorm and find some creative alternatives that are win/win.",2,21,28
Michael," Yes. Thank you, Pam. How about Angela makes the poster into a t-shirt, which Oscar wears. That way, he can never see it and whenever she looks at Oscar, she can see it. Win/win/win.  ",2,21,28
Michael," Okay… well, brainstorm. Own the solution.",2,21,28
Michael," Okay, that is called a compromise. And it is style 3. And it is not ideal. To sum up, win/win – make the poster into a t-shirt, win/lose – take the poster down, compromise – Tuesdays and Thursdays. And the answer is… make the poster into a t-shirt! Win/win.",2,21,28
Michael," You can’t do that, huh? Huh, ok. Now you and I have a conflict. I order you to give me that file.",2,21,28
Michael," Okay. [yanks the file away, despite Toby’s resistance] There! No more conflict. [looks at the camera] I had to use win/lose on that. It was not pretty. [looks back at Toby] All right… is that it?",2,21,28
Michael, Ohh… God. Alright. Why do I have to do everything?  					,2,21,28
Michael," [looking through papers in the complaint box] This is from Kevin. He says Stanley uses his Miracle Whip without asking. Meredith complains that everyone talks too loud in the morning and the lights are too bright. Creed… huh. Duh, duh. Creed is sick of looking at the redhead all day and wants a seat facing the receptionist.",2,21,28
Michael, You will notice that not one of these complaints is against me.  					,2,21,28
Michael," How many of you have at one time gone to Toby to complain about another employee? [looks at all the employees, most of whom raise their hands] And… did you get what you wanted, or were you merely listened to, you forget about your problem, and you move on? [employees mumble “merely listen to and forgotten…” ] That is outrageous! I love this place… and it pains me to see all of the negativity festering… [sighs] Okay, today we are going to get everything out of these files and into the open, where it can be resolved. Alright, how about the Phyllis/Angela dispute?",2,21,28
Michael," That’s what she said. [Jim mouths these words along with Michael] The thing is, Angela… you are in here an awful lot. You have complained about everybody in the office, except Dwight, which is odd because everyone else has had run ins with Dwight. Toby, by the way, what does “redacted” mean? There is a file full of complaints in here marked “redacted”… ?",2,21,28
Michael," Oh, ok. There were a bunch of complaints about Dwight that were put in the redacted file about six months ago.",2,21,28
Michael,"  All right, Pamela. Come on down! Let’s do it! And [looks through the file]… okay. Just one complaint. Actually, it has been withdrawn. So that is no help to us. Next.",2,21,28
Michael," Uh… [reading]”Does she have to plan her wedding on office time? Couldn’t she do that at home?” [Pam looks Angela an angry look] Who else? Why don’t we just warm up first? Warm up emotionally, all right?   					",2,21,28
Michael," Here is a Kelly complaint: “Ryan never returns my calls.” Ugh, join the club.",2,21,28
Michael, [crumbles up the complaint paper] Makin’ progress. [Jim raises his hand] Yes?,2,21,28
Michael, [still of camera] You got a lot of anger under there buddy. Come on start us out. Unleash it.,2,21,28
Michael," Someone complained that the men’s room is “whites only”. Stanley, you know that’s not true.",2,21,28
Michael," Okay, Phyllis. You complained that Angela’s giving you dirty looks. And you tried to get off the party planning committee.",2,21,28
Michael," And… also, Phyllis, Stanley says that you cry too much, and that bugs him.",2,21,28
Michael," OK, Ryan.  You told Toby that Creed has a distinct old man smell?  					",2,21,28
Michael," All right, Kevin. You are accused of making sexually suggestive remarks to Angela that made her feel uncomfortable. Solution:  Angela, you are to make sexually suggestive remarks to Kevin that will make him uncomfortable.",2,21,28
Michael, [picks up Dwight’s I.D. and snickers] You know your I.D. says you’re a security threat?,2,21,28
Michael," Okay… you two, in the conference room with me. Nobody leaves until we work this out. Cage match!  					",2,21,28
Michael," Cage matches? Yeah, they work. How could they not work? If they didn’t work, everybody would still be in the cage.  					",2,21,28
Michael," Okay, so Dwight, in your own words – [reads from complaint paper] “Someone replaced all my pens and pencils with crayons. I suspect Jim Halpert.” [flips to another paper] “Everyone has called me ‘Dwayne’ all day. I think Jim Halpert paid them to.”  					",2,21,28
Michael," [reading] “This morning, I found a bloody glove in my desk drawer and Jim Halpert tried to convince me I committed murder. I think he may be the real murderer.” [flips to another paper] “Jim Halpert said there was an abandoned infant in the woman’s room. When I went to save the child, I saw Meredith on the can.”  Gah. “This morning, I knocked myself in the head with the phone.”  					",2,21,28
Michael," [reading] “Every time I typed my name, it said ‘Diapers’.”  					",2,21,28
Michael," “By the end of the day, my desk was about two feet closer to the copier.”  					",2,21,28
Michael," The Japanese have this thing called shiatsu massage, where they dig into your body, very hard. And it is very painful. And apparently, some people throw up. But the next day they feel great. I’ve never had one. They sound awful.  					",2,21,28
Michael," Hey, there’s like, 300 more of these. Let’s get to them later.",2,21,28
Michael," Maybe, I haven’t decided yet. Let’s get to work.",2,21,28
Michael," Okay. Oh… actually, tomorrow’s not good. How about later in the week?",2,21,28
Michael, Hey! Wait. How about a group picture while you’re here?,2,21,28
Michael," Well… that’s… what, a computer camera, right?",2,21,28
Michael," Ugh… All right. Everybody, [looks around at the employees] come on. Group photo for the newsletter.    ",2,21,28
Michael," We resolved a lot today, everybody. Think happy thoughts.",2,21,28
Michael," Good, let’s check that out. [looks at preview screen] Ew, okay, all right. One more. We’ll take one more.",2,21,28
Michael, [off camera] You just press the button.,2,21,28
Michael," [off camera] Okay, good. Check that out.",2,21,28
Michael," [off camera] Let’s pay Mr. Price Gouger. [rejoins the group, on camera] Okay… we can do this. Come on, everybody. All right. Here we go. [flash goes off before he sits down]  					",2,21,28
Michael,  It was really hard getting a good picture of fifteen people. He would not give me a good discount. And eight tries added up.  					,2,21,28
Michael," [flashback the photo being taken] One, two..[flash goes off] Didn’t say three, did I?  					",2,21,28
Michael," But, I’m sort of an expert at Photoshop, so it turned out fine in the end. When people work together, there is going to be conflict. You can’t outrun your problems.  					",2,21,28
Michael, And that is why the idea of a cage match is so universally appealing. But here’s the thing about cage matches: sometimes you have to open the cage. And that is something Toby will never understand.  					,2,21,28
Michael, I try not to think of it as lagging behind. It’s more of a David-and-Goliath thing.,2,22,29
Michael," Jan, listen, I promise that I will kick it up a notch. Bam!",2,22,29
Michael," Emeril. Oh, actually, while I have you, not that I have you or have ever had you, but we’re having our Casino Night tonight and I think everyone would love to see their fearless leader here. ",2,22,29
Michael," I am, but you are the Eva Peron to my Cesar Chavez.",2,22,29
Michael," You know, it’d be fun. I can hear it in your voice. You need a break.",2,22,29
Michael," Jan and I understand each other. The romance thing is sort of on hold for the time being, but we’ve remained good friends. Good friends with privileges. Not now, some day.   				",2,22,29
Michael," Okay, everybody. Tonight’s event is to benefit the Boy Scouts of America.",2,22,29
Michael," Well, they need our money. They don’t have cookies like the Girl Scouts.",2,22,29
Michael," Well, Oscar, if you don’t like it, then you should concentrate on winning. Because the person at the end of the evening with the highest chip count will receive $500 to donate to the charity of their choice. And they will get a mini-fridge compliments of Vance Refrigeration.",2,22,29
Michael," So get your charities in to Pam. I, for example, am playing for Comic Relief.",2,22,29
Michael," Comedy is very much alive, as are homeless people.",2,22,29
Michael," Well, then, they need our money more than ever. ",2,22,29
Michael," Oh, and another fun thing. We, at the end of the night, are going to give the check to an actual group of Boy Scouts. Right, Toby? We’re gonna…",2,22,29
Michael," Why are you the way that you are? Honestly, every time I try to do something fun or exciting, you make it not… that way. I hate so much about the things that you choose to be. Okay, you know what? I will not donate my winnings to Comic Relief, since apparently it doesn’t exist. I am going to donate to Afghanistanis with AIDS. ",2,22,29
Michael," Okay, you know what? No. No. AIDS is not funny. Believe me, I have tried.   				",2,22,29
Michael," There are certain topics that are off-limits to comedians, JFK, AIDS, the Holocaust. The Lincoln Assassination just recently became funny. “I need to see this play like I need a hole in the head.” [laughs] And I hope to someday live in a world where a person could tell a hilarious AIDS joke. It’s one of my dreams.   				",2,22,29
Michael, I have already put down the deposit. Do you understand how a deposit works? ,2,22,29
Michael, It’s Casino Night like Las Vegas. There are fire-eaters all over the place. ,2,22,29
Michael, Give me some. [Michael and Darryl perform simultaneous hand gesture]  				,2,22,29
Michael," Oh, yeah, put her through. Hey Carol, how goes the real estate biz? Is it ",2,22,29
Michael," Oh, hey, no problemo. Incidentally, I love the place.",2,22,29
Michael," Great. It has a little bit of a weird smell. It’s okay. At Christmas, the tree helped. ",2,22,29
Michael," Actually, I’m sort of hosting this charity thing in our warehouse, Casino Night.",2,22,29
Michael," Yeah, it’ll be good. You know what? Why don’t you come by? Bring the papers, I’ll sign them and then you can stay and have a drink.",2,22,29
Michael, Yeah. It’ll be fun. What do you…[phone rings] What do you…,2,22,29
Michael," Okay, put her through. [Deep voice] Jan Levinson, I presume?",2,22,29
Michael," Bye Hello, Carol? Hi, sorry about that. I just…",2,22,29
Michael, Two queens on Casino Night. I am going to drop a deuce on everybody.  				,2,22,29
Michael," Oh, well… Kiss. [Michael kisses her on the cheek, pauses and then kisses her on the other cheek] That’s how we do it in the paper biz. It’s European and… Yes? Ah, Dwight [Kisses cheeks]",2,22,29
Michael, Can I get you a drink? The food is from Hooters.,2,22,29
Michael, Your nurse became your girlfriend? Sweet.,2,22,29
Michael," Welkommen, Bienvenue, and welcome to Monte Carlo! Dwight. I am no longer your boss. Lady Fortune is your boss.",2,22,29
Michael," Shut it, shut it, shut it. Will Lady Fortune be your mistress? Only time will tell, my friends. Leave all your preconceived notions about casinos at the door. Old friends, new lovers, and the disabled!  Welcome all! Great, okay. Shuffle up and deal. Let’s get it started! Black-Eyed Crows.",2,22,29
Michael, All-in. [Other players fold their hands]  				,2,22,29
Michael," Bluffing is a key part of poker, which is too bad, because I’m not very good at bluffing. Did you believe me?  				",2,22,29
Michael," Well, Toby, I went all-in on the first hand, so doesn’t that tell you that I might have good cards, too? So don’t be stupid. Just take it back.",2,22,29
Michael, You really screwed that up. [Michael leaves],2,22,29
Michael," Yeah, whatever. Hey, you know what? If luck weren’t involved, I would always be winning. [Sees Jan] Oh, my God. Oh, my God.",2,22,29
Michael," Look, okay, I think we’re all adults here, and it has always been my understanding that we have an open relationship.",2,22,29
Michael," After you said you weren’t coming, I invited Carol to come and I don’t think that I did anything wrong.",2,22,29
Michael," Four! [Holds dice in front of Carol] Blow. Blow for luck! Yeah! Also, you. Not playing favorites. [Holds dice in front of Jan] All right, here we go!",2,22,29
Michael," Love triangle. Drama. All worked out in the end, though. The hero got the girl. Who saw that coming? I did. And Jan was really happy for me. So actually the hero got two girls. He got the girl that he works with and he got the girl that he buys real estate from. So, I’ve got my New York girl and my local flavor. Life is good.  				",2,22,29
Michael,  No!  That is the fun of this place.  I call everybody “faggie”. Why would anybody find that offensive?,3,1,31
Michael," It wasn’t just an action movie, it was Die Hard!",3,1,31
Michael," OK, a little too far, crossed the line.",3,1,31
Michael, I would have never called him that if I knew.  You don’t… You don’t call retarded people “retards”.  It’s bad taste.  You call your friends “retards” when they’re acting retarded.  And I consider Oscar a friend.  					,3,1,31
Michael," Listen man, I am so sorry.  I had no idea.",3,1,31
Michael," No.  No it’s not.  I feel terrible about it.  I have been calling people “faggie” since I was in junior high, and I have never made this mistake.  If I don’t know how to behave, it is because I am just so far the opposite way, you know?  I’m just… I, I can’t even imagine… the… thing.  Maybe we could go out for a beer sometime.  And you could tell me… how… you do that to another dude.",3,1,31
Michael, [deep sigh] There could be others…  I need to know.  I don’t want to offend anybody else.  ,3,1,31
Michael," Yeah, I’m sure everyone would appreciate me treating them like they were gay.  					",3,1,31
Michael,"  Hey, what about Angela?   She’s hard and severe.  She could be a gay woman.",3,1,31
Michael,"  I don’t know, I can imagine her with another woman, can’t you?",3,1,31
Michael, Do some research.  Find out if there’s a way to tell by just looking at them.,3,1,31
Michael,  [sighs] Let’s call him and get the website.,3,1,31
Michael," I watch the L Word.  I watch, Queer as F***, so…",3,1,31
Michael,"  Well, gay pride, right? Gay pride parade?  It’s not like gay… shame festival.",3,1,31
Michael, I think Angela might be gay.  Could Oscar and Angela be having a gay affair?  Maybe!  Is that what this is about?,3,1,31
Michael," [laughs] Well, I’m not gay Jan, and you should know that better than anybody!",3,1,31
Michael," The company has made it my responsibility today to put an end to 100,000 years of being weirded out by gays.  					",3,1,31
Michael,"  Trick question!  Cause you can’t always tell, so… how would I know.  Is that the right answer?  					",3,1,31
Michael," [looking at gay porn] Nothing wrong with this stuff.  At all.  This is fine.  You know what.  Gay porn, straight porn, it’s all goooooood!  I don’t particularly get into this.  But uh, you know what.  I totally see the merit!  And actually… it is quite beautiful.  					",3,1,31
Michael," [yelling] All right, everybody in the conference room!  I don’t care if you are gay, or straight, or a lesbian, or overweight!  JUST GET IN HERE!  RIGHT NOW!    					",3,1,31
Michael,"  Did you know that gay used to mean happy?  When I was growing up it meant lame.  And now it means a man, who makes love… to other men.    					",3,1,31
Michael,"  We’re all homos!  Homosapiens.  Gays aren’t necessarily who you think they are, people.  I mean anybody could be gay.  Business-men.  Like antique dealers, or hairdressers, or… accountants.  Oscar, why don’t you take this opportunity to officially come out, to everybody here.  However you want to do it.  Go ahead.  Stand up.  I’m doing this for you.",3,1,31
Michael,  Who should be the judges and juries of our society?,3,1,31
Michael,"  Yes, that’s a good point.  She has a good point.  Because gay marriage currently is not legal, under U.S. law.  I bet a lot of straight men wish that applied to them.  So they could go out there and have some torrid unabashed monkey sex as much as they could.  You know?  Sounds pretty good, right?",3,1,31
Michael,"  That’s great.  Congratulations Phyllis.  That is great, and frankly kiiiiiiiind of amazing!  [laughs] See?  Everybody has a chance!  					",3,1,31
Michael,"  But still, Phyllis, in college?  Did you ever experiment with other women?  A lot of women do!",3,1,31
Michael, [laughing] Right!  [serious] And I take that as a compliment.,3,1,31
Michael,"  Well, I just like to look good OK, so —",3,1,31
Michael,"  No, I am just coming out myself.  I am coming out hetero!",3,1,31
Michael, No no no.  The only signal that I am sending is:,3,1,31
Michael,"  Look, if I was gay, I would be the most flamboyant gay you have ever seen.  I would be leading the parade covered in feathers, and just… I would be waving that rainbow flag.",3,1,31
Michael,"  You misunderstand– OK.  You know what, OK.  I uh, I’m gonna put my money where my mouth is.  You ready?  I am going to embrace Oscar.  You might want to watch this Angela, because you can’t catch anything.  Here we go.  We are going to make a statement.  You and I are going to make a statement together.  Oscar is my friend —",3,1,31
Michael," …and I just don’t care who sees it, doesn’t bother me!  					",3,1,31
Michael, [sobbing] I’m sorry I called you faggie.  You’re not faggie.  You’re a a good guy.  					,3,1,31
Michael,"  [embracing Oscar]You know what, I’m going to raise the stakes.  I want you to watch this.  And I want you to burn this into your brains.  Because this is an image that I want you people to remember for a long time to come.  Whenever you come into the office I want you to think about this.  [awkwardly kissing Oscar]  I did it.  See.  I’m still here.  We’re all still here. [everyone claps]",3,1,31
Michael,"  [Dwight gets up to kiss Oscar]  Oh come on!  Dwight!  Come on, man!  					",3,1,31
Michael,"  We are not in the playground anymore.  There are new rules.  We have to be mature.  But we can’t lose the spirit of child like wonder.  What is love…  anyway?  Maybe it’s supposed to break all the rules.  Like me and Jan.  Or Oscar… and some guy.  Life is short.  When two people find each other, what should stand in their way?  					",3,1,31
Michael,"  I am glad that today spurred social change.  That’s part of my job as regional manager.  But you know what?  Even if it didn’t, at least we put this matter to bed.  …that’s what she said.  Or he said.  					",3,1,31
Michael,"  Oh, there’s Gill.  Oscar’s roommate.  I wonder if he knows?  					",3,1,31
Michael," Angelina Jolie was on. And she adopted a baby from Asia, and she said that it changed her life. And that really inspired me. So, I want you to look into seeing how much a little Chinese baby would cost.",3,2,32
Michael," Um… find out if there’s a cheaper, less expensive baby out there, okay?",3,2,32
Michael, I don’t even know if I’ll want a baby in eight months.,3,2,32
Michael," You know what, Pam? If in ten years, I haven’t had a baby, and you haven’t had a baby… ",3,2,32
Michael," Guess where I am going. I will give you a hint. It is a booze-fueled sex romp, where anything goes. You are correct, sir! I am headed to Philadelphia for the Annual Northeastern Mid-Market Office Supply Convention. And Jim Halpert is going to be coming, which will be fun. Poor little guy. He’s been stuck working under Josh, the poor man’s Michael Scott, as he is known around my condo.  ",3,2,32
Michael," Oh, wow! Oh my God, I have a great idea. You know what you should do to be hilarious? Wear your wedding dress. It would be a great icebreaker.",3,2,32
Michael," Good to see you. There he is! There’s the traitor! Traitor! Traitor! Come here, you. Come here! Yeah! The product… the progidal… my son returns.  ",3,2,32
Michael," I was shocked when he told me he was transferring to Stamford. It’s like the firemen. You don’t leave your brothers behind, even if you find out that there is a better fire in Connecticut.  ",3,2,32
Michael," Yeah! Wow, I didn’t expect that. It’s good to see you too!",3,2,32
Michael," Jan? Look, I think we need to set some ground rules.",3,2,32
Michael," The eight-hundred pound gorilla in the room. Carol. I’m still dating her, so nothing can happen between us at the convention.",3,2,32
Michael, Thank you for being so brave with all of this. Thank you.  ,3,2,32
Michael, I know! That is specifically why I chose a room close to the elevator. More foot traffic.,3,2,32
Michael," Well, that’s how we do it in Scranton. Or did you forget? There ain’t no party like a Scranton party, ’cause a Scranton party don’t stop.",3,2,32
Michael," Hey, well, we have time! One for the road, gentlemen?",3,2,32
Michael, Wish I was. I love inside jokes. I’d love to be a part of one someday.,3,2,32
Michael," All right, see you guys down there. Change your mind, come back up.",3,2,32
Michael," Ugh, that would be gross. It’s not even lunch yet.  ",3,2,32
Michael, SWAG! Stuff we all get. I basically decorated my condo for free with all of my SWAG.  ,3,2,32
Michael," Check it out. Hi, I’m Michael Scott, Dunder-Mifflin.",3,2,32
Michael," You know what? I’m having a huge blowout tonight, Room 308. Hope you can come.",3,2,32
Michael," Well, cool! Okay, so… can I tell people you’re gonna be there?",3,2,32
Michael," Do you remember me from last year? There’s a party in my room, 308, can’t miss it, right off the elevator. Tonight. Be there!  ",3,2,32
Michael," I don’t have to, I just know. Yes, hello?",3,2,32
Michael, [into phone] See you in a bit. Bye-bye. [to Dwight] May I have a moment of your time please?  ,3,2,32
Michael, I want you to dig up some dirt on Josh. Find out if there are any skeletons in his attic.,3,2,32
Michael, Business has been pretty crazy around the office.,3,2,32
Michael, I will call him later with that message.,3,2,32
Michael, Toby Flenderson is everything that is wrong with the paper industry. Is he why you left?,3,2,32
Michael," Opportunity, promotion, blah, blah. You know, Jim, those are just words. Have you taken into account other factors, vis-a-vis bosses? Is Josh funnier than I am? Does he even have a girlfriend? Because I have two, basically.",3,2,32
Michael," Hey, Jan, Jan? Don’t worry, I have got the tip.",3,2,32
Michael," No, that was a different hundred dollar bill.",3,2,32
Michael, I have generated a lot of interest in my party this evening.,3,2,32
Michael," The party I’m having tonight in 308. Obviously, you are invited.",3,2,32
Michael," Hey, check this out. How about that? A little friendly competition. Stamford versus Scranton.",3,2,32
Michael," Oh, Jim. Looks like you picked a bad time to defect, my friend.",3,2,32
Michael," Shut it. [answering phone] Hey, Pam, what’s up? Yep, yech… no. Tell him I will give him general specifics tomorrow, okay? Yes. [to others] Say hi to Pam! ",3,2,32
Michael," Yes. That is Josh and Dwight and Jim. [to others] Pam says hi. [into phone] Have fun on your date! Very good, talk to you later. Bye.  ",3,2,32
Michael," Not. It hit the rim. Okay, and… okay. Double or nothing.",3,2,32
Michael," Jim and I have different definitions of friendship. I think it’s talking and being friends, and Jim thinks it’s moving to Connecticut and being best friends with Josh. Well, phooey on that. I, uh, I’m done. I am not going to be speaking with him anymore. Whatevs. Long-distance relationships never work.",3,2,32
Michael," Okay, let me tell you what we’re looking for.",3,2,32
Michael," Yes, Jan, really. With a rep from HammerMill.",3,2,32
Michael, Used to be. Evan will call you in the morning to work out the details. We can now sell HammerMill products.,3,2,32
Michael," Yeah, well, maybe next time you will estimate me.  ",3,2,32
Michael," Hey, first guest! You are going to have some tequila, my friend.",3,2,32
Michael," Party central! So, what can I do you for? [Guy leaves] All right.  ",3,2,32
Michael," Sure, sounds good. So why are you here? Is Josh busy?",3,2,32
Michael," I get it! No, no, I totally get it. He made a better paper airplane, Stamford is better in sales… I get it. We had some fun. We had some laughs. And that’s just… ",3,2,32
Michael, Oh my God. You don’t even know. She’s single now.,3,2,32
Michael," I’m sorry, man. I’m sorry. Hey, you know what? I will talk to her.",3,2,32
Michael," I will. I’ll talk to her. You should at least talk to Roy. I mean, he knows exactly how you’re feeling.",3,2,32
Michael," Hey! No, you know, people have been filtering in and out.",3,2,32
Michael," Some people need dozens of friends to say, “Hey, look at me, I’m popular.” But not me. I’m very picky. I need three, maybe two. When you meet that someone special, you’ll just know. Because a real relationship, it… it can’t be forced. It should just come about effortlessly.  ",3,2,32
Michael," Now, would you do the pleasure of hitting the lights, sir? [lights go out, leaving Michael’s black light on] Ha, ha, ha.",3,2,32
Michael," Today I’m headed to Philadelphia for the annual Northeastern Office Supply Convention. [makes horns gesture and heavy metal scream] Wooo-yaaaaah! Oh, these things tend to be kind of crazy.  ",3,2,32
Michael," Per-diem. [singing as he signs] Perrrr-diiiiieeeemmmm! [shows off $100 bill to Ryan] You know, Ryan, it’s all about the Benjamins.",3,2,32
Michael," Yes. What? Oh, yeah, have Pam give those to me.",3,2,32
Michael, Gonna be fun! Change your mind we can get you a cot.,3,2,32
Michael," A couple of years ago, I went to one in Hartford. “Connecticut.” And Todd Packer and I went to this bar and met a girl. And [laugh] Packer decides to make out with her. Turns out that her boyfriend is the bouncer at the bar. [laugh] I love this. The bouncer chases us out to Packer’s Vette, jump in the Vette, he ",3,2,32
Michael," I know, I know. Crazy world. Crazy, crazy world.  ",3,2,32
Michael," Josh reminds me of a guy I went to high school with. Big football star, girls loved him. Whatever. Guess what he’s doing now. He’s a TV announcer for the Eagles. Up in the… [laughs] He doesn’t even get to play in the game, I mean.  ",3,2,32
Michael," Let’s gooooo! Let’s go, let’s go, let’s go!",3,3,33
Michael," Kevin, would you like to do the scenes from last week?",3,3,33
Michael, Don’t whine.  Get the window. [Dwight exhales]  ,3,3,33
Michael, [Jan walks in on Movie Monday] Hi Jan!  Hope you brought the Milk Duds!  ,3,3,33
Michael, No… they have to… to make up for the time they lost watching the movie.,3,3,33
Michael," Three hours, wow.  Have fun.  [Dwight walks away staring through the blinds at Michael]  ",3,3,33
Michael,  What was Dwight thinking?  That he could turn Jan against me?  She’s my ex-lover!  …ish.  ,3,3,33
Michael," No seriously.  You should have an M&M, they’re really good.  ",3,3,33
Michael, Hey.  I thought you weren’t supposed to eat anything for a couple hours after you’ve had a crown put in.,3,3,33
Michael, Let me see your teeth.  Let me see ’em.  Let me see ’em.,3,3,33
Michael, [exhales] Well then… I am glad you’re ok.  ,3,3,33
Michael," Business is like a jungle.  And I… am like a tiger.  And Dwight, is like a monkey, that stabs the tiger in the back with a stick.  Does the tiger fire the monkey?  Does the tiger transfer the monkey to another branch?  [smiling] Pun.  There is no way of knowing what goes on inside the tiger’s head.  We don’t have the technology.  ",3,3,33
Michael," Dwight, can I talk to you for a second?   ",3,3,33
Michael," [in Michael’s office] Wow, this is tough.",3,3,33
Michael," Well, I just got off the phone with Jan.  And um… she demoted me.",3,3,33
Michael,  Yeah. You know what the craziest part of this is? She demoted me to your job!  ,3,3,33
Michael," And she said that you should be expecting a call later from corporate, and that um, I guess that means that you are going to be acting manager of Dunder Mifflin, Scranton.",3,3,33
Michael, I know.  I told her I didn’t know whether you’d wanna do it… because you’ve always been so loyal to me.  You’ve been my most trusted ally.,3,3,33
Michael," Yep, I did.  I did.  But I think… you should do it. ",3,3,33
Michael," [exhales] Perfect, well, we’re settled.",3,3,33
Michael," All right.  Well then, you are now acting manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton Branch, and I… am assistant regional manager.",3,3,33
Michael, [muttering] Can’t you?  That’s so nice.  ,3,3,33
Michael, Well… I guess we should go tell the troops.,3,3,33
Michael," Hey, hi, hello.  Everybody, I have some good news, and I have some bad news.  I… am being replaced, as your leader, by Dwight.  ",3,3,33
Michael," You might think that I am kidding, and I understand that.",3,3,33
Michael," Ok, Dwight, would you like to say a few words to everybody… about loyalty?  ",3,3,33
Michael," Well, I guess it’s time, that I turn over the keys, to the famous Sebring.",3,3,33
Michael," It’s a corporate lease Dwight, you’ve earned it.  ",3,3,33
Michael, But you said you liked it.  You’ve always admired it.,3,3,33
Michael," I know, Dwight.  I know.  I know.  I know.",3,3,33
Michael, Jan called me about your little meeting!,3,3,33
Michael," I know, what you did.  I made the whole thing up, Dwight.",3,3,33
Michael," Oh do you?  Do you like the Sebring— HOW DARE YOU?!  How dare you, Dwight?",3,3,33
Michael, Give me one good reason why I should fire you RIGHT HERE ON THE SPOT?!,3,3,33
Michael, I don’t know if I can trust you anymore.,3,3,33
Michael," You can get up.  Get up. [Dwight gets up with spit hanging from his lips] And you can hug it out, bitch.  [Dwight and Michael have a firm embrace]  ",3,3,33
Michael," Hug it out, bitch.  That is what men say to each other, after a fight.  They hug it out, and doing so, the just… let it go.  And walk away.  And they’re done.  Not a good idea to say that to a woman however.  I have found.  It doesn’t translate.  ",3,3,33
Michael,"  Yep.  Yeah, we hugged it out.  But, it turns out, I was still a little angry.  So, I felt I needed to punish him, just a little bit more, [cut to Dwight standing on a box with “LIAR” written on a piece of paper hung around his neck, Dwight’s head hung in shame] and I’m making him do my laundry for a year.   ",3,3,33
Michael, Okay. [Jan leaves Michael’s office; Dwight enters],3,3,33
Michael," What do you know about management, Dwight?",3,3,33
Michael," Okay. Here we go. Everybody, you know what? It dawned on me we were all in there watching a movie together before we were so rudely interrupted, Let’s get back in there. [no takers] Come on. Movie Monday! Come on, Stanley let’s go.",3,3,33
Michael," Okay, well, we had scheduled this time to watch a movie together, so I guess I will just go play some online Scrabble.",3,3,33
Michael," So, she sleeps with him, but she is still in love with the head surgeon, um, the McDreamy guy, and she starts crying, but the dorky doctor, he’s in love with her… [phone rings]",3,3,33
Michael," All right, I’ll be right back. [goes down pretend stairs]",3,4,34
Michael, Don’t mind if I do.  See you in a minute.  [goes back down pretend stairs and grabs pen from Stanley’s desk],3,4,34
Michael," There you go, fresh from the warehouse.",3,4,34
Michael," [breathless] All right.  Okay. [goes back down pretend stairs, crawls on belly to the kitchen for the coffee]  				",3,4,34
Michael, I am like Bette Midler in For the Boys.  Gotta keep the troops entertained.   				,3,4,34
Michael," Oookay.  Let me see if I have his cell.  Is this the only reason you are calling, Jan?  Or does somebody miss me?",3,4,34
Michael," Attention, everybody.  I just received a call from corporate with some news they felt that I should know first.  My old boss Ed Truck has died.",3,4,34
Michael," Yes, I am.  It’s very sad.  Because he was my boss.",3,4,34
Michael," That’s right, you worked with him.  So did Creed.  Well, I’ll be in my office in case anybody wants to drop by.  Cheer me up.    				",3,4,34
Michael," Oh, gosh, what can anybody do, really?  It’s… pssssh… .  He was almost 70.  Circle of life.  ",3,4,34
Michael," The older you get, the bigger the chance is you’re gonna die.  You knew that.",3,4,34
Michael," That is just not the way a Dunder Mifflin manager should go, I’m sorry.  Alone, out of the blue, and not even have his own head to comfort him.  				",3,4,34
Michael," [clears throat] So, I’m not exactly sure how to say this… ",3,4,34
Michael, I didn’t… he was driving on the road and he went under a truck.  And that’s when his head was separated from the rest of him.  And I will let you know more as soon as I find out.  				,3,4,34
Michael," I don’t understand. We have a day honoring Martin Luther King, but he didn’t even work here. ",3,4,34
Michael," You really don’t get it, do you?  You don’t understand these people.  That is the last thing that they would want is a day off. ",3,4,34
Michael," Well, I think it would be very realistic, it would look just like him. ",3,4,34
Michael," We could have his eyes light up, we could have his arms move… ",3,4,34
Michael, I think that is a great way to honor Ed.,3,4,34
Michael," Well, we are talking about how to properly honor a man who gave his life as regional manager of this company, Jan.",3,4,34
Michael, Oh do you?  You know who wished they could get back to work is Ed Truck.  ,3,4,34
Michael," Oohh… can you imagine how much blood there was?  If it happened right here, it would reach all the way to reception.  Probably get on Pam.",3,4,34
Michael," Well, you know what?  I didn’t wanna hear about it either, Stanley, but I did and now I can’t stop picturing it.  He leaves work, he’s on his way home… wham!  His cappa is detated from his head!",3,4,34
Michael," Well, you know what?  There’s something wrong with you.  There is something wrong with everybody in here.  Because we have lost a member of our family and you don’t wanna talk about it, you don’t wanna think about it, you just wanna get back to work!  				",3,4,34
Michael," There are five stages to grief, which are [glancing at computer screen] denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance.  And right now, out there, they’re all denying the fact that they’re sad.  And that’s   hard.  And it’s making them all angry.  And it is my job to try to get them all the way through to acceptance.  And if not acceptance, then just depression.  If I can get them depressed, then I’ll have done my job.  				",3,4,34
Michael," I am going to throw you this ball.  When you catch the ball, I want you to say the name of a person very important to you, somebody really special who died, and then I want you to say how they died, and you may cry if you like, that is encouraged.  Let me just start.  Let me show you how this works.   I catch the ball.  I lost Ed Truck.  And… it feels like somebody took my heart and dropped it into a bucket of boiling tears… and at the same time, somebody else is hitting my soul in the crotch with a frozen sledgehammer… and then a third guy walks in and starts punching me in the grief bone… and I’m crying, and nobody can hear me, because I am terribly, terribly… terribly alone. ",3,4,34
Michael," [as Pam returns to conference room] Okay, we can start.  Um… ",3,4,34
Michael," Yeah.  Pam, you’re a member of this family.  So we will wait for our family members. Phyllis, you wanna give it a shot?",3,4,34
Michael," Okay, why don’t you throw the ball to somebody else. ",3,4,34
Michael," [returning ball to Stanley] Oh, yes Stanley.  Come on.  Your turn, you have to go.",3,4,34
Michael, Okay… I’m going to toss the ball to Pam.,3,4,34
Michael, Wait a second.  That’s Weekend at Bernie’s. [upset] Do you think that this is a game? ,3,4,34
Michael, You are not leaving.  No!  We are not done.,3,4,34
Michael," Yeah.  Well, you know what?  The guy who had my job has died.  And nobody cares!  And he sat at my desk. [breaking down]",3,4,34
Michael, That that bird was dead?  Did you check its breathing?  ,3,4,34
Michael," Was its heart beating, Toby?  Did you check it?  No, of course you didn’t.  You’re not a veterinarian.  You don’t know ANYTHING! [runs out of conference room crying]",3,4,34
Michael," No, he’s not. [cradling bird next to face]",3,4,34
Michael," Well, you can’t get diseases from a bird!  				",3,4,34
Michael, Attention everybody.  This will only take a second of your time.  Today at 4 p.m. we will be meeting in the parking lot to have a funeral service for this bird.,3,4,34
Michael," Well, I’m sorry to inconvenience you, Meredith.  But that is what you do when things die.  You honor them.  Toby killed this bird.  And now we are going to honor it.  ",3,4,34
Michael," No, no, no!  That’s enough!  You know what?  This bird is dead.  He died alone.  The least you can do is be there for him now. [to Dwight] Find a box for him.  				",3,4,34
Michael," It’s okay.  It’s okay. [pats Kelly on shoulder] Shh… yes, I know, I know. It’s been a tough day, but it’s good to let it show.",3,4,34
Michael," No, God, no it’s not!  What is the matter with you?  Is that the beak!?  				",3,4,34
Michael, You made this?  Wow. [impressed] That’s… that’s very nice.  				,3,4,34
Michael," Society teaches us that  having feelings and crying is bad and wrong. Well, that’s baloney, because grief isn’t wrong. There is such a thing as good grief. Just ask Charlie Brown.   				",3,4,34
Michael," Wow. Well. Ok. I don’t care how your day was either, Jan. I was just asking you because you asked me. Why do you set me up like that?",3,5,35
Michael, I worked. And then I went home to my condo. And Carol came over. And then we had sex. Is that what you want to hear?  ,3,5,35
Michael," Never ever, ever sleep with your boss. I am so lucky that Jan and I only got to second base.   ",3,5,35
Michael," Hey Koselli, the Kos. Cosby. Hey hey hey. I love Jello Pudding Pops. My son, Theo, loves Jello Pudding Pops too.   ",3,5,35
Michael," Productivity is important but how can I be productive if I have this one little thing in my brain? That I cannot get out. And that one little thing is a soft pretzel. So I’m just going to have my soft pretzel, then I’ll get to work, and I’ll be super productive. Look out for me.  ",3,5,35
Michael," [looks at long pretzel line] Oh, shhh… Come on.  ",3,5,35
Michael," [Phyllis embraces Bob ahead in line] Hey, hey, hey! Phyllis, what are you doing?",3,5,35
Michael, Boooooo. Thank you. [hi-five’s Stanley]. That’s right. ,3,5,35
Michael," No cuts. Oh, Pam. Just the woman I’d like to see. You read my mind. ",3,5,35
Michael, I thought that maybe you could wait in line for me while I go to the bathroom. You’re an angel.,3,5,35
Michael," Because I like them a certain way, and if it gets screwed up, then whole thing is blown. ",3,5,35
Michael," Pam, productivity starts with patience and determination. I’ll be back.   ",3,5,35
Michael, Hi. Please tell me that you have a sweet pretzel left.,3,5,35
Michael," Is there anyway that you could do all, all of them?",3,5,35
Michael," Mr. Kosseli. Hey hey hey, the Cos. What’s going on? Do we have a deal? Deal or no deal? Let’s make a deal. So what is the deal?  ",3,5,35
Michael," Oh! Hey! Everyone, I am officially streamlining the efficiency of this corporation. Second…",3,5,35
Michael," Yes, second, Toby. Second, I am insisting on increased accountability from every single one of you. ",3,5,35
Michael," Carmel Dip. But, one question at a time please. Phyllis, Stanley. I want you to switch desks, I’m going to reorganize and restructure the physical layout of the office to maximize everything! I think we’re getting a lot done, don’t you? On paper at least. And we are, after all, a paper company. Are we not, are we not, are we not? Are you with me, are you with me? Thank you very much!   ",3,5,35
Michael," Tonight, one of our most ethnic co-workers, Kelly, has invited us all to a Diwali celebration put on by her community. What is Diwali, you may ask? Well, to have Kelly explain it [girly voice] it’s ada blah blah blah, it’s so super fun and it’s going to be great. [normal voice] Lot of gods with unpronounceable names. Twenty minutes later you find out that is essentially a Hindu Halloween.  					",3,6,36
Michael, Hey. Hey. Stop that. That is offensive. Indians do not eat monkey brains. And if they do… sign me up… because I am sure that they are very tasty and nutritional.   					,3,6,36
Michael," It’s important that this company celebrates its diversity. And you know what, Stanley? Come Kwanzaa time, I have got you covered, baby. ",3,6,36
Michael, Wha? Really? You should! It’s fun.  					,3,6,36
Michael," I love the people here. And if there was one thing I di… don’t really care for is that they can be terribly, terribly ignorant about other cultures. And I don’t want them embarrassing me in front of my girlfriend, Carol.   					",3,6,36
Michael," Diwali is a very important holiday for the Hindus. But, frankly, I’m a little appalled that none of you know very much about Indian culture. So, without further ado, Kelly you are on. ",3,6,36
Michael, Um… why don’t you tell us a little bit about the origins of the holiday.,3,6,36
Michael," All right, all right, all right, all right. This isn’t ‘Lord of the Rings’.  					",3,6,36
Michael," Now, a lot of people say that Kelly is one in a million and that’s true, but it’s also not true. Because, frankly, there are literally billions of people just like Kelly in the world.  Here are some famous Indians. [slide show] Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar. He is a Nobel prize-winning physicist. Impressive. Apu from the Simpsons. Hilarious. Indian. M. Night Shyamalan. ‘The Village’, ‘Unbreakable’, ‘Sixth Sense’, ‘Sig… ‘",3,6,36
Michael," Just stop it. [slide of Michael & Carol kissing] What’s the… oh, whoa! [laughs] Where did that come from?   					",3,6,36
Michael, And another thing about the Indian people… they love sex positions. I present to you the Kama Sutra. I mean look at that. Who’s seen that before? ,3,6,36
Michael," No. This is delightful, charming culture.  					",3,6,36
Michael, My Indian Culture Seminar was going great until Toby decided that he was too immature to deal with culturally explicit images. It’s just sex. People… everybody does it. I’m doing it… with Carol! Probably tonight.   					,3,6,36
Michael, [points at woman] What does that look like to you?,3,6,36
Michael," Hey, Kevin. It’s a costume. Why don’t you just cool it, okay? Carol? Carol.  					",3,6,36
Michael," I’ll have one of those as well. Thank you very much. Now these are limes, lemons, onions… ",3,6,36
Michael, Do you think they have any s’mores?  					,3,6,36
Michael," All they are is chocolate, graham cracker, and marshmallow. How difficult would that have been?  					",3,6,36
Michael," Wow, thirty years? And you two only met once before the wedding night?",3,6,36
Michael," Oh! She’s not a cheerleader. She thought this was a costume party! Um… no, we’re not married… yet!",3,6,36
Michael," She is. Very fair and very kind. So… um… tell me, is your marriage the kind of thing where when you die she has to throw herself on a fire? No? Okay. It’s still very cool. Ok. Thanks!  					",3,6,36
Michael," I’m going to be. [to DJ] Hi, I’m just going to get this for a sec… just a sec. [speaks in microphone] Um… everyone? I’m sorry, could I have your attention, please. Thank you. Ah-hah… Hi. Sorry. I just have an announcement to make. Um… okay. I have learned a lot about Indian culture tonight. But I have learned even more about love. And I know you’re all thinking ‘who is this crazy gringo and what is he talking about?’ Well, I’m not crazy. Maybe I’m crazy in love. So without further ado, Carol? Carol Stills. I would like you to do me the honor of making me your husband. ",3,6,36
Michael," [lowers microphone] Oh, you’ve got to be kidding me. Okay.  					",3,6,36
Michael, No. I get it. I get it. You’re not ready. We’ll wait. This is a classic… ,3,6,36
Michael," Yeah, well, but I … I feel like I’ve known you many lifetimes. Maybe I’m Hindu after all. Okay, I’m not Hindu, but… Carol. Carol, I just… I feel like… I just like you so much.",3,6,36
Michael," Ok. Okay. Good night. [louder] Hey, you know what? Why don’t I come with you. Cause I’ve got this book called the Kama Sutra.",3,6,36
Michael," Wow. Pam. When Carol said ‘No.’ tonight, I think I finally realized how you must be feeling. We are both the victims of broken engagements.",3,6,36
Michael, We’re so alike. So alike. [leans in to kiss her],3,6,36
Michael, [scoffing noises] Can I have a ride home?,3,6,36
Michael, These are not my shoes. This is just like that show ‘Taxi Cab Confessions’.,3,6,36
Michael," This is going out to Indians everywhere. It’s a tribute to one of the greats… Mr. Adam Sandler. [sings] Diwali is a festival of lights. Let me tell you something. Tonight has been one crazy night. So put on your saris, it’s time to celebrate Diwali. Everybody looks so jolly. But it’s not Christmas, it’s Diwali. The goddess of destruction Kali stopped by to celebrate Diwali. Don’t invite any zombies to a celebration of Diwali. Along came Polly to have some fun at Diwali. If you’re Indian and you love to party, have a  happy, happy, happy, happy Diwali. Happy Diwali!",3,6,36
Michael, …thing in the morning. Love to start my morning with a hearty bowl of Jan.,3,7,37
Michael," [singing] Just call me Levinson in the morning, baby.",3,7,37
Michael, Am I a small number person or a severance package person?,3,7,37
Michael," Oh… [burrys head in hands] Oh, my god. Oh, my god! I don’t really get it ’cause we’re not doing that bad and our numbers are gonna come up.",3,7,37
Michael," Oh really, what role is that? King of the stupid universe?  				",3,7,37
Michael," It is an outrage, that’s all. It’s… hey’re making a huge, huge mistake. Let’s see Josh replace these people. Let’s see Josh find another Stanley. You think Stanleys grow on trees? Well they don’t. There is no Stanley tree. Do you think the world is crawling with Phyllises? Show me that farm. With Phyllises and Kevins sprouting up all over the place. Ripe for the plucking. Show me that farm.  				",3,7,37
Michael, Pictures. Memories. [Picks up a framed photo of Stanley’s daughter from Stanley’s desk] Look at that. They grow up so fast.  				,3,7,37
Michael, Don’t say that. That just sounds weird. Please.,3,7,37
Michael," Well… we have nothin to talk about, Dwight. Just do your work … while you still can.  				",3,7,37
Michael," Yeah, great! Amazing. Best physical condition of my life.",3,7,37
Michael," Nothing. Just checking in. I can’t tell you, so…",3,7,37
Michael," Nothing, Pam.[whispers to himself] What difference does it make?  We’ll be gone in a couple of weeks anyway.",3,7,37
Michael," [facing the whole office] Listen up, everybody… I have some news. We are screwed. Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton is being shut down.",3,7,37
Michael," You knew about this all along, didn’t you?",3,7,37
Michael, I don’t know. Probably not. This is the worst.  				,3,7,37
Michael," I know, I know. Well, I’ll land on my feet. Don’t worry about me.",3,7,37
Michael," So, you’ll be okay too. You’re a warrior. You’re smart, capable. You’ll find something else and…",3,7,37
Michael, This is my house. The CFO is taking away my house and giving it to Josh. And Josh is giving the garage to Bob Vance.  				,3,7,37
Michael," All right, listen up. Some of you may have heard some rumors about the branch closing. But, I am not going to take this lying down. I have a plan and I am going to save our jobs. So just hang in there. [Looks at  Dwight] Let’s go.",3,7,37
Michael, Yes. This might get ugly. I need backup.  				,3,7,37
Michael," Go to New York, confront the CFO, show him he’s making a mistake… save the branch.",3,7,37
Michael," Okay, this is it. [runs up the stairs of CFO’s house, with Dwight] This is exactly what Michael Moore does, famous documentarian. He goes up to people with a camera and he’s like “Why did you do this? Why did you pollute? You are bad. You’re a bad person.” It’s very dramatic.  Although, I can’t say I was a big fan of  ‘Bowling for Columbine’, because I thought it was going to be a bowling movie, like ‘Kingpin’. And it wasn’t. It was something else.  				",3,7,37
Michael, I will improvise. I will speak from the heart.,3,7,37
Michael," Yes, but these are employees, Sir. These are human beings.",3,7,37
Michael," [no longer talking to Dwight as Wallace] Stop… stop it! Just, okay. He’s not going to say any of that.",3,7,37
Michael," Because he’d be intimidated and I, just… let’s start again. Just be more scared of me, okay?",3,7,37
Michael, [takes bottle and cleans off cap with his tie]  				,3,7,37
Michael," No, not until I have some good news for them. Not until I have some good news.  				",3,7,37
Michael, What if this doesn’t work? What is the office actually goes under?,3,7,37
Michael," [pats Dwight and sighs] All right, favorite moments in Dunder-Mifflin history. Go.",3,7,37
Michael," Oh, right. Okay, that’s enough. That’s good.",3,7,37
Michael," Oh, hmm, all of them. I loved them all. Every single one. ",3,7,37
Michael, What are we still doing here? It’s over. Let’s go home. Get the car.,3,7,37
Michael," Oh, this was such a stupid idea! This was so stupid. I am such a stupid idiot. I let everybody down. Everybody hates me. I lost everybody’s jobs. Nobody likes me anymore!",3,7,37
Michael, Right here! Right here! [pounds his chest against Dwight’s],3,7,37
Michael, Karen Filip… [In Italian voice] Ka-ren Fili-pell-li.,3,8,38
Michael," My branch is absorbing the Stamford branch. Or, as I like to put it, my family is doubling in size. That’s all I’m going to say about it because I have a gigantic performance ahead of me. And I have to get into my head and focus. [exhales]  ",3,8,38
Michael, I’m not firing somebody on the first day.,3,8,38
Michael," Got the food? Good! Looky-looky-looky. What I want you to do… set it up in the conference room, please. Make it look nice. As if you are trying to impress a much older man who’s way out of your league.",3,8,38
Michael, Ah! Ding-ding-ding-ding-ding. Our first arrival. Welcome to Scranton. This is Hannah Smoterich-Barr.,3,8,38
Michael, Welcome to our humble abode. Follow me to your desk. Your ball and chain is right over here.   ,3,8,38
Michael," You know for a lot of these people this is the only family they have. So…  As far as I’m concerned, [holds up WORLD’S BEST BOSS mug] this says ‘World’s Best Dad’.  ",3,8,38
Michael, Ah! There he is Tony… what’s your last name? ,3,8,38
Michael, Gardner! I knew that. There you go. Gift bag… for you. [laughs] Okay.,3,8,38
Michael," Well, they’re just for guests. If there are any left over, you can buy one later.",3,8,38
Michael," Wh..and coupons… to various hot spots around Scranton. [to Tony] All right! Let me show you to your area, sir. Come on, big guy.",3,8,38
Michael," Welcome, welcome, welcome! [in robot voice] Take me to your leader. Oh wait, I am your leader.",3,8,38
Michael," Mmm… dah. I am actually your boss, Michael Scott. Welcome. Wow! You are very exotic looking. Was your dad a G.I. or uh?  ",3,8,38
Michael, Ah! You must be Andy Bernard. Aloha and welcome!,3,8,38
Michael," A-ha-ha-ho. Very good! Welcome to our little kingdom. Ah, we have a bag of nifty gifties for you.",3,8,38
Michael, They are nifty! They’re nifty gifties.  ,3,8,38
Michael, You know who I really like? Is this guy Andy Bernard. He has got this very likable way about him.  ,3,8,38
Michael," [to Jim] No way. Get him out of here. We don’t want any of this kind in here. Good to see you, man.",3,8,38
Michael," [to Martin] How are you? Martin Nash, I presume? This is a little gift bag for you.",3,8,38
Michael," Free of charge. Follow me, I will show you where all the slaves work. [shakes head] Not… so, your desk is… ",3,8,38
Michael, [talking to himself] I present the orientation video.,3,8,38
Michael, I told you the titles are irrelevant. They just relate to pay scale.,3,8,38
Michael," It is not a matter of more or less. Your pay is just different. Okay? All right! Show time, part one.",3,8,38
Michael," I don’t care! Dwight! You all report to me! That’s all that matters! The rest of it just work out amongst yourselves, ok?",3,8,38
Michael," Please! I have a company to run. Well, you let me run the company?",3,8,38
Michael," Okay. Everybody settled in? Good. Why don’t we all proceed in to the conference room? Or, should I say, the banquet hall. For… drum roll, please [makes drum roll noises], the official Merger Day All-Family Welcome Breakfast. Come on in!   ",3,8,38
Michael," Nope. Um… for the guests it is. For you, consider it cow-meat. Strictly taboo. ",3,8,38
Michael," Well, then… consider it poisoned beef. No touchy.",3,8,38
Michael," No, it’s not beef… just… sit down, please. [talks to group] Welcome. Help yourself.",3,8,38
Michael," Wrong. Toby, this is an orientation not a borientation.[talks to group] Okay. Do not worry. All of your questions are about to be answered. Cell phones and pagers off, please.",3,8,38
Michael, Let’s face it. Moving to a new job can be very stressful. So I have made an orientation video especially for you newcomers. But it’s not like any orientation video that any of you have ever seen. It’s funny. It’s got a little bit of a zing to it and I hope that it gives you a flavor of what we’re all about here at Dunder Mifflin. And what we’re all about here in Scranton. So let’s just all laugh together and watch “Lazy Scranton”.  ,3,8,38
Michael," Sittin’ in my office with a plate of grilled bacon, call my man Dwight just to see what was shakin’.",3,8,38
Michael, The Electric City. Call poison control if you’re bit by a spider.,3,8,38
Michael, [in video] I am so scared… when people don’t label their personal food.  ,3,8,38
Michael," You like coal mines and you wanna see ’em, Well, check it out, yo, the Anthracite Museum! Plenty of space in the parking lot,",3,8,38
Michael, [on video in background] Spot. Scranton. What? The Electric City. Scranton.What? The Electric City. Scranton. What?,3,8,38
Michael," Well, so far, I think it is killin’. I thought it would either be an ‘A’ or an ‘A+’ but I completely forgot that there’s an ‘A++’.  ",3,8,38
Michael, People hate people that are different from them. That’s natural. But you know what makes people forget their differences?  A great show. That is why I created the ‘Integration Celebration’. This is the moment when Scranton and Stamford come together as one. United in applause.   ,3,8,38
Michael," I know what a lot of you must be thinking. ‘Wow! What a day! Feels more like a night at a party than a day at work.’ Well, in my opinion, business should feel like a night out. A night… at… the Roxbury. Okay. There’s supposed to be music and it’s… I got it, I got it! I got it. Dwight! Just. ",3,8,38
Michael, You me? You me? Me you? You! You! You me! Bow Bow Bow!,3,8,38
Michael," You me? You me? Me you me! You! You! You me you! You! Oh my nose so itchy, why’s my nose so itchy!",3,8,38
Michael," [laughs hysterically] Okay, I told you these guys had a sense of humor.",3,8,38
Michael, Why are the new people on the table? To show them that we are not above them. ,3,8,38
Michael, Not today. No. Tony! Please join your cohorts on the table if you would. ,3,8,38
Michael," Oh, well. Just use the momentum of your lower half to hoist yourself up. ",3,8,38
Michael, Come on. We’re doing this thing! Let’s get up.,3,8,38
Michael," Bend at the knees. Okay, here we go. Here we go. I’m under this… I’m under this hock here. I don’t know what I’m grabbing here.",3,8,38
Michael," You can’t quit! On the first day. That’s [deep voice] heresy, my friend! [regular voice] Okay, let’s talk about this. What happened? I mean, what… Was it Toby? Did he say something? Cause he’s… what?",3,8,38
Michael, My management style? So… didn’t you think ‘Lazy Scranton’ was funny?,3,8,38
Michael," Okay. Well, don’t bother quitting because you’re fired.",3,8,38
Michael," You are fired! I’m sorry, but we don’t have quitters on this team! Just clean out your desk!",3,8,38
Michael," Don’t try to apologize to me, man! It’s too late. Just get out! Take your bad vibes with you.",3,8,38
Michael," Probably the best advice you ever gave me, Dwight.",3,8,38
Michael," Whoa, Angela! Hold on. Hooters is a restaurant. With over 400 locations worldwide. ",3,8,38
Michael, No. We do have to get along. Can’t we all just get along? Or have we forgotten the words of the Reverend King.  ,3,8,38
Michael," The word merger comes from the word marriage. And that was what today was supposed to be. The loving union between people. Instead, it has become like when my Mom moved in with Jeff. And once again, it becomes my job to fix it.  ",3,8,38
Michael," Hey! Hey, everybody! Something happened! Those guys from Vance Refrigeration, they let the air out of our tires.",3,8,38
Michael, Yeah! They punk’d us! They punk’d us good! Come on. Come on!,3,8,38
Michael," Man, they got us so bad. We cannot let them get away with this. We have got to pull together as one and steal their refrigerators. ",3,8,38
Michael, Why? I will tell you why. Because they saved the worst for me. They put a hate note under my windshield wiper. Check this out. It’s so hateful. [reads note] “You guys SUCK! You can never pull together as one and revenge us. That is why you SUCK!”,3,8,38
Michael," No. No, no, no. No.  You are falling for it. You’re playing right into their hands. This is just what they want you to do. Don’t, oh… ",3,8,38
Michael, THIS IS EGREGIOUS! This is egregious!  ,3,8,38
Michael," See that? Mission accomplished. Like a bunch of fourth graders. Sometimes, what brings the kids together is hating the lunch lady. Although that’ll change. Because, by the end of the fourth grade, the lunch lady was actually the person I hung out with the most. [answers phone] Jell-o! ",3,8,38
Michael, I did. Major personnel crises averted. Compliment accepted.,3,8,38
Michael, But do you realize that that was actually Dwight’s idea? Bad advice from my Number Two.,3,8,38
Michael," Yes, I know that. For, I do read the memos.   ",3,8,38
Michael," So after a great deal of thought and introspective-shun, I have decided to make Jim my new Number Two. ",3,8,38
Michael," Thank you, Andy. That’s… very kind. Thanks.",3,8,38
Michael, Shut it! That’s… [whispers to camera] suck up!  ,3,8,38
Michael," [climbs under desk] Hey, look at me, I’m a baby! I’m one of those babies from “Look Who’s Talking.” What am I thinking? [Laughs] Look at all those staplers! What’s a stapler!? I don’t even know, I’m a baby! Hey, Mom, I’m thirsty! I’m thirsty, Mama! I want some milk. And you know where milk comes from! Breasts.  				",3,9,39
Michael," Yeah, Jan, it um… looks like a check, piece of paper of some sort. Receipt. I don’t know.",3,9,39
Michael, I didn’t hire an ex-convict. Unless they mean Toby. Convicted rapist. [Jan sighs] … I’m just kidding.,3,9,39
Michael," Hey Jan, speaking of Stamford, Hannah brought in her baby.",3,9,39
Michael, Stop it. Stop it right-stop it right now.,3,9,39
Michael, Why did the convict have to be a black guy? It is such a stereotype. I just wish that Josh had made a more progressive choice. Like a white guy… who went to prison for… polluting a black guy’s lake.  				,3,9,39
Michael," In our society, a black man can be arrested for almost anything. He was probably at a sporting event and… saw some people pushing each other, and he intervened.",3,9,39
Michael," Sssssso, what we need to do… is to forget about this whole Martin in prison thing. People will draw unfair conclusions about Martin and or black people.",3,9,39
Michael, Good. All right. [everyone leaves]  				,3,9,39
Michael," Um… Martin, from Stamford, was, at one time, in prison. [Dwight starts to run] No. Dwight! Be cool! Be cool!  				",3,9,39
Michael," Ah. Good good. Good. Just a second. Everybody? May I have your attention please? I realize that a lot of you have already heard that Martin here has had some trouble with the law, but I just want to declare publicly that I… trust… him, completely, and that anybody who doesn’t is an ignorant, dumb… person. Okay? As a matter of fact, you show me a white man you trust and I will show you a black man that I trust even more. Pam. Tell me a white person you trust.",3,9,39
Michael," Close your eyes. Picture a convict. What’s he wearing? Nothing special, baseball cap on backwards, baggy pants… he says something ordinary like… ‘yo, thats shizzle.’ Okay. Now slowly open your eyes again. Who are you picturing? A black man? Wrong. That was a white woman. Surprised? Well, shame on you.   				",3,9,39
Michael, No. That’s not cool. You don’t have to tell them. ,3,9,39
Michael, This place is not prison. It’s… way better than prison.  				,3,9,39
Michael," Okay! Listen up everybody! Um, you guys said that prison was better than this place, and I heard ya, loud and clear, so, I am instituting some changes to make this more like prison. We are going to start with an hour of outdoor time. So let’s go!   				",3,9,39
Michael, Why don’t we… pump some iron? Anyone wanna… pump up? ,3,9,39
Michael," It’s uh… two and a half. I’m not going for bulk, I’m going for tone. ",3,9,39
Michael," Yeah, it’s… freaking cold out here. Anybody wants to stay out, you’ve got about… twenty-seven minutes of rec time.   				",3,9,39
Michael, Oh heyyy. Martiiin. You have TV in the joint?,3,9,39
Michael, These people don’t realize how lucky they are. This office is the American Dream. And they would rather be in the hole.  				,3,9,39
Michael," All right everybody, there has been a lot of name calling against our office today. Corporate maligning, slurring, much of it coming from one of you, who claims that prison is better… than… here. And none of can say “Boo” because none of us have ever been to prison. Well, there’s somebody I’d like you to meet. Somebody else who has been to prison, who can tell you what it is really like [puts on bandanna]. I’m prison Mike! You know why they call me prison Mike?!",3,9,39
Michael," Do you really expect me to not push you up against the wall, beeyotch?! [employees protest] All right, hey, hey, hey, hey, that’s just the way we talk in the clink. Been a lot of fun talk about prison today, but I am here to scare you straight. I AM HERE TO SCARE YOU STRAIIIGHT!! In prison you are somebody’s bitch. Oh, and you. [points to Ryan] You, my friend, would be da belle of da ball. Don’t drop the soap! Don’t drop the soap!",3,9,39
Michael," And prison. Eh, fifty-fifty, both. Look, prison stinks, is what I’m saying. It’s not like you can go home, and, recharge your batteries, and come back in the morning and, be with your friends, having fun in the office. ",3,9,39
Michael, I stole. … And I robbed. And I kidnapped… the… president’s son. And held him for ransom.,3,9,39
Michael," Gruel. Sandwiches. Gruel omelettes. Nothing but gruel. Plus, you can eat your own hair.",3,9,39
Michael," Yeah. Yeah. Well, thank you, Andy. Tanks.",3,9,39
Michael," The worst thing about prison was the… was the Dementors. They… were flying all over the place, and they were scary. And they’d come down, and they’d suck the soul out of your body, and it hurt!",3,9,39
Michael," No, not Harry Potter. … There are no movies in prison. This is my point! You guys got it soft, and cushy! This place is freaking awesome! The people are awesome! Your boss is nice! Everyone seems to get along! People are tolerant! People who… have jumped to conclusions can redeem themselves! Nobody is nobody’s bitch. I hope that this scared you. And from me, Prison Mike, to you, I just wanna thank you for listening to me. Letting me be a part of your life today. ‘Cause you got a good life! YOu got a good life. A good life. [turns around, takes bandanna off] So. What do you think? It doesn’t sound so great, does it?",3,9,39
Michael," Okay. Okay, fine. You guys think prison is so great? All right. Well, here you go. [locks employees in conference room]",3,9,39
Michael," No! If you think is prison is so wonderful, then, enjoy prison! They are such babies. I am going to leave them in there until they can appreciate what it’s like to have freedom. And if this doesn’t bother them, then I am out of ideas.  				",3,9,39
Michael," They were very disrespectful to me, and to the office. And Martin has had a bad influence, to think that I gave him the benefit of the doubt.",3,9,39
Michael," Okay. You know what Toby? I am teaching them a lesson, so.",3,9,39
Michael," [unlocks door] Okay nutcases, get out of there! Good work. Long day. Really long. Why don’t you guys head home. Early. Time off for good behavior! Heh. Good job. Enjoy your freedoms!  				",3,9,39
Michael," Martin went from being a new guy from Stamford… to a convict, to… my friend. Back to a convict. Then to… a kind of a nuisance, actually, to be completely honest. And finally, to… a quitter. And I will not miss him. And that is not because he is black.   				",3,9,39
Michael," [Riding a bicycle down the hallway and singing] Deck the halls with boughs of holly. Fa la la la la la la la la. [Struggling to stay on] ‘Tis the … ack. [expletive] Hey! [to Pam] I would like a nice slice of Christmas Pam. Side of candied Pams. And perhaps, some Pam-chops, with mint… ",3,10,40
Michael," OK…  Well, I need to put this bike in there. I hope it’ll fit, with all these little knickknacks.",3,10,40
Michael," Well, that is probably from the test drive.",3,10,40
Michael," Oh, thanks. [Michael and Andy do a fist bump and explosion.]",3,10,40
Michael," Yes? [Pam holds up a bag] Oh Pam, that is so sweet. You didn’t have to do that. ",3,10,40
Michael," This is going to be the best Christmas ever. My girlfriend Carol is coming to our party tonight, and I have a little surprise for her. [singing] I’ve got two tickets to paradise! Pack your bags, we’re leaving the day-after-tomorrow! Um,  taking her to Sandals, Jamaica, all-inclusive. All-inclusive. You know what that means? Right? Yeah.  					",3,10,40
Michael, There she is. A Christmas Carol. Hello [kisses Carol] You’re about five hours early to the party. You’re such a blonde. [laughs] ,3,10,40
Michael," Hey, everybody. I don’t know who you haven’t met yet, but I think this is one of them. This is my girlfriend – Carol. This is just the front of her. Show ’em, show ’em the other side. ",3,10,40
Michael," Turn around, turn around. Come on. [making a body turning gesture]",3,10,40
Michael, Not as much as I need a moment alone with you. [puts finger on her back and reaches for her butt] Berp.  					,3,10,40
Michael," That is my Christmas card. It’s a picture of you and me and your kids on a ski trip, having a blast. Ski-sons Greetings. ",3,10,40
Michael," Yes, but what you didn’t realize at the time was that I was with you in a sense. I was in your heart… ",3,10,40
Michael," No, no no no Ok, OK, You know what, you’re not thinking straight. You know what you need? You need to think this through in [making drum noise] Jamaica’s largest fresh water pool. ",3,10,40
Michael," I got us tickets to Sandals, Jamaica, We leave day after tomorrow. [Carol shakes head in disappointment]. You better find the skimpiest bikini there is. ",3,10,40
Michael," No, Carol. You walk out that door and it is over. ",3,10,40
Michael, I’d like everybody’s attention. Christmas is canceled. ,3,10,40
Michael, Keep it up Stanley and you will lose New Year’s. ,3,10,40
Michael," Jim, take New Year’s away from Stanley.",3,10,40
Michael, Carol and I split up. Amicably. And I just don’t think it would be appropriate to celebrate under the circumstances. ,3,10,40
Michael, Fine! [everybody stops talking] Have your party. Just no guests. ,3,10,40
Michael," Well, you know what Phyllis? All of your guests would have probably canceled at the last minute anyway, leaving your life a stupid rotten mess.  					",3,10,40
Michael, It hurts my heart. It hurts my stomach. It hurts my arms.,3,10,40
Michael, [moves a little] Thanks. How did you push away the bad thoughts?,3,10,40
Michael," Like maybe, the real reason they left was because there were things they wanted you to do in bed, that were, foreign, and scary?",3,10,40
Michael, And not that you didn’t want to try them. Some wine may have helped. Do you know what I’m referring to?,3,10,40
Michael," Hey, would you like to go to Sandals, Jamaica with me? ",3,10,40
Michael, What are you doing? [“Goodbye My Lover” by James Blunt plays],3,10,40
Michael, I don’t have to buy it. I just want to taste it. I just… I just want a little taste of it. ,3,10,40
Michael, [singing] Goodbye my lover. Goodbye my friend. [hits repeat again]   					,3,10,40
Michael," This is an old adage, but they say when you find true love, you know within the first 24 hours. With Carol, I knew within the first 24 minutes of the second day I met her.  					",3,10,40
Michael, All right. Nothing here to distract myself with anyway.,3,10,40
Michael," Ah, I need my entourage [both exit Michael’s office] Jim. Dwight. Ryan. C’mon, we’re going to Asian Hooters. ",3,10,40
Michael, Bros before hos. Why? Because your bros are always there for you. They have got your back after your ho rips your heart out for no good reason. And you were nothing but great to your ho and you told her she was the only ho for you. And that she was better than all the other hos in the world. And then … and then suddenly she’s not yo’ ho no mo’.  					,3,10,40
Michael," Dwight, just, just leave them alone please. They’re on a date. They look very happy. ",3,10,40
Michael, She would get this little foam mustache… ,3,10,40
Michael," And I used to say “Hey, got latte?” And she’d say, that’s not funny. ",3,10,40
Michael, She totally got me. She understood that we didn’t have to laugh to enjoy —,3,10,40
Michael," I’m already starting to forget what color eyes she had. I can’t, OK, I’m gonna call her. I am gonna call and find out… ",3,10,40
Michael," Oh, sure you would. Look at you, I bet you break up with a guy every hour. [Cindy laughs and walks away]",3,10,40
Michael, I don’t know. No one can hear me. You know what? Start the party. ,3,10,40
Michael," Ahh, damn this chicken is good. My compliments to the chef. [points to chef] Which is you! Right? Hahahaha. Awesome! I need some meat. I want some steak. [leans over to neighboring man’s plate] I see steak. ",3,10,40
Michael," Excuse me [tries to take away meat with chopsticks] Ah, un guard. [Fights with chopsticks and laughs] Family style. ",3,10,40
Michael, [laughing] I don’t know what he’s doing.,3,10,40
Michael, We should invite them to the Christmas party.,3,10,40
Michael," Oh, you are such mench my friend. [They stand up and do fist bump and explosion]  					",3,10,40
Michael," OK, where is everybody? I would like them to meet my new girlfriend. [Guys walk in with two different waitresses from Benihana’s]",3,10,40
Michael, The least I could do was give some poor sick kid a bike.,3,10,40
Michael," Nah, you rock. Tell you what, if you want it, it’s yours.",3,10,40
Michael, Oh. [She whispers in his ear. Michael starts to laugh] That’s what she said.   					,3,10,40
Michael, Hello? I would like everybody to meet my new girlfriend. ,3,10,40
Michael," [whispers] The giant baby. Wow, I am so sorry, I had no idea this party would be so lame.",3,10,40
Michael," Oh, party in the break room! Let’s go, let’s go! Thank God! Let’s go to the break room. ",3,10,40
Michael," I just think there are two, two specific kinds of people in the world. People who own houses and people who own condos. [turns to reach for pretzel while Second Cindy turns other direction] And… my question to you [points and pulls away other waitress] is do you agree? ",3,10,40
Michael, Do you agree about what? [laughs] Wow. You’re  lucky you’re so darn cute. ,3,10,40
Michael, Check her out. My little gal over there. Babe-alectable.,3,10,40
Michael, It’s… it’s one of those two. [points at both],3,10,40
Michael," Yeah… well, it’s been hard, they’re wearing the exact same uniform. And I’ve been drinking. And you know how all waitresses look alike.  					",3,10,40
Michael, I honestly don’t see what the big deal is. Stevie Wonder is married. Are you going to tell me that Stevie Wonder doesn’t love his wife just because he’s not sure what she looks like?  					,3,10,40
Michael," Hey. Where’s my girl? Is she in the fridge? Where is she hiding? I don’t know where she is. ‘Cause I’m drunk, I can’t even find her. ",3,10,40
Michael," Haha, I do! I just haven’t hugged you in awhile [marks Cindy’s arm with a black marker]",3,10,40
Michael," Oh, good. That felt good. Let’s go. Party.  					",3,10,40
Michael," No, no, no. Hey, you should stay because we are having fun and… ",3,10,40
Michael," I… you know what? I, OK, listen. I like you. I really like you. So much in fact, that I would like you to accompany me on a trip to Sandals, Jamaica. ",3,10,40
Michael, Don’t make fun… You’re making fun of me. ,3,10,40
Michael," I guess, I didn’t know her very well. I marked her arm. ",3,10,40
Michael," I, I put a mark on her arm. [Both are laughing] So I could tell them apart. I don’t… I know, I know. I can’t believe I gave her my bike!",3,10,40
Michael," I totally rebounded. Someone else shoots and I take the ball and I score. Well, I guess I didn’t score and I’m not sure who’s actually shooting, but, whatever. Doesn’t matter. It’s all good. Or as my ex might say. Domo arigato, Mr. Scott-o.  					",3,10,40
Michael," [on phone] Yes, I just wanted to see if, uh you would like to come to Jamaica with me. There’s this resort called Sandals. Really? OK. All right. I promise you won’t be disappointed. Umm, It’s all-inclusive…   					",3,10,40
Michael," Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Relax. ",3,11,41
Michael," Just relax, OK? I’ll get to all of it later. ",3,11,41
Michael, Aren’t you going to ask me how Jamaica was? Say it. Ask me.,3,11,41
Michael," Stanley. You know what? It is really good to see you, too.",3,11,41
Michael," OK, well payroll is in charge of all that.",3,11,41
Michael," Well, I am just getting settled in. So, I’m gonna… ",3,11,41
Michael, You are not as much fun as your Jamaican brothers… mon.  ,3,11,41
Michael," Feelin’ hot, hot, hot! [playing conch shell] Feelin’ hot, hot, hot! Feelin’ hot, hot, hot! Feelin’ hot, hot, hot! That’s all I know so far, but I’m gonna keep practicing. ",3,11,41
Michael," You know, I had never been out of the country before now?",3,11,41
Michael," Got to see how Jamaicans live. It is great, you know. They just relax, they party all the time. ",3,11,41
Michael," Yeah… Gosh. Great. You know what, Pam? Make a note. I want us all to start having pina coladas every day at three.",3,11,41
Michael, I specifically went on vacation so I would miss it.  ,3,11,41
Michael," Inventory is boring. In the islands, they don’t make you do stuff like take inventory. Why do you think so many businesses move to the Caymans?   ",3,11,41
Michael," Tonight, we are going to have an inventory luau. I want to bring back a little slice of paradise to the Dunder Mifflin warehouse inventory. So, Party Planning Committee, get on it. ",3,11,41
Michael, The Jamaicans don’t have a word for “impossible.”,3,11,41
Michael," How hard is a luau? All you need are some grass skirts, pineapple, poi, tiki torches, suckling pig, some fire dancers. That’s all you need.  ",3,11,41
Michael," Come on in. Settle in. Settling. Settling… and settled. Good, there is something I would like to show everybody. See this sign? [points to a TV monitor of a picture from Jamaica and reads] “No Shirt, No Shoes, No Problem.” This is an attitude I would like all of you to have right here. So what, if we have to stay late to do inventory? No problem.",3,11,41
Michael," No, no, no. No, that’s a German woman named Urkel Grue.  ",3,11,41
Michael," Jan told me to play it cool and not tell anybody because it can get us both in trouble. So officially, I did not see her. But I did see Jan there. In our room. At night. And in the morning. That’s all I’m gonna say. Sex. We had sex. I had sex with her. I had sex with Jan.  ",3,11,41
Michael, [on phone] Hey dude. I just got back from Jamaica. ,3,11,41
Michael," Yeah, that sounds amazing. You know what? The lady Jan Levinson wanted to go to Montego Bay. ",3,11,41
Michael," Well I’m looking at a photo, right now. And I’m telling ‘ya, could be in Maxim. ",3,11,41
Michael," OK. Well, check this out. I am sending you some email. You got it?",3,11,41
Michael," OK, wait a second. I sent it to you at… [reading computer screen] ",3,11,41
Michael," That’s great, OK. Um, so did you get an email from me?",3,11,41
Michael," OK. Well, that was supposed to go to Packer, not “packaging.” Did you already, um, forward to a whole bunch of people? ",3,11,41
Michael," OK. Um, well, did you get the second email that I sent? Explaining that the first email was a mistake and that you should delete it. ",3,11,41
Michael," A sensitive email has been released to the office. It contains a file, a picture. The file name is “Jamaican Jan Sun Princess.”",3,11,41
Michael," That photo is my personal property and if you are telling me you went on my computer and stole that photo, then I am going to call the cops. ",3,11,41
Michael, This is probably the icebreaker you need. ,3,11,41
Michael," I bet you would love all the details, wouldn’t you? Skeevy little perv.",3,11,41
Michael," No, no, no. I am not dating Jan. She was very clear about that. Just two like souls having a romantic time in the most romantic place on earth. Got enough, weirdo?",3,11,41
Michael," Oh, God, no. No, no! Hang up! Hang up! Tell her I’m not here. Tell… tell her, I ran out for cash. I hit a deer. I hit a deer with my car. Tell her I hit a cat. Tell her I hit a cat.",3,11,41
Michael, All right. [continued clapping and cheering for Michael],3,11,41
Michael," Hello. Hi. Attention everyone. Um, apparently, there is an email circulating around that contains a very PG-13 rating picture of me and a woman—",3,11,41
Michael," My point is that, if you get it, I would ask that you just delete it. Sight unseen. Let’s be professional, all right?  ",3,11,41
Michael," Feelin’… feelin’ hot, hot, hot! [plays conch shell]",3,11,41
Michael," And I, to you, in addition, feel the same feelings that you are as well. ",3,11,41
Michael," So, umm… thanks for coming by. So, I, uh… ",3,11,41
Michael," Well thanks for coming over, I appreciate – [Jan leans over and kisses Michael passionately]",3,11,41
Michael," Sorry, oh wow, that’s so rude. I’m sorry, I can’t control him.",3,12,42
Michael," Dwight, care to join us, finally? Thank you.",3,12,42
Michael," Yes. Ok, here is the dream team. My sales dream team. Today we are going to team up for sales calls. Andy, since this was your idea, you get to pick first.",3,12,42
Michael," Well, I appreciate that. That is very gracious of you. ",3,12,42
Michael," Well, thank you sir. Ok, now going by seniority. Phyllis, our resident senior.",3,12,42
Michael," Good. Next up, Superfly himself, Stanley.",3,12,42
Michael, You can’t pass. You’ve got to pick somebody.,3,12,42
Michael," Long story. All right everybody, circle up. Here we go. You know what this is? This is the “Amazing Race.” [To Ryan and Stanley] And you guys are the retired marines. [To Phyllis and Karen] And you guys are the mother and daughter. [To Dwight and Jim] And you guys are the gay couple. And we are the firefighter heroes. Are we ready to go?",3,12,42
Michael," No, we’re just going to rush out, do the sales thing, and come back. ",3,12,42
Michael," It’s just… brrrrrr… It’s “Amazing Race,” Phyllis. Okay? We’re in teams of two and we are on a mission. All right, so, on your mark, get set, go. Let’s do it.",3,12,42
Michael," Ugh… that is a long story. Um, couple of months ago, Dwight tried to go behind my back with Jan and get my job and I am now having him do my laundry as punishment. ",3,12,42
Michael, [Walks out of the Ladies’ Restroom] Let’s go. The men’s room was disgusting.   				,3,12,42
Michael," Hey, did you catch that up at Lake Wallenpaupack?",3,12,42
Michael," You know, I used to go up there all the time with my step-dad, and I never caught anything that big. ",3,12,42
Michael," You know what? Let’s get right down to it. Dunder-Mifflin may be just two rooms and a warehouse, but what we lack in flash, we will make up for with hardwork and decency. ",3,12,42
Michael," I think what Andy is trying to express is that while we have the resources of a large company, we will give you the care and attention of a small company. ",3,12,42
Michael, Stop it. [Puts his hand on Andy’s shoulder] Stop it. ,3,12,42
Michael, I don’t know. Who knows how words are formed.   				,3,12,42
Michael," No, you are remembering it wrong.   				",3,12,42
Michael," Dwight betrayed me once before. So this is his strike two. You know what they say? Fool me once, strike one. But fool me twice, strike three.   				",3,12,42
Michael," I know that you went to corporate this morning, and I know that you lied about it. And given our history, I need you tell me this instant exactly what you were doing. ",3,12,42
Michael," Ok, you know what? I want you to think about your future in this company. I want you to think about it long and hard.",3,12,42
Michael, Don’t. Don’t you dare. I want to know what you were doing this morning by the end of the day.   				,3,12,42
Michael," Yes, Dwight Schrute has left this company. More personnel turnover.",3,13,43
Michael," Yes, well. It is a big loss. Dwight was the top salesman… ",3,13,43
Michael, What does that even mean? That is impossible.,3,13,43
Michael," But, there is some good news. Oscar is back. Addition by addition. So we are going to have a big party today to welcome him back and hopefully that will lift everybody’s spirits.  ",3,13,43
Michael, Wow. [walks over to the plant] What is wrong with this thing? It looks terrible.,3,13,43
Michael, Yeah. And you know what? Ask them about the toys on my desk too. They always used to arrange them in a very pleasing way. It used to brighten my morning.,3,13,43
Michael, Really? That was very nice of him. We need more attitude like that around the office. ,3,13,43
Michael," Love that Andy, right? Solid fellow. Seems smart enough. Likes me a lot. A lot. Too much. Like a crazy person. A little. Not super crazy… just… there’s something about him that creeps me out. I can’t really explain it. He’s always up in my bidness. Which is ebonics for “being in my face and annoying the bejesus out of me.” I don’t understand how someone could have so little self-awareness.  ",3,13,43
Michael," No, hey, hey. Don’t be ridiculous. Of course we are going to have a party. A celebration of Oscar. Oscar night. And I want it to be Oscar-specific. ",3,13,43
Michael," No, no, no. I mean, not because you’re gay. Your gayness does not define you. Your Mexican-ness is what defines you to me. And I think we should celebrate Oscar’s Mexicanity. So Phyllis… I want you to go find firecrackers. And a Chihuahua. Pam, in the frozen food section, Swanson makes a delightful chimichanga.",3,13,43
Michael," Ah, a burro, of course. If Oscar wants a donkey, let’s get him one.   ",3,13,43
Michael, Who’s that sportscaster that bit that lady? Marv something? Andy is like Marv Something. Great sportscaster. Big weirdo creep.   ,3,13,43
Michael, Hey guys. How’s the workload on all of Dwight’s old accounts? Handling it okay?,3,13,43
Michael," Yes, he did. Have any of you talked to Dwight? ",3,13,43
Michael," Don’t – don’t do that. That’s not nice. What about you, Phyllis? You and Dwight were close.",3,13,43
Michael, Why would Dwight do that for you? I think I know why. Because Dwight loves this company.,3,13,43
Michael, Do you think that anyone else out there would have driven to corporate for you?,3,13,43
Michael," Pam, I have a mission to accomplish. Make sure this party gets rolling and I will be back shortly.",3,13,43
Michael," No, just stop. Stop. Stop doing it. You’re going to drive me crazy.",3,13,43
Michael, Um. It takes a big man to admit his mistake. And I am that big man. Angela from accounting told me what you did. ,3,13,43
Michael," Yes, she did. And Dwight, if you were willing to do something like that for some random co-worker, then clearly I have misjudged you from the beginning, and I apologize.",3,13,43
Michael," So, maybe you should come back. You should come back. Please. ",3,13,43
Michael, We can talk about that. [Dwight high fives Michael] All right.  ,3,13,43
Michael, Ladies and gentlemen! May I present… Mr. Dwight Schrute!,3,13,43
Michael," Okay, Dwight, you can let go of her hand. You’re gonna break it. [looks around the room] Not bad, huh?",3,13,43
Michael, Pam. I will shake mine and then you will shake yours.  ,3,13,43
Michael, So does this remind you of your childhood right now?  ,3,13,43
Michael," Wow. Thank you. Wow, that’s– thanks so much.  ",3,13,43
Michael," And now, ladies and gentlemen, the big finale! Sir, would you do the honor? [hands broom to Dwight, though Oscar thinks he’s handing it to him]",3,13,43
Michael, It takes a big man to admit his mistake and that’s what I did. The important thing is I learned something. I don’t want somebody sucking up to me because they think I’m going to help their career. I want them sucking up to me because they genuinely love me. Hmm.  ,3,13,43
Michael," How, would you stop interrupting please?  ",3,14,44
Michael," Yesterday I was scraping some gunk off my wall sockets with a metal fork and I gave myself the nastiest shock.  And when I came to, I had an epiphery.  Life is precious.  And if I die I want my son to know the dealio.  The dealio of life.  ",3,14,44
Michael, Here are some things that I want to teach you that your mother won’t be able to.    ,3,14,44
Michael," To jump start a car, first pop the hood.  Then you take these bad boys and clip them anywhere on the engine.  Then you take these and clip them wherever.   ",3,14,44
Michael," Number eight, learn how to take off a woman’s bra.",3,14,44
Michael, [Dwight is wearing a bra] You just twist your hand until something breaks.,3,14,44
Michael, Well you get the picture.  Thanks Pam.  ,3,14,44
Michael," And remember no matter what, I will always love you.",3,14,44
Michael," You know what, Dwight, do you want to do this, or no?",3,14,44
Michael," Hello everyone!  As you know, we are six days away from Phyllis’ wedding.  [Applause] So get your suits to the dry cleaner and get your hair did.  And Karen, um, you might want to invest in a dress or a skirt of some kind if you don’t already have one.  This may be Phyllis’ only wedding ever.  It is my job to ensure that none of you look like ragamuffins.  So I am instituting prima nocta.  ",3,14,44
Michael, I’m sorry.  I had a very different understanding as to what prima nocta meant.  ,3,14,44
Michael," I’m trying to get everyone excited about Phyllis’ wedding because I want her to get people excited about my wedding when the time comes.  Which won’t be hard, because it’s going to be awesome.  A lot better than hers, that’s for sure.  It’ll probably be on a boat.  ",3,14,44
Michael," No problem.  The guys are having a little shindig of their own in the warehouse.  From 2:30 to 3:15.  It is the only time that Bob was available.  Sort of a guy’s night out.  A G-N-O if you will.  A Gah-No.  Actually, it’s more of a guy’s afternoon in.  A G-A-I.  A gay.  Not- not- it’s uh, not gay, it’s just a, it’s a bridal shower for guys.  A guy shower.  An hour long shower with guys.    ",3,14,44
Michael, Yes.  Yes!  Oh!  There-oh! [Clutches chest and falls to the floor],3,14,44
Michael," I can’t believe you’re not going to be there.  It’s going to be good, it’s going to be a great bachelor party man.",3,14,44
Michael," It’s the only time he can do it.  2:30 to 3:15.  It’s going to be great.  We’re going to be doing some darts, we’re going to be grilling up some steaks, got some pie.  Going to be very delicious.",3,14,44
Michael, I can’t get a stripper here.  Sexual Harassment.,3,14,44
Michael," Okay everybody, slight change of plans, we are still going to be having two parties but each is going to get a little extra dose of naught-ay. Uh! [Spanks himself]",3,14,44
Michael, Okay.  Co-ed naked strippers in this office.  For realsies.,3,14,44
Michael, Okay.  We are off.  Ryan and I are going to go get some supplies and I need you to handle hiring the strippers.,3,14,44
Michael," [Pokes Ryan with a sex toy.] Gotcha, oh! [Phone rings.] Yes?",3,14,44
Michael," Hello ladies.  Who here is a history buff?  Who’s a fan of buff naked?  Without further ado, the one, the only, the sexy Mr. Benjamin Franklin.",3,14,44
Michael," He’s in his knickers.  Mr. Franklin, I would say you are probably one of the sexiest presidents ever.",3,14,44
Michael, And when they came over on the Mayflower.  Bow chicka bow.,3,14,44
Michael," Yeah, alright, so I want you to give him your undivided attention and Mr. Franklin, if any of these ladies misbehave I give you permission to spank them.  Especially that one. [Points to Phyllis]  ",3,14,44
Michael, Look at that.  Nothing like grilling in the great outdoors.  ,3,14,44
Michael," Guys, beef!  It’s what’s for dinner!  Who wants some man meat?",3,14,44
Michael," Well then my man meat, he shall have.  There you go.  Deliciousity.",3,14,44
Michael, I call shuffle.  Here we go.  [Spreads cards out all over the table],3,14,44
Michael," Ah, gentlemen, the entertainment is here.  Everybody I’d like to introduce you to Elizabeth.",3,14,44
Michael," Okay.  Alright, I’ll do it.  Yeah.  Lets do it.  Lets do this thing.  Yeah.  What do I?",3,14,44
Michael, Not bad! Not bad!  You smell nice.  Like Tide.,3,14,44
Michael, You smell like Tide detergent.  Do you use Tide detergent?  Ha ha ha!  I have a girlfriend so…,3,14,44
Michael," Yeah she probably, yeah she would be.  You know what, okay, excuse me.  Please stop it, stop it. Turn off the music.  This is wrong, this is wrong!  This is wrong!  I have a girlfriend.  And you are engaged and I’m sure you have a boyfriend in prison or something so lets just clear out okay.  Shame on you.  Go back to work!  ",3,14,44
Michael, On one hand I want to be honest with Jan and tell her the truth but on the other hand I’m afraid she’s going to dump me.,3,14,44
Michael," Well, Ben Franklin, you’re really kind of a sleezebag.  ",3,14,44
Michael," Stripper? Could I ask you a question about women?  Um, should I tell my girlfriend that you danced up on me?",3,14,44
Michael," Not really, look I don’t know how to say this so I just will.",3,14,44
Michael, I went to a bachelor party and things got a little out of hand.,3,14,44
Michael, So you don’t want to end our relationship?,3,14,44
Michael, That is so sweet.  You are the best GD girlfriend in the world.  Do you know that?,3,14,44
Michael," So you know who turned out to be kind of a creep?  Ben Franklin.  And Elizabeth the stripper gave me great advice.  Which rhymed.  Really makes you wonder how Ben Franklin can become president, but someone like Elizabeth can’t.  ",3,14,44
Michael," Phyllis is getting married. And I am in the wedding party. She has asked me to push her father’s wheelchair down the aisle. So, basically, I am co-giving away the bride. Since I pay her salary it is like I’m paying for the wedding. Which I’m happy to do. It’s a big day for Phyllis. But it’s an even bigger day for me. Employer of the bride.  					",3,15,45
Michael, There she is. I swear Phyllis you are as beautiful as the first day you started work at Dunder Mifflin.,3,15,45
Michael," Me, too. If you need to vomit, that is ok. I did. Do you want to talk about tonight?",3,15,45
Michael," You’re probably worried about pleasing Bob. A lot of pressure. Phyllis, did you break wind? It’s okay, if you did. It’s a very natural reaction. It’s your wedding. And you’re nervous… ",3,15,45
Michael, Okay… umm… I’m sure that Bob… Wow. That is… that is pungent. I lost my train of thought. Aaah… Are you set on that hairstyle?,3,15,45
Michael, You might be surprised to learn that I’ve only been to one other wedding. It’s actually a very cute story. My Mom was marrying Jeff. And they asked me to be ring bearer. I was understandably emotional and somehow my pants became wet.,3,15,45
Michael, [in video of Michael as a kid] I hate you!,3,15,45
Michael, Long story short: Jeff’s dog ended up as ring bearer. And the irony is that after the ceremony that dog peed on everything and nobody said ‘boo’.  					,3,15,45
Michael," This strappy young lad sitting here is Phyllis’ father, Albert, and he is quite the ladies’ man, aren’t you Albert, hah? Ah, ringbearer. I could have done better. I will do better. I am going to be better. I can’t believe I’m actually doing this! Ooh! Are you ready for this, Albert? I am. Let’s do it.  					",3,15,45
Michael, [whispers to father] That’s ok. [Albert gets out of his wheelchair and starts walking],3,15,45
Michael, Me walking Phyllis down the aisle was supposed to be the highlight of the wedding. And now… the wedding has no highlight.  					,3,15,45
Michael," I can’t believe I pushed that… that guy’s lazy ass around all day… until he was ready to stand up and steal the show. That’s… well… I got news for you, Albert. If that’s your real name. The show’s not over.  					",3,15,45
Michael," Ladies and Gentlemen, may I present to you for the first time as a couple, Mr. and Mrs. Bob Vance!",3,15,45
Michael," Ladies and Gentleman, for the first time as a couple, Mr. and Mrs. Bob Vance. [generalized clapping and cheering] Yeah! That’s what I’m talking about!  					",3,15,45
Michael," Congratulations, Bob. You’re a good man. But just know… if you ever lay a finger on Phyllis, I will kill you.",3,15,45
Michael," Agreed. No fingers will be laid on Phyllis. [to Albert] Oh, decided to sit down again, huh? Great. Bet you can hear me, too.  					",3,15,45
Michael, Phyllis! Are you happy with everything? What can I do to make it more perfecter?,3,15,45
Michael, I’m already on it. The chicken? Totally undercooked. I sent it back.,3,15,45
Michael, I do. I know a fair amount about fine food… and drink. This is a white.  					,3,15,45
Michael," Thank you, Randy. That was great. Thank you. Thank you very much. Hi, I’m Michael Scott and for the next forty minutes, I’m going to be your tour guide through the lives of Phyllis Lapin and Bob Vance.  One of the great, seemingly impossible, love stories of our time. My name is Michael Scott. Webster’s Dictionary defines “wedding” as the fusing of two metals with a hot torch. Well, you know something. I think you guys are two metals. Gold medals. For those of you who don’t know me, I’m Michael Scott, Phyllis’ boss. To quote from The Princess Bride “Mawige…   					",3,15,45
Michael," The most important part of a speech is the opening line. When time is not a factor, I like to try out three or four different ones.  					",3,15,45
Michael," Phyllis and Bob: their celebrity couple name would be Phlob. You look at her… and she’s kind of matronly today, but back in High School, I swear, her nickname was ‘Easy Rider’. Now as for Bob… Bob Vance… ",3,15,45
Michael," he works… Okay hold, hold on, hold on. Look. Look. I didn’t say anything when Phyllis’ dad upstaged me at the ceremony. And I think you owe me this. Kay.",3,15,45
Michael, Oh. Yeah. You’re out of here! You’re… Yeah. I hate you!  					,3,15,45
Michael," Look, I just wanted to go in and quietly sit and have a piece of cake. I’m not even going to dance one song.",3,15,45
Michael, [sings] ee… I was meant for you… buppity du bom bu.  					,3,15,45
Michael, I just want Phyllis to have a great day.,3,15,45
Michael, We are great together. We are a great team.,3,15,45
Michael, Yes. Yes. They were. Robert Parrish! I should talk to her. I don’t want this to ruin her honeymoon.,3,15,45
Michael," Dude, keep it together. I listened to you for half an hour even though most of that stuff went right over my head.  					",3,15,45
Michael, Phyllis. Phyllis! Wait! Please. I’m sorry. I just… I just wanted to make this a day to remember.,3,15,45
Michael, They say that your wedding day goes by in such a flash that your lucky if you even get a piece of your own cake. I say that’s crazy. I say let them eat cake. Margaret Thatcher said that about marriage. Smart broad.  					,3,15,45
Michael, Be careful. Oh no!! [Phyllis and Bob smear cake on each other’s face] Oh wow! Phyllis! Phyllis! You look like a clown! Here. Get me! Get me! [Michael smears cake on his own face]  					,3,15,45
Michael," Today’s a special day, because I am being honored as a… visiting… professor, special lecturer, emeritus… how did you, how did you…",3,16,46
Michael," In business school, Kevin. Business school. ",3,16,46
Michael," A boss is like a teacher. And I am like the cool teacher. Like Mr. Handell. Mr. Handell would hang out with us, and he would tell us awesome jokes. And he actually hooked up with one of the students. Um… and then like twelve other kids came forward. It was in all the papers. … Really ruined eighth grade for us.  				",3,16,46
Michael, Here we go. College Roadshow. Gotta bring our… A game. What was the most inspiring thing I’ve ever said to you?,3,16,46
Michael," A lot of times, at a… school, or naval academy, after a rousing speech, the crowd would throw its hats high into the air.",3,16,46
Michael," Yeah, I know, I know. I’m just saying if they did throw their hats I’ve got a great line for that: “May your hats fly as high as your dreams.” … That was a pretty good line. ",3,16,46
Michael," I understand! Wow. Relax, spazzy boy. Sometimes you’re such a little spaz! [pokes Ryan] Whoa, hey!",3,16,46
Michael," Campus. Brings back so many memories. … That I would have made. Hey. Frisbee. Check that out. Aww! What do you say we get our Fris on before class? [runs over, throws frisbee] Whoo!",3,16,46
Michael," Okay, this is it. Ryan is doing my intro right now.",3,16,46
Michael," I can’t hear what he’s saying, but he looks like he’s really into it.   				",3,16,46
Michael," Hello everyone, I am Michael Scott. And I would like to start today by inspiring you. May I borrow someone’s textbook, please? Thank you. What have we here? Ooh. Economics. Very, very interesting. [rips pages out of book] You cannot learn from books. Replace these pages with life lessons, and then, you will have… a book… that is worth its weight in gold. [gives book back] I know these are expensive, um, but the lesson is priceless. Good. Alright. I think you’re inspired. Shall we proceed? There are four kinds of business: Tourism. Food service. Railroads, and sales. And hospitals slash manufacturing. And air travel.   				",3,16,46
Michael," So, you wanna start a business. How do you start? What do you need? Well, first of all, you need a building. And secondly, you need supply. You need something to sell. Now this could be anything. It could be… a… thingamajig. Or a… a whosi-whatsi. Or… [pulls out a candy bar] a Whatchamacallit [throws bar]. Now, you need to sell those in order to have a PayDay [takes out a PayDay, throws it]. And, if you sell enough of them, you will make a 100 Grand [throws 100 Grand bar]. [pulls out a Snickers] Satisfied?  				",3,16,46
Michael," Okay, I’m seeing some confused… faces out there. Let me slow down a little bit. Break this down. Okay. The more stickers you sell, the more profit, fancy word for money, you have to buy PlayStations and Beanie Babies. ",3,16,46
Michael," Well… okay, I was just kind of getting it going. Um, alright. Well, okay, we can do questions. Okay. Very good. First hand up.",3,16,46
Michael," We can’t overestimate the value of computers. Yes, they are great for playing games and forwarding funny emails. But real business is done on paper, okay? Write that down. [everyone types on their laptops]   				",3,16,46
Michael," …I say you will miss our service, and I absolutely guarantee you’ll come back.",3,16,46
Michael," …We don’t want them back, ’cause they’re… stupid. ",3,16,46
Michael," Nice try, how’s your Pollack-says-what index? ",3,16,46
Michael," Thanks, Kowalsky. Um, can we get on track here? ",3,16,46
Michael," Yeah sure, you know business, sitting up here in your ivory tower. And your ebony tower. You know what? Tell you one thing, Dunder-Mifflin is here to stay.",3,16,46
Michael," Yeah, yeah. You know what else is facing five Goliaths? America. Al-Qaeda, global warming, sex predators… mercury poisoning. So do we just give up? Is that what we’re learning in business school?",3,16,46
Michael," Dunder-Mifflin is the big picture! Can’t you understand that? No, you can’t. You’re too young. Ryan… has never made a sale. And he started a fire trying to make a cheesy pita. And everybody thinks he’s a tease. Well you know what? He doesn’t know anything, and neither do you. [walks out] SO SUCK ON THAT!  				",3,16,46
Michael," Business is always personal. It’s the most personal thing in the world. When we get back to the office, pack your things.",3,16,46
Michael," Fire you? No, no no. You are moving… to the annex.",3,16,46
Michael," A good manager doesn’t fire people. He hires people and inspires people. … People, Ryan. And people will never go out of business.  				",3,16,46
Michael," Pam-casso! Sorry I’m late, I had to race across town. ",3,16,46
Michael," My God, these could be tracings! Ohh! Look at this one. Wow! You nailed it. [sighs] … How much?",3,16,46
Michael," Well, yeah. Yeah, we have to have it for the office. I mean, there’s my… window, and there’s my car! That your car?",3,16,46
Michael, That is our building… and we sell paper. … I am really proud of you.,3,16,46
Michael," It is… a message. It is an inspiration, it is… a source of beauty. And without paper, it could not have happened. Unless, you had a camera.   				",3,16,46
Michael," A lot of people think that magic camp is just for kids. And that’s why so many other people in my class were kids. Self fulfilling prophecy. It’s um, it’s really for anybody with a dream and a belief in magic and a little extra time after school.   ",3,17,47
Michael," MAGIC MAGIC Magic Magic magic magic… And now, Michael the Magic, will attempt to escape from extreme bondage. [Kevin giggles] Can he do it? I don’t see how he can.",3,17,47
Michael," No. No. Everyone, now count down with me. THREE!",3,17,47
Michael," No. Alright, this is getting hot. So let’s just do this. Ok, ready? Three, two, one, go. [Michael spits out key, Jim covers it with his foot.]",3,17,47
Michael," I cannot tell you how I plan to escape. Other than by using magic. That is the magician’s code. Separately, on an unrelated note, if you happen to find a small brass key…  ",3,17,47
Michael, Ready? Come on guys. Early worm gets the worm. ,3,17,47
Michael," “Michael, you go to parties all the time, why is tonight so special?” Well, tonight is so special because my boss’s boss’s boss, the CFO, not his initials, common mistake, is having a little shindig for all the managers in the company. And Jan and I are going as a couple. For the first time. So it’s kind of our coming out party. Really. And that is why tonight is so special.   ",3,17,47
Michael," Go in together, could save some gas, have some fun, long trip.",3,17,47
Michael," Oh, sure. Really didn’t give it any thought. Wait, should you be going? [phone rings] Heh-woh you. ",3,17,47
Michael, I am on my way. I should be there in about 15…,3,17,47
Michael, No problem. [doesn’t turn off speakerphone],3,17,47
Michael," Ok. Jan. Jan? This party is actually a really big step for us. So, I…",3,17,47
Michael," I don’t care. Oh, wow. Here. Don’t put my jacket. Don’t give me that.",3,17,47
Michael," Actually, it’s polite to arrive early. And smart. Only really good friends show up early. Ergo de facto. Go to a party really early. Become a really good friend.   ",3,17,47
Michael," Oh, you probably want to leave the cover on until the guests get here.   ",3,17,47
Michael," It’s been sitting in my car all day. Sun beating down on the mayonnaise. Just, you never know.  ",3,17,47
Michael, What are you looking for? You bring dip?,3,17,47
Michael, Awesome. I’m going to frame mine. I could frame yours too.,3,17,47
Michael," You don’t have to, Jan. This contract says it all.   ",3,17,47
Michael," Rachel. Boy, you clean up good. Place looks great with all the lights on. And everything.  Actually looks bigger with people in it. It’s weird. So…",3,17,47
Michael, Jan and I are lovers. It feels so good to finally say that out loud.,3,17,47
Michael," It did. Like butter. Mike Myers, SNL. You should ask Karen, she was one of them. ",3,17,47
Michael," Yeah, but you’re great now, right? We’re all great. Aren’t we great?",3,17,47
Michael," Here is to Mr. Iacocca and his failed experiment, the De Lorean. [takes sip, coughs violently]",3,17,47
Michael, This one really smells like vanilla. Check that out.,3,17,47
Michael, You and the misses should join us at Sandals Jamaica next Christmas. ,3,17,47
Michael," Oh yeah, they don’t allow kids at Sandals. They are persona non gratis… there. But it’s fun. It’s an awesome place. You would not believe how low this girl can limbo. ",3,17,47
Michael, Ok. Excuse me. What’s going on? What is it?,3,17,47
Michael," Yes, but you could tell me. What… What is that? Why are you? Why are we going in the bathroom? I thought this is where you liked your privacy. ",3,17,47
Michael," No, no, no, means please don’t. Please.",3,17,47
Michael, I’m not going to slam you up against the wall. ,3,17,47
Michael, Rachel thinks that I brought homemade potato salad and I just picked it up at the supermarket. It’s funny. I wish I could make potato salad that good. It’s just potatoes and mayonnaise. There is something wrong with Jan.  ,3,17,47
Michael," Our first fight. If this is about what happened in the bathroom, there was no place to cuddle…",3,17,47
Michael, You didn’t have any of the potato salad did you?,3,17,47
Michael," Well, if that’s the way you feel, my lady, then you have hurt me greatly. ",3,17,47
Michael, I’m not going to cry. I feel like it but I am not going to. Why don’t you just take your stupid love contract and tear it up into a million little pieces. ,3,17,47
Michael," I want the house, Jan. I want the picket fence. I want the ketchup fights and the tickling, and the giggling.",3,17,47
Michael," No need for consternation, everything is under control.",3,18,48
Michael," It was a crime of passion, Jan, not a disgruntled employee. Everyone here is extremely gruntled.  ",3,18,48
Michael," No, he has been wanting a raise for a couple of months and he’s just using this Roy thing as leverage.  ",3,18,48
Michael," Ok I want you to be Darryl and ask me for a raise, because I want to try out some of these negotiation tactics on you.",3,18,48
Michael," Wikipedia… is the best thing ever.  Anyone in the world can write anything they want about any subject, so you know you are getting the best possible information.  				",3,18,48
Michael," Hmm, well that’s interesting Darryl.  I think… [mumbling softly] that maybe you should… [mumbling jibberish]",3,18,48
Michael," What I’m saying is that, [continues to mumble jibberish]",3,18,48
Michael," By leaning back, and by whispering, I established a dominant physical position.  ",3,18,48
Michael, [gets up and begins to walk out of the room],3,18,48
Michael, Oh it… sounded interesting… what you were gonna…  				,3,18,48
Michael," You know what?  Actually, let’s go into the conference room.",3,18,48
Michael," No, you know what?  Let’s stay here.  No let’s go… Yeah let’s go to the conference room.  				",3,18,48
Michael, Tactic number six.  Change the location of the meeting at the last second.  Totally throws ’em off.  				,3,18,48
Michael," Number 14, declining to speak first.  Makes them feel uncomfortable, puts you in control.    				",3,18,48
Michael, [long pause] I am declining to speak first.,3,18,48
Michael," Hmm.  Ohh, Darryl.  You are a good worker, and a good man.  I just, you know, times are tight.  And I just don’t think corporate is going to go for this right now.  ",3,18,48
Michael, [Darryl laughs] I do not buy woman’s clothes.  I would not make that mistake again.  ,3,18,48
Michael," Alright, you know what?  Pam, could you please tell Darryl that this is not a woman’s suit?  ",3,18,48
Michael," No, I do, I, I wear men’s suits, OK?  I got this out of a bin.  				",3,18,48
Michael," There were these huge bins of clothes, and everybody was rifling through them like crazy, and I grabbed one.  And it fit!  So I don’t think that this is totally just a woman’s suit.  At the very least it’s bisexual.  				",3,18,48
Michael," Uh, [reading the inside of his jacket] MISSterious.  And it is mysterious because the buttons are on the wrong side… that’s the mystery.",3,18,48
Michael," It’s European, OK?  It’s a European cut.",3,18,48
Michael," No, they don’t.  See?  [Michael lifts his jacket tail, sticks out his back side and shows Pam]",3,18,48
Michael," No, I don’t want to do that because I’m twice your size anyway.",3,18,48
Michael," Negotiations are all about controlling things.  About being in the driver’s seat.  And make one tiny mistake, you’re dead.  I made one tiny mistake.  I wore woman’s clothes.  				",3,18,48
Michael, Let’s get down to business.  Why don’t you tell me why you think you deserve a raise.  ,3,18,48
Michael, [mumbling softly] That was a very good point.,3,18,48
Michael, [mumbling softly] You make a very compelling argument.  				,3,18,48
Michael," I am going to give you a piece of paper.  I want you to write down how much you want, and I want you to slide it back across the desk to me.",3,18,48
Michael," Because, that is the way these things are done.  In… films. [Darryl writes the amount and starts to hand the paper to Michael] No, slide— slide it, yes.",3,18,48
Michael," I… I can’t give you that, I— I don’t make this much.",3,18,48
Michael, I don’t.  Want me to prove it to you?  There is… a pay stub.,3,18,48
Michael," A boss’s salary isn’t just about money, it is about perks.  It… for example, every year I get a $100 gas card… Can’t put a price tag on that.  				",3,18,48
Michael," Okay.  Okay, here’s the straight… dope.  No tricks.  No Wikipedia.",3,18,48
Michael," I talked to corporate, and they told me that I can only give you a 5% raise.",3,18,48
Michael, I’m not gonna go out and ask for a raise right now.  That is ridiculous. ,3,18,48
Michael, I have been a loyal employee for a long time.  ,3,18,48
Michael," No, Jan.  I’ve never asked for a raise in 14 years.  This is long overdue.  I wanna do it today.  ",3,18,48
Michael," Yshhyah.  Um, yeah.  I’ll leave right away.",3,18,48
Michael," [talking over Jan] No, Toby is terrible.  Toby is the worst human being I’ve ever known. ",3,18,48
Michael," Where?  I’m gonna smack you in the head with a hammer.  Come on, let’s go.",3,18,48
Michael, [imitating Chris Tucker] Don’t ever touch a black man’s radio!  …Chris Tucker.  ,3,18,48
Michael," Pippity poppity, give me the zoppity.  ",3,18,48
Michael, Were you going to tell me that you hired James Van Der Beek?,3,18,48
Michael, Six percent?  After all we’ve been through?,3,18,48
Michael," No.  You gonna play it like this?  You give me a good raise, or no more sex. [Toby begins to write] [to Toby] What are you writing, perv-ball? ",3,18,48
Michael," Why don’t you just take that pen and stab me in the heart.  This is me, Jan.  This is me!  ",3,18,48
Michael," Okay, no, no, no, no.  You do not try tactic number eight on me.  I invented tactic number eight.  I’m not going anywhere.",3,18,48
Michael," Ohh.  It was a weird day.  I accidentally cross-dressed.  And then Darryl made me feel bad for not making any money.  And then I had to ride up here with stupid Toby.  And then, your assistant, is all young and hot.  And I—",3,18,48
Michael, Well that’s ridiculous I’m not gonna make—,3,18,48
Michael," Ah, so…  All right, Levinson.  Here’s the rub.  I would like a 15% raise.",3,18,48
Michael," Negotiation is an art.  Back and forth.  Give and take.  And today, both Darryl and I took something.  Higher salaries.  Win win win.  But you know, life is about more… than just salaries.  It’s about perks.  Like having sex with Jan–",3,18,48
Michael," Look, I am not a gazillionaire.  I can’t… I can’t dress like Donald Trump dresses.  I have to stay within the parameters of my budget.  I can’t shop at a fancy Norwegian boutique.  I buy my suits the old fashioned way.  I buy them from discount stores… or on eBay.  And when I found out that Ross was having a midnight madness sale, I ran, not walked, as per the instructions on the flier.  And I got there, and when the doors opened, all of these women ran to this one bin.  And I did too.  And I grabbed this suit.  And a woman, sort of a, I don’t know, Missy Elliot type, grabbed the jacket.  And, uh, we had kind of a heated tug of war.  And I could tell by the way she was screaming that this must be a get.  And I figured she was just buying it for her husband, to answer your question from before.  Um, anyway, she s… socked me, in the eye.  And she got it, she got the suit.  But, I went to the Ross, in Trenton New Jersey, and I found the exact same suit.  And I didn’t have to deal with Missy Elliot.  					",3,18,48
Michael," Today is Safety Training Day.  Toby is leading ours upstairs.  Yeauck.  But, I am giving everyone a little bit of a treat.  We are going to listen in on Darryl’s presentation to the warehouse.  And if I know Darryl, it gonna be zoppity.  					",3,19,49
Michael," Guys, I’m not the only one who’s driven the forklift.  [points] Pudge has driven the forklift.",3,19,49
Michael," [barely keeping his composure] “Hey Darryl, how’s it hangin’?!” [laughs]  					",3,19,49
Michael," Yes, yes.  But it wouldn’t be the worst thing in the world… if somebody…",3,19,49
Michael," Okay, okay!  I got it.  I got it.  …  Only on the rarest of occasions…",3,19,49
Michael," Toby now has the floor…  and he is going to try not to screw this up, like everything else in his life.  Let me rephrase that.  I believe that you can do safety training and make it sound just as good as Darryl.  Here we go!",3,19,49
Michael," Yes, good.  Fine.  Like stretching and…",3,19,49
Michael," Wow, that is… that time really adds up.  That’s like… a half an hour, every hour?",3,19,49
Michael," Ok, you know what?  You’re making it sound kind of lame. So, skip ahead to the really dangerous stuff.  Like sometimes computers can explode, can they not?",3,19,49
Michael," Ok, you know what?  I think that everybody is going to vomit due to boredom.  [to warehouse guys]  Sorry, he is very lame.  [takes book from Toby] Um, let’s see.  “Seasonal affective disorder!  A depression that includes weight gain, fatigue, irritability, brought on by the low light of winter.”",3,19,49
Michael," Ok guys, you know what?  I didn’t— I didn’t interrupt when you were having your presentation.",3,19,49
Michael," Yes.  Okay, let’s do another one.  This is a good one.  “A particular concern for office workers is a sedimentary life style, which can contribute—“",3,19,49
Michael, Yes.  “Which can contribute to heart disease.”  Heart disease kills more people that balers.,3,19,49
Michael," Darryl, I did not walk out in the middle of yours.  So, I—",3,19,49
Michael," Okay.  … What, Nerf isn’t cool anymore?  					",3,19,49
Michael," Darryl thinks he is such a man because he works in a warehouse.  I worked in a warehouse.  Men’s Warehouse.  I was a greeter.  I’d like to see Darryl greet people.  Probably make ’em feel like wimps.  Not me, I…  “Hello, I’m Michael.  Welcome to Men’s Warehouse.  We have a special on khaki pants today.” … This is one example.  					",3,19,49
Michael," Pam, depression is as scary as a baler, right?",3,19,49
Michael, Working in an office can lead to depression.  Which can lead to suicide.  I mean this is really serious stuff.,3,19,49
Michael," I— I—  Nobody commits suicide because they work with a baler, and yet those guys are makin’ fun of me, calling me a Nerf, that…",3,19,49
Michael," Yeah… you are… ah, so right.  They had visual aids.  And all we had were the facts.  You don’t go to the science museum and get handed a pamphlet on electricity.  You go to the science museum and you put your hand on a metal ball, your hair sticks up straight… and you know science.",3,19,49
Michael," They use props.  They use visual aids, and they just made us look like dopes.",3,19,49
Michael," I don’t know, I don’t know.  Because you know what our killer is?  Depression—",3,19,49
Michael," You may be asking yourself, “What am I doing on a trampoline?”  Well, I thought I’d bounce here for a while, relieve some stress, and then move on with my day.  Not!  Here’s the plan.  Dwight, is going to gather all of the office workers and all of the warehouse guys, we’re going to have another safety seminar.  Only this time, where’s Michael?  Oh my God!  He is on the roof!  Now I have got their attention.  I… tell them, about the cold hard facts of depression.  And then I say, “Hey!  You ever seen a suicide?”  And I jump.  And they freak out.  And they get to see… the dangers of depression with their own eyes.  Nice side note:",3,19,49
Michael," Maybe we should test it first.  Letterman-style.  Throw a TV over, or…",3,19,49
Michael, BINGO!  WHOA WHOA WHOA!  Oh… crap.  Deactivate the car alarm.  Clean up the mess.,3,19,49
Michael," Find out whose car that is.  If it’s Stanley’s, call the offices of James P. Albini, see if he handles hate crimes.",3,19,49
Michael," Also, take apart the trampoline, stick it in the baler.",3,19,49
Michael," Have Pa–adge do it, or… the sea monster.",3,19,49
Michael," No.  No more.  The tests are going terrible.  If we keep doing it, we’re not gonna want to jump.  This is about doing, not thinking.",3,19,49
Michael, I am ready to do this!  I am ready to make a point! [Dwight continues air guitar]  					,3,19,49
Michael," Everything’s wrong.  The stress of my modern office, has caused me to go into a depression.",3,19,49
Michael," Dwight, you ignorant slut.  Depression is a very serious illness.  Over 32 thousand people commit suicide every year!  According to a 2004 study!",3,19,49
Michael, Yes!  My head is in such pain!  And turmoil!,3,19,49
Michael," Everything is wrong, Dwight.  The stress of my modern office, has made me depressed.",3,19,49
Michael," And that is why, I am going to jump off this roof!",3,19,49
Michael," Dwight, you are such a liar.  Pam, really, what is it?",3,19,49
Michael," You told me, that I lead a… cushy, wimpy, Nerf life.",3,19,49
Michael," It’s complicated with Jan.  And I don’t know where I stand, or what I want.  The sex isn’t nearly as good as it used to be.",3,19,49
Michael," Okay.  Pam, I’m coming down to get my present.  					",3,19,49
Michael," An office… is as safe as the people in it.  And sometimes those people can drive you to do crazy things to show the dangers of the office.  That’s the danger I found myself in today.  I saved a life.  My own.  Am I a hero?  I really can’t say.  But, yes.  					",3,19,49
Michael," [on phone] It is disgusting.  I totally agree.  Well, we’re going to recalling all of that paper.  				",3,20,50
Michael," We have a crisis.  Apparently, a disgruntled employee at the paper mill decided that it would be funny to put an obscene watermark on our 24 pound cream butter stock.  Five hundred boxes has gone out, with the image of a beloved cartoon duck, performing…  unspeakable acts upon a certain cartoon mouse that a lot of people like.  I’ve never been a fan.  				",3,20,50
Michael," Everybody in here.  STAT.  No time to lose.  Cri-Man-Squa.  F and C, doubletime.",3,20,50
Michael, Front and Center. Twice as fast as you would normally go.  Any other questions?,3,20,50
Michael, You know what? Bluh bluh bluh bluh bluh!  Forget it.  Where is Creed?,3,20,50
Michael," Creed.  Quality assurance.  Your job.  I really think you screwed the pooch on one, Creed.  Because of you, the entire company is in jeopardy.  				",3,20,50
Michael," We have a lot of angry customers out there.  This puts us at threat level midnight.  Accounting, you are on customer service duty today.",3,20,50
Michael," Jim, big fire in your house.  Your client, Dunmore High-school, sent out their prom invitations on this paper.  Went home to all the kids.",3,20,50
Michael," No, no, no, no.  Not good enough.  This is a keystone account.  I want you in the school.  In person.",3,20,50
Michael," No, sweet cheeks.  We need someone who’s actually made a sale.  Andy, you go.",3,20,50
Michael," No, no.  I need two men on this.  That’s what she said.  No time!  But she did.  NO TIME!  Guys, get on this.  Dwight, I want you to be in charge of the press conference.",3,20,50
Michael," No, Pam.  The press is just gonna find out by themselves.",3,20,50
Michael," Here’s the thing.  When a company screws up, best thing to do is call a press conference.  Alert the media, and then you control the story.  Wait for them to find out, and the story controls you.  That’s what happened to O.J.  				",3,20,50
Michael," I have invited Barbara Allen, one of our oldest clients, to come in here, and meet with me, for a personal apology.  The press wants a story, I will give them a story.",3,20,50
Michael," OK, press conference in 45.  Dwight, make sure this place looks nice.",3,20,50
Michael," Mrs. Allen is our most important client… because every client is our most important client.  Even though she’s a pretty unimportant client, really.  				",3,20,50
Michael," And so, with the eyes of the nation upon us, I would like to say that Dunder Mifflin truly regrets this unfortunate incident.  And, as a gesture of gratitude, for your continued loyalty, Mrs. Allen, I would like to present you with this novelty check, for six months of free paper or 25 reams, whichever comes first.  ",3,20,50
Michael," I know, I know you’re angry.  And we are truly, truly sorry.",3,20,50
Michael," We… are going to do everything humanly possible, to ensure that this never happens again.",3,20,50
Michael," Well… [exhales] OK, well…  Um, wasn’t really my fault.  The guys at the papermill—",3,20,50
Michael," No— my— OK, this is insane.  You can get out of here.  Get out!",3,20,50
Michael, That’s insane.  We’ll give this to somebody who will appreciate it.,3,20,50
Michael," Yeah, well I’m calling the Ungrateful Bi-atch Hotline! [to Chad Lite] Did you get all that?",3,20,50
Michael," We gotta do something. [exhales] This is spinning out of control, Pam.  This is just, not…",3,20,50
Michael," No, then Newsweek picks it up.  And then CNN does a story about it.  Then… YouTube gets a hold of it…",3,20,50
Michael, You’re right.  It will blow over.  But it’s not… going to take… a week or two.  [pulls out a video camcorder from his desk] Do you know what this is for?,3,20,50
Michael," [Dwight is spraying far too much hairspray into Michael’s hair] OK, I think that’s good.  				",3,20,50
Michael," “Hello.  I am Michael Scott, Regional Manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton.  By now you are probably sick of hearing about Dunder Mifflin and our embarrassing watermark boner.  Let me tell you something.  Something from the heart.  I am not leaving this office.  It will take a SWAT team, to remove me from this office, and maybe not even that.”",3,20,50
Michael," Do you think you’re taking it a little… literally, Dwight?  And now we’re wasting tape.  I’m gonna have to cut this all out.  Can you say cut?",3,20,50
Michael," Five, four, three.  “There is no way, I will resign.  It wouldn’t be fair.  Not to the good workers I work with, not to my clients, and especially not to me.  Let’s not forget who this whole resigning business is about, anyway.  If I could leave you with one thought, remember… it wasn’t me.  They’re trying to make me an escape goat.  If I am fired, I swear to God, that every single piece of copier paper in this town is going to have the F-word on it.  The F-word.  You have one day.”",3,20,50
Michael," OK. [deep breath] Phyllis, you say? [snorts] Hmm. [suppressed laugher]",3,21,51
Michael," Um… I mean did he even see Pam? Or, uh… Karen from behind?  ",3,21,51
Michael, [laughing softly] I’m sorry. It’s pretty funny when you think about it.,3,21,51
Michael," Oh, OK. Masters of comedy. A guy dropped his pants. Have you ever been to the circus? [everyone glares] OK. [Michael puts his finger through his pant’s zipper] He’s back! [laughs] OK. Hmm. [babbling with his coat pulled closed] Waagh! [flashes everyone]",3,21,51
Michael, What? Oh. [makes descending scale noise as his finger goes down],3,21,51
Michael," Oh, Phyllis got flashed. It’s, uh… [laughs]",3,21,51
Michael," Oh, come on.  We are laughing at Phyllis, but she’s not even here, so no harm, no foul.",3,21,51
Michael," Incidentally, where were you during all of this? Maybe you’re the flasher.",3,21,51
Michael," Uh-huh. Prove it. Let’s see your penis. [everyone is shocked] [exhales]I… you know, as that was coming out of my mouth, I knew that it was wrong.  				",3,21,51
Michael," In all the excitement, I forgot that my primary goal is to keep people safe. Women can’t have fun if they don’t feel safe. For example, Jan and I have a safe word in case things go too far. Foliage. And if one of us says that word, the other one has to stop. Although last time… she pretended she didn’t hear me.  				",3,21,51
Michael, I don’t know. I feel… I drive a lot. I’m spending a fortune on gas and tolls –,3,21,51
Michael," Um, that… I don’t know. That makes me kind of uncomfortable.",3,21,51
Michael, [exhales] I am sick over this thing. Those people out there are clearly afraid. And that can’t happen. Not in my house.,3,21,51
Michael," Dwight, are those your pants? That’s a Polaroid. [Dwight takes the Polaroid and crumples it in his hand]  				",3,21,51
Michael," Attention, everybody. Dwight has something he would like to say.",3,21,51
Michael," OK, you know something, Dwight? We are not the terrorists. Why don’t you just take these women, put ’em in a burlap sack, and hit ’em with a stick? Because that’s what you’re doing. I celebrate these women. They deserve the right to dress as they please. If Pam wants to show more cleavage, she should be able to. I encourage that.",3,21,51
Michael," See? That’s what we’re talking about. Did you hear that, Dwight?",3,21,51
Michael," No, Dwight. Respect. R-E-S-P-svee-T. Find out what it means to me. All right, you know what? That’s it. Conference room, five minutes. Women’s appreciation.",3,21,51
Michael," Oh, I don’t know, James. Did I come from a woman? Have I slept with a woman? More than one?",3,21,51
Michael, You know what? I am the expert. I will conduct it. I know the crap out of women.  				,3,21,51
Michael," I, um… would like to apologize for all of the men who thought this was a laughing matter.     ",3,21,51
Michael," Nobody likes to be flashed. When Meredith flashed me at that Christmas party, I nearly vomited.",3,21,51
Michael," OK, no catfights. Please. Let’s – my point is… my point is… a penis, when seen in the right context, is the most wonderful sight for a woman. But in the wrong context, it is like a monster movie.",3,21,51
Michael," What are…? Shut it. Shut. Up. OK, so what I want to engage us in today is a hardcore discussion about women’s problems and issues and situations. Magazines and TV shows and movies portray women as skinny, tall goddesses. Well, look around. Are women like that? No. No, they are not. [points to Pam] Even the hot ones aren’t really that skinny. So what does that say? That says that you women are up against it. And it is criminal. Society doesn’t care. Society sucks. I don’t even consider myself a part of society. FYI. Because I am so angry over all of this.",3,21,51
Michael," Yes. Thank you. That was not necessary, but I appreciated it. And I proves my point. Women can do anything.",3,21,51
Michael, No. I’m being misogynistic. That is insane. I am not being sexist.,3,21,51
Michael, Because wha… that was one possible explanation as to why you got that haircut.,3,21,51
Michael, I have to know whether you’re serious or not.,3,21,51
Michael," You’re right. You’re right, you’re right. And you know why? It’s because of where we are. This is a masculine environment. We need to find a place where you feel comfortable. You know where we’re gonna go? The Steamtown Mall. [Kelly gasps]  				",3,21,51
Michael," OK, let’s go, ladies of Dunder-Mifflin. Hey, we should have a calendar printed up. Pam, put that in my good idea folder. [Pam nods] Let’s go!",3,21,51
Michael, [Meredith parking the car] I don’t think she’s gonna make it. Don’t think she’s gonna make it – [metal scraping],3,21,51
Michael," You’re welcome. You’re welcome, you’re welcome. OK. So, let’s dish.",3,21,51
Michael," Anything you guys want. This is your time. [everyone is silent or continues to eat, Michael exhales] Mm. What is a Pap smear? Or is it “shmear?” Like the cream cheese.",3,21,51
Michael," What, um… what do you think of role-play?",3,21,51
Michael," Yeah? Well, Jan has this schoolgirl fantasy.",3,21,51
Michael, I just… I feel uncomfortable wearing the dress.,3,21,51
Michael, Jan says anything that doesn’t scare us is not worth doing. I don’t know. Maybe we’re different people. I like cuddling and spooning and she likes videotaping us during sex.,3,21,51
Michael, [groans] And then watching it back right afterward to improve my form.,3,21,51
Michael," No, it’s not that bad. The worst part is that she shows it to her therapist and they discuss it.",3,21,51
Michael," No, she’s… she’s fooling around. It’s a woman thing.",3,21,51
Michael," No… No, it’s all right. I’m OK. I’m OK. [sniffing] You guys… what are we gonna do about Jan? [sighs]  				",3,21,51
Michael," OK. Jan is smart. Uh, successful. Good clothes. Hot. Perfect skin. Nice butt.",3,21,51
Michael, She’s totally flat. Shrunken chesticles.,3,21,51
Michael, I’m happy sometimes. Um… when we scrapbook or right towards the end of having sex.,3,21,51
Michael, That sounds good too. I don’t know who’s right. I just don’t – I don’t know. I don’t know.,3,21,51
Michael, I wanna break up with Jan. Wow. I wanna break up with Jan.,3,21,51
Michael," Wow, I cannot believe this yogurt has no calories.",3,21,51
Michael," Oh, hey, guys. I want to do something nice for you, because you did something so nice for me earlier. I want you to go in there. I want you to buy one item on me as a thank-you. [Kelly sprints inside Victoria’s Secret] Come on. Get in here.  				",3,21,51
Michael," Let’s face it, most guys are from the Dark Ages. They’re caveman. And they like a woman to be showing her cleavage and to be wearing 8-inch heels, and to be wearing, um, see-through underpants. But… for me, a woman looks best when she is just absolutely naked.  				",3,21,51
Michael," Mm. You don’t want anything? My treat. Some panties or… pick a thong or… G-string. T-back. Get a nice bra. Padded bra. See-through, push-up, lace? Thigh-high? Bustier? Any – it just – you know what, I would love to buy you a fresh set of underwear.",3,21,51
Michael," Oh. Oh, no. [inhales sharply]  It’s Jan. What do I do?",3,21,51
Michael," Uh, yeah. Yep. Um… Could somebody grab me the lever, and I will…",3,21,51
Michael," Yeah, get your hazards on for safety. Let’s see. [takes off his coat and tosses it aside] There we go! [Pam brings over the jack and lug wrench] Good. Yes, we have the… all right. [tries the use the jack to loosen the lug nuts]",3,21,51
Michael, Do you have a… a crescent? A crescent Allan?,3,21,51
Michael, Uh… you know what? I’m going to… you take care of that. I’m gonna do traffic… detail.  				,3,21,51
Michael," You know what? I need my girls with me. Pam, Karen, even Phyllis. Come on. Let’s do this. Let’s do it. [sighs]",3,21,51
Michael, I love you guys.  Now I’m getting her voicemail.,3,21,51
Michael," [leaving a message] Hey, Jan. It’s me, Michael. I’m just calling to say that I think we need a little break, permanently. And, uh, I know everybody says this, but I-I wanna remain friends. Or at least business associates who get along. Oh, just so you know, it’s not me, it’s you. [Jan walks in] OK, buddy. Somebody just walked in. I have to go. Um, so I’ll talk to you later.",3,21,51
Michael," Maybe some Italian. [voice on phone] “… to remain friends. Or at least business associates -” [Jan takes the phone away from her ear] Chinese? [voice on phone] “who get along. Oh, just so you know, it’s not me, it’s you. OK, buddy.”",3,21,51
Michael," [sighs] Any man who says he totally understands women is a fool. Because they are un-understandable. There’s a wishing fountain at the mall. And I threw a coin in for every woman in the world and made a wish. I wished for Jan to get over me. I wished for Phyllis, a plasma TV. I wished for Pam to gain courage. I wished for Angela, a heart, and for Kelly, a brain. “Michael, how can you appreciate women so much but also dump one of them?” You mean, how can I be so illogical and flighty and unpredictable and emotional? Well, maybe I learned something from women after all.  				",3,21,51
Michael, Just… all over. I don’t want to do anything… I’m dying…,3,22,52
Michael, Right there. [Michael points to computer screen.],3,22,52
Michael," OK, everybody out. Out. Out. Out. OK.  				",3,22,52
Michael," To what do I owe this great honor, David Wallace?",3,22,52
Michael, And Gromit. [David sighs] Jan? Is Jan there?,3,22,52
Michael," Oh, you sigh like Jan. I broke Jan’s heart, David, and it was awful. It was… It was never my intention to ruin a life. But you know what? Sometimes…",3,22,52
Michael, Wow. I wish I had prepared something to say.,3,22,52
Michael," OK, everybody have their towels and swim suits? We have about an hour and half.  I suggest that you all go potty now and then we will be congregating on the partay bus.    				",3,22,52
Michael," Oscar, you brought your Speedo, I assume?",3,22,52
Michael," Well, you can’t swim in leather pants. [laughs] I’m just yankin’ your chain.  Not literally.  				",3,22,52
Michael," Oh, you know what? Uh, you’re not going. ",3,22,52
Michael," Yeah, I know. I’m sorry, Toby. We… um… Somebody has to stay here.   				",3,22,52
Michael, I want today to be a beautiful memory… that the staff and I share after I have passed on to New York. And if Toby is a part of it… then it’ll suck.  				,3,22,52
Michael," Hey Pam, I have a very important job for you",3,22,52
Michael," We are. We are. But, I would like you to take notes. And I want you to find out about people’s character. Not their hotness, per se, but their humor, and their charisma, and the indefinable quality that makes you all glad to follow me.   				",3,22,52
Michael, What happens to a company if somebody takes their boss away? I will answer your question with a question. It’s like what happens to a chicken when you take its head away. It dies. Unless you find a new head. I need to see which one of these people have the skills to be a chicken head.   				,3,22,52
Michael," I want you to write down everything that people are doing all day. And then type it up, in a way that is helpful. Alright?  				",3,22,52
Michael," Everybody, may I have you attention please? Today, we are not just spending a day at the beach.",3,22,52
Michael," If you don’t like it, Stanley, you can go to the back of the bus.",3,22,52
Michael," Or the front of the bus. Or drive the bus.  Just, we are all participating in mandatory fun activities.  Funtivities!  And there is a special secret prize for the winner!",3,22,52
Michael," Okay, you know what? Your enthusiasm’s turning people off.",3,22,52
Michael," Well, [whispering] Hey Pam, did you get that down? ",3,22,52
Michael, Like everything I said and everything they did and… Just don’t…,3,22,52
Michael, Well write it down before you forget it. That’s… You’ve just been drawing pictures. [sighs] Rrrr. I can’t stay mad at you.   				,3,22,52
Michael, Here we are ladies and gentlemen. Everybody ready? Last one down is a rotten egg. [Gets off bus] Watch out for snakes!  				,3,22,52
Michael," Alright, find a cozy spot. Everybody settle in. [everybody sits down on beach] OK, everybody up! Circle ’round. [motions for circle to form] Let us play some games. We are situated on the northeast corner of scenic Lake Scranton. America’s eighth largest indigenous body of water. It is here that a group of Americans will undergo the ultimate challenge. One day, 14 strangers who work together, but only one survivor.",3,22,52
Michael," Just words. Inspiring words. [under breath] Not a contender. [out loud] For the competitions, you will be divided into four tribes. Each tribe will have a leader that I will pick randomly off the top of my head without thinking. Jim, Dwight, Andy and Stanley.",3,22,52
Michael, Choose your tribes. Except for Pam. Not Pam.  				,3,22,52
Michael," Jim Halpert. Pros: smart, cool, good-looking. Remind you of anybody you know? Cons: not a hard worker. I can spend all day on a project, and he will finish the same project in a half an hour. So that should tell you something.  				",3,22,52
Michael," Dwight is an obvious candidate for my job. He has the best sales record in the office. He loves the work. He is, however, an idiot.  				",3,22,52
Michael, We are going to choose team names. Dwight?,3,22,52
Michael," Hey, hey, hey. Ok, Ok… Stanley, your team name?",3,22,52
Michael, Then I will name your team the Red team. ,3,22,52
Michael, I am also considering Stanley because of all the good that black people have done. For America.   				,3,22,52
Michael," Very good. Pam, please take a note that Andy is patriotic.  				",3,22,52
Michael, Andy Bernard. Pros: He’s classy. He gets me. He went to Cornell. I trust him. Cons: I don’t really trust him.   				,3,22,52
Michael, It is time for the great spoon and egg race. This one is with a little twist. ,3,22,52
Michael," Shh… The person carrying the egg will be blindfolded. Please put on your blindfolds. That person carrying the egg will go down, circle a torch, come back, deposit their egg in the pail. First team back is the winner. Alright. Ready? Set. Go! [contestants start walking]",3,22,52
Michael, [off screen] Pam…you’re missing things. [shakes off hand and starts writing in notebook]  				,3,22,52
Michael," Okay Pam, I have another little project for you.",3,22,52
Michael," Smart as a whip! Yes! [holds up hot dog packages] These are pre-cooked, so it’s not absolutely necessary, but I would appreciate it if you could heat up 800 hot dogs for a little contest I’m going to be having. I would greatly appreciate it.",3,22,52
Michael, A good manager has got to be hungry. Hungry for success.  				,3,22,52
Michael," OK, who’s hungry [Kevin starts to put hot dog in mouth] No, no, no. Do not touch the food. Please. Not yet. That is our next event. A hot dog eating contest. [sighs at the table] For those of you who are curious, the world record is 54 and one half hot dogs. Wow! And you know what? I personally have cooked up enough so each and every one of you could break that record. So shoot for the stars, OK? Alright, the team that eats the most hot dogs in ten minutes will be declared the winner. On you mark. Get set.",3,22,52
Michael," No, I have the only one. I claimed it. Ready?",3,22,52
Michael," Guys, guys, guys. Come on! Pleeeeease… Let’s just… OK, it’s very important that you all try to eat as many hot dogs as you can. On your mark. Get set. Eat!",3,22,52
Michael," No mustard, no mustard. Just eat it, eat it, Phyllis. Dip it in the water so it’ll slide down your gullet more easily.",3,22,52
Michael," Come on, the winner gets a big, big prize.",3,22,52
Michael," The winner gets a regional manager’s salary for a year, and a Sebring, and the feeling that they are making a difference in the world.",3,22,52
Michael, The winner of today gets my job. Ok? I’m interviewing for a job at corporate. And they’re only interviewing a handful of people and I’m the most qualified and I’ll probably get it. Alright? ,3,22,52
Michael, I didn’t want to tell anyway. I didn’t want to cast a pall over our fun beach day. But you know what? I don’t know who to recommend because frankly nobody is stepping up. ,3,22,52
Michael, [points at Stanley] Word. [Stanley starts eating hot dog] There we go. Let’s see it.  				,3,22,52
Michael," Four. Three. Two. One. Stop your eating! And the winner is Andy Bernard, with 14 hot dogs!",3,22,52
Michael, It’s very simple. There are only three rules. You must not touch the ground. You must not step outside of the ring. And you must always wear the safety mittens. ,3,22,52
Michael, Probably left them in the trunk of my car. It’s alright.  It’s alright. Here we go. ,3,22,52
Michael," I knew that finding a successor would be difficult. I did not know that it would be impossible. Thus far the candidates have been wildly disappointing. Uh, Jim is not taking it seriously. Uh, Stanley is having a stroke. And Andy, where is he? Where the hell is Andy? Where is he, Pam? Do you know? Ah… who’s ahead in points? ",3,22,52
Michael, Check to see if there is a conversion chart in that notebook. ,3,22,52
Michael, What does a great manager need most of all? Courage. ,3,22,52
Michael," Your loss, Stanley. Meanwhile the rest of us will have a super fun time defeating our fear and creating a lasting memory. Walking through FIRE!  				",3,22,52
Michael, Who among you has the guts to replace me? Let him walk across these coals. ,3,22,52
Michael," No. No, not you, Pam. You have to keep score. ",3,22,52
Michael," Blah, blah, blee blup, blup, okay? This is about guts. It takes guts to be a regional manager. Jim, you’re up. ",3,22,52
Michael, You do not have what it takes to be a regional manager. ,3,22,52
Michael, Who’s next? Andy? Where’s Andy? Andy is never here today.   				,3,22,52
Michael, Because I already did. Remember? I burned my foot on a George Foreman grill.,3,22,52
Michael," Alright. Okay. Alright. Fine. ‘kay. [clears throat, breathes noisily] The mind has to wrap around the foot. [exhales] Okay. ",3,22,52
Michael," Count the other way. Count… no, no, count one, two, three, not three, two, one. ",3,22,52
Michael, Wait! Am I going on go? Or am I going on three? ,3,22,52
Michael," Being the boss is also about image.  I’ve never looked like that. That was gross. I just, I don’t see the connection between a firewalk and management. Worst seventy-five bucks I ever spent. You know what, if I had to pick my replacement based on today, it would be Mr. “Outside Hire.”",3,22,52
Michael," Yeah.  Ummm, hmm… True.  Look, I don’t want to leave this branch that I love to an outside hire therefore we are going to have a one hundred point winner take all sudden death tribal council round. To test the aspect of my job that I think is the most important, something I call the Bob Hope factor. ",3,22,52
Michael," Oh, I love that movie. Yes, Kelly is right, the person to replace me has to have a great sense of humor and they have to possess the leadership qualities of a Bynes or a Hope.  So without further ado, Jim and Dwight show us what you got. ",3,22,52
Michael," Hhhh… okay. That is not funny. I am deducting sixty points from Voldemort for false pretenses. Okay, Dwight your turn. Wow us. ",3,22,52
Michael," Pam, that was amazing. But I am still looking for someone with a sales background.   				",3,22,52
Michael," Yes. I just happened to be in the neighborhood, thought I’d drop in and say hello. ",3,23,53
Michael," Naaah. You know what? Since I’m here, let me ask you a few questions about the job. ",3,23,53
Michael," Um, how many people are you interviewing? ",3,23,53
Michael," Ah, well, good. Out of curiosity are you interviewing anyone who has been here longer than I have, or manages more people?   ",3,23,53
Michael, Great. One more… question. When you merged those branches who did you put in charge? ,3,23,53
Michael, And I’m really looking forward to working with you.   				,3,23,53
Michael," I got it made in the shade. I know this company. The other branch managers are total morons. [on cell phone] Hey, Pam yeah, I forgot what day the interview was and I drove to New York accidentially. I’ll be like three hours late.   				",3,23,53
Michael," Yes, the time has come to name my own replacement. So please hand this letter of congratulations to Dwight K. Schrute. ",3,23,53
Michael," No, um, well I was thinking that uh, actually we could all leave tomorrow and do a convoy you know?  Convoys are really fun.  Pull up next to each other, give each other the finger… ",3,23,53
Michael," There they are, the Accounting Department. I shall miss your humility and your promptly printed checks. ",3,23,53
Michael," No. Not at all. I haven’t talked to Jan since we broke up, and I think if she had something to say she would have called me. ",3,23,53
Michael," No, no, no. You know what? It’s a done deal. I basically have the job already. There’s nothing she can do to stop it now. I already sold my condo.",3,23,53
Michael," I sold it on eBay. The buyer was very motivated, as was I. It went for eighty percent of what I paid.  Sold in record time.   				",3,23,53
Michael," I’m good. How are you, Janet? It’s good to see you.",3,23,53
Michael," Okay, sure, fine. Um, why don’t you wait in my office. I have some important business matters to take care of. ",3,23,53
Michael," Pam, Defcon ten. Houston, we have a problem. ",3,23,53
Michael," Uh, I may need some immediate assistance. If you would slowly and quietly gather the ladies in the conference room. Phyllis, Angela, Karen. ",3,23,53
Michael," Weird. Yeah, I didn’t get both of your messages.   				",3,23,53
Michael, Defcon twenty.  She wants to get back together. ,3,23,53
Michael," I don’t know, that’s why you’re here, help me. Please…",3,23,53
Michael, She made me do a lot of things I didn’t wanna do. ,3,23,53
Michael, You’re right. You’re absolutely right. I’m gonna go in there and tell her that we can’t be together. ,3,23,53
Michael, I’m in a very good place right now. Thank you.   				,3,23,53
Michael," [walks back into office with Jan] Okay. [clears throat] Jan, we need to talk. [Jan turns revealing that she has had her breasts enlarged]  				",3,23,53
Michael," Jan is in a different place right now, and it is a sign of maturity to give people second chances. So I am going to hear her out.   				",3,23,53
Michael, Let’s get back together. [Jan smiles and laughs]  				,3,23,53
Michael," No.  No, no, no, no.  I’ll tell you this, it is ",3,23,53
Michael," So, I guess we’re getting back together. ",3,23,53
Michael," Your advice was good, but Jan’s was bigger.   				",3,23,53
Michael," Here’s the sitch. Two weeks ago, I was in the worst relationship of my life.  She treated me poorly.  We didn’t connect, I was miserable. Now, I’m in the best relationship of my life with the same woman.  Love is a mystery.  				",3,23,53
Michael," Hey, everybody.  The next time you see me, I’ll be working for corporate. Starting tomorrow, Dwight Schrute will be running the branch. So without further ado,  [clicks on small tape player] I would like to start saying my goodbyes [Song: Thank You, by Natalie Merchant plays in background] Okay. Goodnight, and good luck.   				",3,23,53
Michael, [exhales] How are you guys doing?  Need anything?,3,23,53
Michael," I have been here a bunch of times, so I know where everything is, know everybody’s names.  If you need to know somebody’s name, just ask me.",3,23,53
Michael," No, no, no, just… that’s not his real name.  That’s just what I call him, so…  				",3,23,53
Michael," I am by far the most qualified person they’re interviewing.  Jim and Karen are here, which is cute.  They’re like, kid actors tagging along with daddy, on the big audition, hoping to be discovered.  Except daddy… is the best actor around.  Daddy is Meryl Streep.  				",3,23,53
Michael,"  Hey!  Hunter!  Wha’s up my brutha?  This is Hunter, secretary extraordinaire.",3,23,53
Michael," Could you give her a message for me, when she gets in?",3,23,53
Michael," Just say, “I want to squeeze them.”  It’s code.  She’ll know what it means.",3,23,53
Michael," Oh, and Hunter?  Could you tell her, [Michael shakes his head and makes the “motorboat” noise] “Brbrbrbrbr!” also?  				",3,23,53
Michael, Good to see you.  Here are the post-merger performance stats that you asked for.,3,23,53
Michael, Why don’t I tell you what my greatest weaknesses are?  I work too hard.  I care too much.  And sometimes I can be too invested in my job.,3,23,53
Michael," Well, my weaknesses are actually… strengths.",3,23,53
Michael," I’ve never been a big fan of the name Dunder Mifflin.  I was thinking we could name the company something like, “Paper Great.  Where great paper is our passion.  We’re GRRRRRRRRRREAT!”  I don’t know, could be good.  Or, uh, “Super Duper Paper.  It’s super duper.”  I don’t know, something like that.",3,23,53
Michael," Yes.  And I am very excited about the prospect of working under her… or on top of her. [laughs] Mm, that’s not sexual, just… we’re all professionals.",3,23,53
Michael," I don’t understand. So, we’re gonna tag team it?",3,23,53
Michael, Cool.  Maybe you should do it sooner rather than later.,3,23,53
Michael," Daaah, let’s just run away together.  Let’s just run away to Jamaica and live in a bungalow.  You have some savings right?  You could pay off my debts.  It would… be fine.  We’d have fun. ",3,23,53
Michael," So, I am gonna… give her a ride home.  Let me know about the job.",3,23,53
Michael," Good, I’m glad we’re on the same page.  I have a lot of ideas for new directions.",3,23,53
Michael," You know what?  That… is actually good… because, um, I don’t think I could take… my girlfriend’s job.  That’s not being a good boyfriend.  So, I respectfully withdraw my name from consideration.  Do you accept my withdrawal?",3,23,53
Michael," Good.  Very good.  I’m glad we are finally on the same page.  Still have my job in Scranton, though.",3,23,53
Michael, Good.  That’s all I ever wanted.  These two. [points at Jim and Karen] Either one of them… excellent candidates.  				,3,23,53
Michael," I know.  I know, I’m sorry about that.  That was terrible.",3,23,53
Michael," Well, it’s… [Jan starts crying, high pitched whining] No, don’t cry, it’s gonna be OK.",3,23,53
Michael, [whispers] I don’t know.  [normal volume] Well I guess… you could come and stay at my condo.  I think I could back out of the sale. [Jan exhales] Probably get some negative feedback on my eBay profile.,3,23,53
Michael," [in the office, imitating the terminator] I’ll be baaaaack!  And I am baaaack!",3,23,53
Michael," No.  No, Pam.  I’m baaaaaack!  For gooood!  Kevin Nealon.  				",3,23,53
Michael," Everybody, may I have your attention please?  It is with great honor and privilege that I announce to you that I have officially withdrawn my name for consideration from the corporate job.  I know, I know, I know.  “Michael, what are you thinking?  You were a shoe in.”  Well, got down there.  I nailed the interview.  And the strangest thing happened.  Why is my office black?",3,23,53
Michael," You shouldn’t have taken it.  Bad management!  Good thing I’m baaaaaack.  [laughs] Ryan, coffee.",3,23,53
Michael," So I’m back.  And I am never, ever going to leave.  I am going nowhere.  This place… is like… the hospital where I was born, my house, my old age home, and my… graveyard… for my bones.",3,23,53
Michael, [to everyone] Back to work. [to Ryan] Still waitin’ on that coffee.  				,3,23,53
Michael, Ladies and Gentlemen. I have some bad news. Meredith was hit by a car.,4,1,55
Michael," It happened this morning in the parking lot. I took her to the hospital, and the doctors tried to save her life. They did the best that they could… And she is going to be OK.",4,1,55
Michael," Yes. She has a slight pelvical fracture, but, ah… people have survived far worse.",4,1,55
Michael, Gah. Kind of a good news bad news there. I was able to be on the scene so quickly because I was in the car that hit her.,4,1,55
Michael," Yeah, it’s only Meredith, thank God. But did you see the way they looked at me? Like I was a murderer or something.",4,1,55
Michael," So Ryan got promoted to corporate, where he is a little fish in a big pond. Whereas back here in Scranton I am still top dog, in a fairly large pond. So who is the real boss? The dog or a fish?  				",4,1,55
Michael, So I need a little treat for the gang. Something to win their affections back.,4,1,55
Michael," No, I was being negligent. But she’s in the hospital, she’s fine, recovering nicely. Tiny little crack in her pelvis. But she will be up in…",4,1,55
Michael," Yes. It was on company property, with company property, so… double jeopardy, we are fine.",4,1,55
Michael," Oh, right, I’m sorry. What is: we are fine?",4,1,55
Michael," No! That is not funny, I love my employees, even thought I hit one of you with my car. For which I take full responsibility. Look I’m just trying to take everybody’s mind off of this unavoidable tragedy, and onto more positive things. So I thought we should plant a tree.",4,1,55
Michael," Ok, good good, so we’ll just all go down there together at lunch.",4,1,55
Michael," Yaaaaaay, Pam! Alright, since I am the boss I will drive as well. Who wants shotgun?",4,1,55
Michael," Everyone inside the car was fine, Stanley!  				",4,1,55
Michael," Guess what, I have flaws. What are they? Oh, I don’t know. I sing in the shower. Sometimes I spend too much time volunteering. Occasionally I’ll hit somebody with my car. So sue me… No, don’t sue me. That is the opposite of the point that I’m trying to make.  				",4,1,55
Michael, Eww. I hate hospitals. In my mind they are associated with sickness. Oh… She looks like an angel.,4,1,55
Michael," No… OK, she always looks like that… That is not my fault.",4,1,55
Michael," OK… Meredith, [hauntingly] Ooooohhhhh. I brought all your friends from the office dear.",4,1,55
Michael," Brought you some balloons. Why don’t we… here you go. [wraps them around her IV] Tie these up, cheer up your tubes… [IV pops out] Oh! Shhhh… For God’s sake!",4,1,55
Michael, [groaning] I am going to be sick… I’m gonna puke.,4,1,55
Michael," Oh, OK… Wait up, wait up, guys guys guys, hold on a second. You know what I was thinking might be sort of fun? Is if you forgave me in front of everybody.",4,1,55
Michael, Cause you know what they say in the Bible about forgiveness? Forgiveness is next to Godliness.,4,1,55
Michael," Look, I just… I don’t understand what is preventing you from laughing this off and giving me a big hug.",4,1,55
Michael, Come on. [starts to climb onto the bed with meredith.,4,1,55
Michael, Do I need to be liked? Absolutely not. I like to be liked. I enjoy being liked. I have to be liked. But it’s not like a compulsive need to be liked. Like my need to be praised.  				,4,1,55
Michael," OK, you know what? Everybody, let’s just get over the whole Meredith thing. She cracked her pelvis, a tiny little crack. She going to be fine, so let’s just…",4,1,55
Michael," [sighs] Oh, sh… I’m sorry Angela. Man what a day huh? How could it get any worse? Her computer crashes with the porn, and then Meredith with the accident, and then… Sprinkles! God, that’s 3 things. I’ll tell you what’s going on. This office is cursed, and we need to do something about it.  				",4,1,55
Michael," Well, I am taking responsibility. It is up to me to get rid of the curse that hit Meredith with my car. I’m not superstitious, but… I’m… I am a little-stitious.  				",4,1,55
Michael, Did anyone do anything involving an Indian burial ground?,4,1,55
Michael, Like park on it. Or dig up a body… Toby? Anything you want to tell us?,4,1,55
Michael, Perfect. So our tragedy is your good luck. Satan.,4,1,55
Michael," Dwight, you haven’t seen Meredith yet, have you?",4,1,55
Michael," Well, I think you should go to the hospital, and pay your respects.",4,1,55
Michael," Alright, I would now like to talk about each of your individual religious beliefs.",4,1,55
Michael, Satan is a master of lies. Everything he says is the opposite.,4,1,55
Michael," Thank you for the permission. Psych! Alright let’s just go around the room, and tell me what you believe in.",4,1,55
Michael," Kelly, you are Hindu, so you believe in Buddha.",4,1,55
Michael," You spend your whole life trying to get people to like you, and then you run over one person with your car. [sighs] And it’s not even one of the popular ones, and everybody gets on your case. Doesn’t make any sense… God is dead.",4,1,55
Michael," Maybe believing in God was the mistake. What did people believe in before? The sun? Maybe there’s some sort of animal, that we could make a sacrifice too. Like a giant buffalo, or some sort of monster, like something with the body of a walrus with the head of a sea lion. Or something with the body of an egret with the head of a meerkat. Or just… the head of a monkey, with the antlers of a reindeer, with, ah… the body of a porcupine. ",4,1,55
Michael," I was in the hospital room with her. How contagious is that, is that like an STD?",4,1,55
Michael," [walks out into the office] I know a lot of you are upset with me for endangering Meredith’s life by hitting her, with my car. But it may make you feel a little better to know that before that happened, Dwight endangered her life, by putting a garbage bag over her head that had a bat in it.",4,1,55
Michael," Turns out Meredith has been exposed to rabies. Which is like 10 times worse than a little crack in your pelvis. Thanks to me she went to the hospital and I saved her life. Curse is broken. Curse is broken people! [Kevin claps] Oh… there is a God, and he has a plan for us after all. So go home get some rest, very very good work today. We got a lot accomplished.  				",4,1,55
Michael," Is there a God? If not, what are all the churches for? And who is Jesus’ dad?  				",4,1,55
Michael," A woman shouldn’t have to be hit by a car, to learn that she may have rabies. But that is where we are in America. And that does not sit right with me. And that is why I’m hosting a fun run race for the cure for rabies. To raise awareness of the fact that there is a cure for rabies. A disease that has largely been eradicated in the US. But not very many people know that.  				",4,1,55
Michael," Come on man, gotta step it up! It’s for a good cause. Jan called this morning and pledged $500.00.",4,1,55
Michael," That… is for a good cause. Phyllis, how’s the rabies quilt coming?",4,1,55
Michael," Oh, look at that, 3. Way to honor Meredith, Phyllis.",4,1,55
Michael, I know that you’re probably scared of people seeing your fat legs in shorts.,4,1,55
Michael," OK, well back in olden times, a large fat person, like this, was a person of power. A person who had money, could buy food, person of respect. Like the regional manager of the day. Whereas, someone athletic and trim, like myself, was someone who worked in the fields… And I was a peasant.",4,1,55
Michael," Well, you’re going to have to run, or you’re going to be in a lot of trouble. It is not olden times anymore.  				",4,1,55
Michael," We have raised, almost $700.00, most of it from me and Jan. Um… when do they put that on the giant check? Or is that something that we write in later?",4,1,55
Michael, Hmm… That’s a tough decision. Um… I always imagined it with a giant check. So…,4,1,55
Michael, You didn’t contribute very much. I was also hoping to hand the giant check to a rabies doctor. And how’s that been going?,4,1,55
Michael, Have you met that kid? He’s not going to college.  				,4,1,55
Michael, See how I did that. That’s the way you should enter a room. You knock and then you wait for the all clear.,4,1,55
Michael," Yes, but I have an office, so why would I do that.",4,1,55
Michael, European offices are naked all the time.,4,1,55
Michael, Besides my shirt tail covered most of it so…,4,1,55
Michael," That’s not gross, it is the human body. What is your problem? Pam you’re an artist, right? Think of me as one of your models. OK, you know what, I don’t want this to detract from what we really need to be thinking about today, it’s not fair to people with rabies. And that’s the point, right? OK, let’s go have some fun.",4,1,55
Michael," Check that out. [points to Toby] Look at me, I’m Toby, I’m stretching, I know what I’m doing. Why is he even here?  				",4,1,55
Michael," OK everybody, listen up. Thank you for coming. Before we get started I wanted to say a few words about this deadly disease called rabies. And I’d like you to take a look into the face of rabies. [turns around a picture of Meredith in the hospital] That should scare you. It scares me. You people need to educate yourselves. Myth: 3 Americans every year die from rabies. Fact: 4 Americans every year die from rabies. How many of you know someone who has been afflicted or affected by rabies? Show of hands. One, two, three… too many to count. It is truly the silent killer. No, it is the foaming barking killer. And it is something… Darryl what are you doing.",4,1,55
Michael," No, don’t give him… just, did you hear anything I said?",4,1,55
Michael," He’s happy because he’s insane. You know what, that’s the perfect example of the kind of awareness we need to generate. Where’s the nurse? [Elizabeth walks up in nurse’s outfit] This is the reason we’re here.",4,1,55
Michael," Right? Wow, very cool you went back and got your degree. I would like you to accept this check, for $340.00 made out to science. Make sure that, that gets into the right hands.",4,1,55
Michael," OK, fettuccine alfredo, time to carbo-load.  				",4,1,55
Michael," Just remember folks, it’s not about winning, it is about finishing.",4,1,55
Michael," I am fast! I’m very fast! I’m like Forrest Gump, except I am not an idiot. [Creed, Stanley, and Oscar get into a cab]  				",4,1,55
Michael," No, no water for me. Not while rabies causes fear of water… solidarity!",4,1,55
Michael, Rabies victims… have to live with an irrational hatred of water their entire lives. So… least I could do.  				,4,1,55
Michael, That fettuccine is sitting in my stomach like a rock.,4,1,55
Michael," [laughs] Excellent! …Simpsons. Wait, Imodium or Ex-lax?  				",4,1,55
Michael," [Burp] Oh God, Oh, alfredo sauce. I’m getting a stitch. [groans]  				",4,1,55
Michael, [runs by] Take bat bites seriously. Don’t get bit.,4,1,55
Michael," [bent over] I am not going to finish. I can’t beat rabies. Nobody can beat rabies, rabies has been around for a thousand years. I was a fool to think that I could beat it. [Creed,Stanley, and Oscar pass by in the cab and get out at the finish line]  				",4,1,55
Michael," I can’t finish. I feel so weak, I just…",4,1,55
Michael," No, There are people all over the world, who have all sorts of problems and afflictions, and diseases. They’re deformed, and they’re abnormal, and… they’re illiterate and ugly. Symphonies don’t have any money. Public TV is bust. I can’t do anything about it, I can’t… you know. There’s just one of me, and there’s a thousand of them. And rabies wins.",4,1,55
Michael," Pam, if everybody felt that way, nothing would get done.",4,1,55
Michael," You just don’t think I am capable, of making a difference.",4,1,55
Michael," You don’t, you don’t know me. You’ve just seen my penis. I can make a difference, remember, I’m the one who started this whole thing off by hitting Meredith with my car. And I owe it to her to finish this… GD 5k [gets up groaning, Jim tries to help] No, no!  				",4,1,55
Michael," Finishing that 5k, was the hardest thing I have ever had to do. I ate more fettuccine alfredo and drank less water, than I have in my entire life. People always talk about triumphs of the human spirit, well today I had a triumph of the human body. That’s why everybody was applauding for me at the end. My guts and my heart, and while I eventually puked my guts out, I never puked my heart out. And I’m very, very proud of that.  				",4,1,55
Michael," It’s ironic isn’t it? I mean I’m in the hospital for not getting enough water, and you’re in it for a disease that causes the fear of water.",4,1,55
Michael," Thanks, I’m not mad at you anymore. [sighs, takes sucker out of his mouth] Wanna share?",4,1,55
Michael," I’m not really sick. [Meredith takes a lick and hands back to Michael] Nah, I’m good.  				",4,1,55
Michael, Hey Toby. What’s this? [holds up memo Toby has passed out to the staff],4,2,56
Michael, [reads memo] I just want to remind everyone about the company rules involving PDA or public displays of affection.,4,2,56
Michael," Is this about me and Jan? In my office? Because I will have you know that that was consensual. What we did has nothing to do with you or anyone here. I don’t think. I don’t think anyone heard anything. We were very discreet and, and most people had left by that point. So I don’t think it’s any of your business. What I think you should do is roll up the memo, real tight…",4,2,56
Michael," Oh kay, mind is exploding. Get over here. [gestures to Pam to get up] Come on. Come here. Okay, okay, [to Jim] stand up. [Jim moves over in chair] OK, here we go. [holding both Pam and Jim’s hand] Everyone, this is a day that will live in infamy. Because today, is the day that Jim and Pam become one.",4,2,56
Michael," No, no, no Pam let ’em ring. Let the bells of Dunder Mifflin chime out your love. Because this is [starts to well up] really good, this is really good. My heart soars with the eagles nest.  				",4,2,56
Michael, Hey. Can you make that straighter? That’s what she said.,4,2,56
Michael," No. [tries to hide piece of paper, but Pam grabs it]",4,2,56
Michael, Pam and Jim are together. Ryan is visiting. Only thing that could make this day better is ice cream.  				,4,2,56
Michael," There he is! There he is! He’s back! And he’s with a beard. [laughing] He… He has facial hair. Look at him! All grown up and no place to go. Hello, Mr. Sunny Crockett. I’m Tubs.",4,2,56
Michael," Ohh, yeah, let’s get started because uh, yes, cause uh this is very serious business and umm..",4,2,56
Michael," Look how big he is. Look at you, you are so mature and old and little man now. You’re like our little man…",4,2,56
Michael, That’s a little kinky. I don’t swing that way.,4,2,56
Michael, Woooo![laughs] I think Ryan has a gay crush on me.,4,2,56
Michael," Yes, everybody, come on. Settle town. Let’s get serious here. Um Ryan, has a very special, important presentation to do, which we will be doing in the conference room in [looks at Ryan] 10 minutes?",4,2,56
Michael," Yeah, Ryan snapped at me, but there was this twinkle in his eye that I picked up on, which said, “Dude, we’re friends. I’m doing this for appearances. I am the big boss now. And I have to seem like an ogre. But you know me and you trust me. And we like each other. And we’ll always be friends. And I would never take you for granted in a million years. And I miss you, man. And I love you.” His words.  				",4,2,56
Michael," OOhh. Gimmme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.",4,2,56
Michael, Ryan Howard everybody. [starts clapping] Good job. [everyone gets up to leave],4,2,56
Michael, I am not old. You are old. You are like a hundred.,4,2,56
Michael," Yeah, kay. I was just… After the presentation, just wanted to make sure, that vis-a-vie, that everything in the office is business as usual?",4,2,56
Michael," Yeah, I know I understand… we’re making great strides and we’re updating, but business as usual, no?",4,2,56
Michael," We had a foreign exchange student live with us when I was young. And we called him my brother. And that’s who I thought he was. Um, then he went home to what is now formerly Yugoslavia, taking all of my blue jeans with him. And I had to spend the entire winter in shorts. That is what Ryan is like. A fake brother who steals your jeans.  				",4,2,56
Michael," [holds up Blackberry] Hey, what is the actual deal with these things in terms of testicles?",4,2,56
Michael, I don’t want to grow weird sperm in case we ever want to have kids.,4,2,56
Michael," Oh, I dunno, they’re launching a big new business plan. New website, blah blah blah. He’s being a real twerp about it, so, it’s all about youth, and agility and streamlining and trying to squeeze out the older people.",4,2,56
Michael, So older people have just as many rights as younger people?,4,2,56
Michael," Good, we’re all here, we can get started.",4,2,56
Michael," Still my office, Ryan. [Ryan sits down] Well, there has been a lot of talk about new ideas today. Well, new ideas are fine, but they are also… illegal, because they are a form of ageism. What? Yes, I am right. Did you know that the Age Discrimination and Employment Act of 1967 prohibits employment discrimination based on age with respect to employees 40 years of age or older? I did.",4,2,56
Michael," Hey, shut up Toby. Look, why do we as a society hate old people so much?",4,2,56
Michael," No, Creed, no they are not. In fact, many cultures revere old people because of their storytelling ability. Like the old lady from Titanic. [points to her picture on the wall] Or the funny things that they can do, like “where’s the Beef?” [points to another picture on wall] [Jim raises his hand] Yeah.",4,2,56
Michael," I was going to put up some new pictures, but umm, all of the ink in the printer was gone.",4,2,56
Michael," [puts hand up] That is me. Come on in. [They shake hands] Who is this old fart? Did you just stagger off the street? Out of a box or something? Who’s this worthless bag of bones? Well, this guy is none other than one of the founders of Dunder Mifflin, Mr. Robert Dunder. Huh? [starts clapping, others join in]",4,2,56
Michael, Sure thing. [both go out of conference room] ‘Scuse me. [closes door]  				,4,2,56
Michael, Fine. Then I will call David Wallace and you can explain to him why you threw the founder of the company out on his ancient butt. [they glare at each other]  				,4,2,56
Michael," Eighty-seven years young. And still active. That is great. Did you know, that Bob is still a member of the Board of Dunder Mifflin?",4,2,56
Michael," Ah, still sends his own proxy. Good for you.  				",4,2,56
Michael, That’s great. Thank you for coming in. [starts ushering him out] Robert Dunder everybody. [clapping] Thank you. That was wonderful. Do you have a ride?,4,2,56
Michael," Inspirational. What have we learned?  Well, we have learned that you can’t teach an old dog new tricks, because it’s illegal, and you will go to jail. [Pam raises hand]",4,2,56
Michael," No, No. Don’t help him. He doesn’t need help, Pam. [Jim nods head and Pam gets up and leaves to help Robert Dunder, Michael shows Robert thumbs up] What a nice guy.  				",4,2,56
Michael, Good night guys. [staff leaves the office],4,2,56
Michael," I disagree, I think it was very valuable.",4,2,56
Michael, I happen to think the old ways of doing business are better. And I can prove it.,4,2,56
Michael,  We have a lot of colored paper here… why oh why do we keep printing this on white? [screen saver box hits the wall],4,3,57
Michael," Maybe, we could have some sort of riddle?",4,3,57
Michael," Like, something that you have to look for.  Sort of a “Where’s Waldo.” [screensaver box hits the corner of the screen]",4,3,57
Michael, [everyone gets up and leaves the conference room] Alright. Alright.  Let’s quit while we’re ahead.,4,3,57
Michael,  Some days I am just on fire.  What can I say?   				,4,3,57
Michael,"  Mmmmmm.  Okay.  Attention.  Earthlings.  I have some news.  Beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep.  Okay.  Today is the big day that I am heading to New York to attend a party with sushi and important people.  On an unrelated note, if anyone has an interesting anectdote that is not boring and easy to memorize please drop by my office before I leave.  Thank you.",4,3,57
Michael,  And… today the Dunder-Mifflin Infinity website officially launches.  				,4,3,57
Michael,"  Well the website is the brain-child of my brain-child, Ryan.  It is my brain-grandchild. And, uh, to celebrate it’s birth, all of the different branches are going to have satellite parties, which will be connected via web-cams and fibers to the real party, which is going on in New York City at uh, a very exclusive nightclub, and that is where all of the VIP’s, including yours truly, will be partying with uh New York City’s finest, and I do not mean policemen…   				",4,3,57
Michael,"  The company is projecting record high sales, and that by 6:00 the website will be the new best salesman in the company.  Wow!  Watch out Dwight.",4,3,57
Michael,  No.  It doesn’t.  I’ll find out tonight.,4,3,57
Michael," Okay, wow!  Easy, booster seat, nobody cares about this party anyway.",4,3,57
Michael,  Oh good.  Okay cool.  How many pounds do you think I could lose by 7?,4,3,57
Michael,  Why don’t you wanna go tonight?  What… all your friends are gonna be there.  It’ll be fun.,4,3,57
Michael,  Na… no.  No.  If I go by myself everybody will think I’m a big loser.  ,4,3,57
Michael,  Do I have your permission to invite Carol?,4,3,57
Michael,  I’m sorry. I’m sorry.  It’s just the first… girl that popped into my head.  I’ll find somebody I haven’t slept with.  				,4,3,57
Michael,  So.  This is the dealio.  God has smiled upon me and given me two tickets to the big party in New York tonight.  What are you doing this evening?  Look at that.  They have their own little language now. Like twins.,4,3,57
Michael,  Alright.  Well fight it out amongst yourselves.  I was thinking Pammy but boys night out is also good.,4,3,57
Michael,  Alright.  I’m ready to go and I’m callin’ shotgun.,4,3,57
Michael,"  Oh yeah, you’d better.  You better say good-bye to Pam.  Say good-bye to Pam.  Byyyyyye.  I love you.  [kissing noise, kissing noise]  I love ya Pam… okay.  [singing]  I’m leavin’ inside Jim’s car, I don’t know when I’ll be back again.  Yes I do.  Tomorrow I’ll be back.  I’ll be back.  Tomorrow.  Um… yeah.  So you know what?  Why don’t you guys take off a little bit early tonight?",4,3,57
Michael,"  If you are not this tall, you may not ride the rollercoaster.  See you guys tomorrow.",4,3,57
Michael,  You ever read this? [holds up Green Eggs and Ham],4,3,57
Michael,"  Got it for Ryan.  Wanted to get him Oh The Places You’ll Go, but they were sold out.  Figured… ",4,3,57
Michael,  You guys should come over for dinner.  You and Pam.  That’d be fun.  Friday?,4,3,57
Michael,"  Yes.  Actually I will tell you right now.  It’s a club called Chatroom, and there’s a password to get in, which is actually password.  So… ",4,3,57
Michael,"  Well the invitation says VIP’s only.  Is this how you treat your VIP’s, Ryan?  We’re already in the city.  The main part with the buildings.  What am I supposed to do?  What do you want me to do tonight?  And if you tell me, that I have to drive back to Scranton, to the satellite party, I am going to throw up!  Okay I’m going to throw up.  I’m throwing up.  You’re making me throw up, Ryan.  				",4,3,57
Michael,  You know what this is like?  I’ll tell you what this is like. This is like when the Freshmen would throw a party and wouldn’t let any of the Seniors go.  				,4,3,57
Michael,  Doesn’t it just piss you off sometimes that that little twerp got the promotion over us?,4,3,57
Michael,"  Ohhh, what?  Oh I think I faked Oscar out.",4,3,57
Michael,  I think I faked Stanley out too.  Who else thought that I was leaving?  And they could all go home early?  Gotcha.  Gotcha.  Gotcha.  Well who needs New York?  Right?  We can have a killer party right here in Scranton.,4,3,57
Michael,  Nope nope nope no.  This is going to be nothing like the party you’ve been planning.  This is going to be good and everybody’s gonna come.  What’s wrong with Dwight?,4,3,57
Michael,  Oh hey!  Good for you.  Good for you.  Scranton power.  Alright you know what?  Angela I’d like you to come into my office in ten minutes. Bring something to write with and something to write on.  Good.  				,4,3,57
Michael,"  This was a pretty disappointing day.  It was kind of a slap in the face to realize that I wasn’t as important as I thought I was to a certain young executive who I cared about.  But, you know, I’m not gonna cry over it.  I did that in the car on the way home.  				",4,3,57
Michael,  Good.  These are some things that I would like to have happen.,4,3,57
Michael,  Those are just things.  This is how I want it to feel. ,4,3,57
Michael,"  I would like this party to be sexier, cooler, more important… ",4,3,57
Michael,"  I want it to embarrass all other parties.  I want it to be a party that the guys in New York watch on the web-cam and say, “Wow! How did they get Al Roker to come?”",4,3,57
Michael,  Yes you can.  I know you can.  I wouldn’t say that if I didn’t hundred percent believe it.  Who else could do this?,4,3,57
Michael,  No seriously.  Is there anyone else who could do it better?  Because we don’t have a lot of time.  I’ll get the pizza!  				,4,3,57
Michael," Guess who just ordered from your favorite pizza place, Alfredo?",4,3,57
Michael, You know what?  I don’t understand when you all talk at the same time.,4,3,57
Michael," Okay, okay, what’s better?  A medium amount of good pizza?  Or all you can eat of pretty good pizza?",4,3,57
Michael," Right, I have a coupon, so half of sixty-three fifty, and half the tip of sixty-three fifty.",4,3,57
Michael," Yeah, I told them on the phone that I was ordering eight pizzas.",4,3,57
Michael, You didn’t actually think I was going to spend sixty bucks on pizza?,4,3,57
Michael," Okay, it doesn’t say it anywhere on the coupon, and if it’s policy, it should say it on the coupon.",4,3,57
Michael, [sarcastic shrugging of shoulders] What do you mean hmm-um?,4,3,57
Michael," It is your problem.  That’s no way to do business, okay? I ordered eight pizzas with a half-off coupon, so I would like eight pizzas for half-off.  End of story.",4,3,57
Michael,"  No, no you’re not going anywhere.  You’re staying here until we figure this out.",4,3,57
Michael," You know what?  This young man needs to learn that’s not how you treat people.  I don’t care if it’s pizza.  Good business is about respect and accountability and follow through.  You don’t just make promises and pull the rug out from under somebody, do you?  Dwight, please escort this young man into the conference room.  Right now, get in the conference room.",4,3,57
Michael," Yes you are, yes you are, and you will come out when you decide to give me a discount on the pizza.  Please, thank you.",4,3,57
Michael," No, you don’t even know what stupid is.  It’s about to get all stupid up in here.  				",4,3,57
Michael," Okay, what have you been doing in here this whole time?",4,3,57
Michael," Alright, Dwight, knock it off.  You better think about what you are doing young man.",4,3,57
Michael," No!  I’m an adult, I don’t have to think or do anything.  You’re a kid, a little snot-nosed, punk kid who thinks he’s better than everyone else, because he’s some hot shot, and you don’t know anything about sales.  So stop being a disrespectful little jerk, okay?",4,3,57
Michael," Yeah sales, you sell pizza.  Last time I checked that’s called sales.",4,3,57
Michael," Alright stop, stop making him say it!  You just made this worse, a whole lot worse.",4,3,57
Michael, Let go of the little jerk boy before he has learned his lesson?,4,3,57
Michael," You know what Jim, the world would be a better place if people were held accountable for their actions.",4,3,57
Michael," I’m not kidnapping him, I’m keeping him until I get what I want.",4,3,57
Michael," Yes, is Alfredo there?  Can I speak to a manager then?  Okay, can you tell the manager that I’m keeping his delivery kid until I get a discount on the eight pizzas I ordered.  Yes, I know it is not on the coupon.  Also I would like him to throw in two, three pizzas for our…",4,3,57
Michael," Hey, I just think you should know that one of my salesmen beat your stupid computer, so take that [bleep]hole.",4,3,57
Michael," Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you doing?",4,3,57
Michael," Hey, hey, hey stop it.  Stop it now, God. Oh my God, oh my God, no, no, no.  I kidnapped a kid.",4,3,57
Michael," [to Dwight] Mmm-kay.  I want you to go in there, and pay him for the pizzas, and give him a generous tip, no more than ten percent.",4,3,57
Michael," And hopefully he will walk out, and the rest is out of our hands.",4,3,57
Michael," Now we wait, and hopefully nothing happens.",4,3,57
Michael," Not now Dwight, please, it’s not the time.  				",4,3,57
Michael," Well, I need to get the horrible taste of this pizza out of my mouth.  I’d really like some sushi.  I was hoping that I would have New York style sushi today.  And you know what?",4,3,57
Michael," Uh-uh, no, there is only one place where they authentic New York style sushi.",4,3,57
Michael," Hey, you know what? [Michael and Dwight grab plates of sushi] Come on, come on, let’s go.",4,3,57
Michael," Oh, thanks.  This is the guy that beat the computer.",4,3,57
Michael," [mocking Ryan] I’m Ryan, and tonight didn’t go the way that I thought it would, because it didn’t work out for me, and I’m very embarrassed.  I got egg all over my face.",4,3,57
Michael," I never sold any paper, because I’m an idiot.",4,3,57
Michael," And I’m hot, I’m so hot. That’s why everybody…",4,3,57
Michael," Well, it’s part of it, it’s just the… uhhh.",4,3,57
Michael, Where’s Armani? He’s on the phone. Too slow. You are not going to Paris. I’m so much better than you are. [breaks into laughter]  ,4,4,58
Michael, Yeah. It was awesome. Big surprise ending. Won’t ruin it for you.,4,4,58
Michael," Meryl Streep is the bad guy. Never see it coming. Anyways, if I was mean in any way to you, I am sorry. I just want what’s best for you, Mo Chuisle.  ",4,4,58
Michael, I haven’t heard the same about you. So let’s just go with mine.,4,4,58
Michael, It… folds up. You’ve only seen it flat.,4,4,58
Michael," Yes. Money has been a little tight lately. But, at the end of my life, when I’m sitting on my yacht, am I gonna be thinking about how much money I have? No. I’m going to be thinking about how many friends I have, and my children, and my comedy albums. I mean, I have a yacht, so I obviously did pretty well money wise.  ",4,4,58
Michael, It’s just that you say it’s gonna cost what it costs— [phone rings],4,4,58
Michael," Yes, and thank you for sending that to me.",4,4,58
Michael," Okay, yeah, I dunno. I dunno, I think those IT guys messed up.",4,4,58
Michael," [looking at nothing] Wait, oh, no, here it is, here it is. Found it.  ",4,4,58
Michael," Use to have two cars, traded ’em in, now we’re down to one. Good economic sense. Although the new car is a Porsche. For her.  ",4,4,58
Michael," Dammit to hell. I-I-ugh, ok. All right.",4,4,58
Michael, You wouldn’t understand. It’s a secret.,4,4,58
Michael," I’m sorry Mr. O’Brian, I didn’t mean to interrupt your dinner. I just have a very exciting offer. My records indicate that you have expressed interest in losing some weight. Well, what if I told you that I have a pill that will make you 50 pounds lighter in 5 minutes? How does that sound? Amazing right? Well, it won’t be that fast, but it will–[notices camera]– it will be that easy.  ",4,4,58
Michael," I just love sales. I love it to death. It’s as simple as that. And I don’t get to do it enough as a manager, so I took this second job. I count it as a hobby. Some people have golf, or relaxing.",4,4,58
Michael," Hey, I just got off the phone, and I was gonna make another call. ",4,4,58
Michael," No, they’re with me, so… this is Nick Figaro, manager to the stars!  ",4,4,58
Michael, I’m just calling because you responded positively to the—,4,4,58
Michael," [Spanish accent] Senor, are you happy with your—",4,4,58
Michael, [speaking with a different voice] Have you— Have you considered satellite television?,4,4,58
Michael, Well your son sounds like he’s really motivated. I think it’s crazy the coach won’t play him frankly.,4,4,58
Michael," Look, I know sales, and I had that sale, I just needed a few more minutes—",4,4,58
Michael," Well, I hope this conversation has helped.  ",4,4,58
Michael, I am going with the vanilla crisp this evening.,4,4,58
Michael," I know, but it’s competitive here. What’s a dollar worth in your land? Medical school must cost like 40 bucks or a donkey or something.",4,4,58
Michael, I would’ve been chief of surgery… Or a cowboy.  ,4,4,58
Michael," You know what, here’s the thing about Die Hard 4. Die Hard one, the original, John McClane was just this normal guy. You know, he’s just a normal New York City cop, who gets his feet cut, and gets beat up. But he’s an everyday guy. In Die Hard 4, he is jumping a motorcycle into a helicopter. In air. You know? He’s invincible. It just sort of lost what Die Hard was. It’s not Terminator.",4,4,58
Michael," Thanks, no, I have work tomorrow morning.",4,4,58
Michael," Okay, see you guys. [Sees Jan] Hey, how you doin’?",4,4,58
Michael, Um… that wasn’t much of an introduction.,4,4,58
Michael," Ahh, still lame. Okay. All right. Thank you, Ryan, for that wonderful introduction. Okay, um, today we’re gonna be talking… about…PowerPoint! PowerPoint! PowerPoint! PowerPoint!  ",4,4,58
Michael," Yes I forgot about Ryan’s presentation. And yes, it would have been nice to do well with the first presentation he had given me. But you know what else would have been nice? Winning the lottery.   ",4,4,58
Michael," And the best way to start is to hit start. And up comes the toolbar, that’s what she said. What we have to do here is go to Run, and then you look up to PowerPoint. And we are in. We are going to register. You hit register— Updates are ready. I should update. Um, estimated time 12 minutes, so this should take 5 or 10 minutes. ",4,4,58
Michael," No, I had a really rough night, and my boss can back you up on that.",4,4,58
Michael, What I do between 5:30 pm and 1 am is no one’s business but mine and my other business’.,4,4,58
Michael," Okay, honestly, it was unlikely I was gonna figure this out anyways. [Kelly laughs]",4,4,58
Michael," Why don’t you do the presentation, because you know how to do it?",4,4,58
Michael," No one, uh, asked you anything ever, so whomever’s name is Toby, why don’t you take a letter opener and stick it into your skull.",4,4,58
Michael," I’ve never done this before. I’ve never quit anything in my life.  So, you are filming history.  ",4,4,58
Michael," Nick, I had a dream last night that I had two full time jobs.  One here at the Lipophedrazone diet pill company—",4,4,58
Michael, And the other I was a Regional Manager of a small paper supply company called Dunder Mifflin.,4,4,58
Michael," In this dream I did both of these jobs beautifully, and I loved it, and everybody loved me.  But the truth is, I can’t do this.",4,4,58
Michael," I was never in this for the money.  But it turns out that the money was an absolute necessity for me.  I tried to live the dream.  I tried to have a job, a girlfriend, another job, and I failed.  But the good thing about the American dream is that you can just go to sleep, and try it all again the next night.  ",4,4,58
Michael," Hey Kevin, you’re a gambler right?  A rounder, you play the ponies, small horses.",4,4,58
Michael," Yeah, I was thinking about doing some gambling myself.  You know, just a little bit of money.  Maybe doubling it, and them doubling it seven more times.  I don’t know, kind of just for fun.  I was thinking, do you have tips, or ideas about sure things.  Like a boxer who is going to throw the big fight, you know, like, like he’s tied into some crooked dealings, maybe his kid is sick or something.  Like, who do I call about that?",4,4,58
Michael," Okay, um, Oscar, I’m going to need to take another advance on my salary.  ",4,4,58
Michael," What’cha talking about?  [camera pans to each face in the break room]  Okay, I know what’s going on.  You’re talking about Jim and Pam, if they’re having sex, what it looks like, I know, I think—",4,4,58
Michael," Monkey problem? No, I’m not having monkey problems.  Why would I have monkey problems?",4,4,58
Michael, I don’t have a second job.  Maybe I’m having an affair with Suzanne Summers.,4,4,58
Michael," I don’t talk to my girlfriend about money.  It is rude, and unsexual.",4,4,58
Michael," I totally agree with you.  But I don’t have money problems, I don’t.  Alright, you know what?  Watch this, if I had money problems, would I do this? [Michael holds up a bill, crumples it up, puts it back in his pocket]",4,4,58
Michael," Yeah, but I destroyed it, it’s not even useable anymore.  ",4,4,58
Michael," How would that help Creed?  In Monopoly when you go bankrupt, you lose.",4,4,58
Michael," I’ve always wanted to be in the witness protection program.  Fresh start, no debts, no baggage.  I’ve already got my name picked out, Lord Rupert Everton.  I’m a shipping merchant who raises fancy dogs.  That’s the life.  ",4,4,58
Michael," You know, Jan has my credit cards, and she’s using them as if I’m made of money, she thinks I’m a human ATM machine.",4,4,58
Michael," Oh, that’s the Muppet Show, on DVD, classic.",4,4,58
Michael," That is by far the best way to strengthen your core.  This machine, you sit on a stabilizer ball, you put your feet into the power stir-ups, you reach up and you grab onto the super rod, and you twist, and you twist, and you twist.  It strengthens your entire core.  Your back core, your arm core, the Marine Core actually uses it.  I think that’s how they got a core.  ",4,4,58
Michael, Mm-hm.  That is so cool how you have my name at the top.,4,4,58
Michael, How do they do this so fast?  Is this power-point?  ,4,4,58
Michael," No, no, we are going to leave Jan out of this.",4,4,58
Michael," We will find another way, we’ll ask power-point.",4,4,58
Michael, You’re a presentation tool if you think I’m gonna tell Jan about this.,4,4,58
Michael," No you’re not! Ok, just… you’re not a tool. Look, we’ll tell her that it’s bad, but it could’ve been a lot worse but due to some fancy financial foot work I was able to cut it in half. ",4,4,58
Michael," Um, that’s, how did you get that from what Oscar’s saying?",4,4,58
Michael," What am I doing? I am blowing dodge. I’m getting out of town. Whatever you call it, I am running away from my responsibilities. And it feels good.  ",4,4,58
Michael," [singing] Runaway train, never come back.  Runaway and I’m never coming back.",4,4,58
Michael," I told you, no more answers.  This is who I am now.  A guy on a train with no answers.  I hope that can be enough for you.",4,4,58
Michael," Yeah it is, it is.  I really messed up.",4,4,58
Michael, Dancing babies! I love it! I love it!  				,4,5,59
Michael," We are making a commercial for Dunder Mifflin today. Our first ad ever.  Corporate purchased some air time in local markets to spread the word about Dunder Mifflin Infinity and they are even sending up a professional ad company to help us make it later so… it’s uh, not too shabby.  				",4,5,59
Michael," Okay, it’s football cream. It’s football cream. Alright! So, anybody else?",4,5,59
Michael," Look at that. Even the receptionist is getting in on the creativity. Very good, very good.  				",4,5,59
Michael," You know, I want this to be cutting edge. I want it to be fast, quick cuts, you know, youthful, sort of a MTV on crack kind of thing.",4,5,59
Michael," All right, good, well this is what we have to work with.",4,5,59
Michael, I would like you to meet Andrew Bernard. The ‘Nard Dog. Who let the ‘Nard Dog out? ,4,5,59
Michael, He gives the best back rubs in the office.,4,5,59
Michael, Now this gentleman right here is the key to our urban vibe.,4,5,59
Michael, Stanley is hilarious. Phyllis is like our Mrs. Butterworth. Kind of a less urban Aunt Jemima. ,4,5,59
Michael," These are our accountants. And as you can see they are very different sizes. What you might want to do is kind of a Papa Bear, Mama Bear, Baby Bear thing. That might be kind of fun.",4,5,59
Michael," [reading off piece of paper] Little girl in a field holding a flower, we zoom back to find that she’s in the desert and the field is an oasis. Zoom back further the desert is a sandbox in the world’s largest resort hotel. Zoom back further the hotel is actually the playground for the world’s largest prison.  But we zoom back further—",4,5,59
Michael," Actually I don’t get paid by the hour anymore, but thank you, I get paid by the year, so…",4,5,59
Michael," Mmm. Okay. [commercial plays on laptop, peppy music in background]",4,5,59
Michael, That’s what Nassau came up with? That sucks! [chuckles] Whoa.,4,5,59
Michael," [on speakerphone, Eddie Murphy voice] Shrek! Shrek, I’m a donkey! I’m a donkey, Shrek! [laughing] I’m just kidding. It’s me. Hello Ry. ",4,5,59
Michael," Okay, calm down. I have a small problem. ",4,5,59
Michael," Yeah, well when I call about big problems you don’t like that either, so make up you mind, kiddo. Here is the deal, the ad guys that you sent are locking me in a creative box, and sort of ignoring my ideas.",4,5,59
Michael," Well actually I can’t cook, and I am starting a restaurant. Mike’s Cereal Shack. I’m thinking we’ll have as many varieties as you can buy in the store.",4,5,59
Michael," Are you? I don’t think you’re doing such a good job here, suppressing ideas and creativity.  				",4,5,59
Michael," All right, let me ask you this, tell me if you think this is creative. When I was five, I imagined that there was such a thing as a unicorn. And this is before I had even heard of one, or seen one. I just drew a picture of a horse that could fly over rainbows, and had a huge spike in its head. And I was five, five years old. Couldn’t even talk yet.  				",4,5,59
Michael," Hey guys, um, you know what, we cannot shoot this ad today.",4,5,59
Michael," Yeah, I’m glad you called. Ryan is being a little bitch again.",4,5,59
Michael," What’s up my brotha? Listen, David, I would like to do this ad in house. I want to use only the creativity that we have right here in the office. And I will send it to you tomorrow morning, take a look at it, and if you do not think that it’s ready to air, send the ad agency back down here, and we’ll do it on my dime.",4,5,59
Michael, I’m willing to stake my entire reputation on it.,4,5,59
Michael," Okay. [hangs up phone] And thus, Michael Scott sealed his own destiny. In a good way.   				",4,5,59
Michael," Has anyone ever come up to you and said, “You’re not creative”?",4,5,59
Michael," Well they’re wrong. You are creative. You are damn creative. Each and every one of you. You are so much more creative than all of the other dry, boring morons that you work with. ",4,5,59
Michael," We have three scenes to film, big scenes. We have a song to write. So let’s get cracking. Kelly, I want you to do makeup. Oscar, I would like you to do costume design, obviously.  Phyllis, I’d like you look around town and see if we have any celebrities in our local area.  				",4,5,59
Michael," Okay, okay, Phyllis this is what I want you to do. I want you to go down to the mall. I want you to get in line. I want you to get her to be in this commercial. This would be a huge coupe people. All right? Do not take no for an answer.",4,5,59
Michael," Time out, time out, time out, time out, time out. I thought… I was under the impression that this was going to be a rap.",4,5,59
Michael," Okay, Darryl, wow, you need to learn a lot about your own culture. I’ll make you a mix. ",4,5,59
Michael, Stop. Stop stop stop stop stop stop. This is not me. This is not my music.,4,5,59
Michael," No, I hate it! I hate it! …I don’t hate it, I just don’t like it at all. And it’s terrible. ",4,5,59
Michael," Okay, you know what. Hold on, hold on Darryl.",4,5,59
Michael," No. I said I hate the, the style.  				",4,5,59
Michael," Okay, wow. Wow, this looks uh, terrible.",4,5,59
Michael," Andy, Andy, this is a pivotal scene in the ad. And if we don’t get this, if we don’t nail it, we’re going to lose the whole triumph of the moment. The triumph of the will. Now, God, what? What Phyllis?",4,5,59
Michael," Did you, or did you not get Sue Grafton? ",4,5,59
Michael," Ugh, can somebody give her a tissue please? [Kevin hands her piece of tape]  				",4,5,59
Michael, I’m about to send the ad to corporate… and it is sent. They’ll probably watch it right away. I know I would. Okay. [dials phone] ,4,5,59
Michael, They could call at any second now. [sighs] Oh God…I better call.  				,4,5,59
Michael," [Ten days later] Well, it’s been tough. The uh, geniuses at corporate rejected my commercial and tonight they are airing the brain dead version. So welcome one and all to the world premiere of Corporate Crapfest!  				",4,5,59
Michael," No, it was stupid. People like waving, waving sells. It’s not art. Yet we made our ad, the real one was full of humor, and full of depth, and full heart and it was real.   				",4,5,59
Michael," That was fun. Next round of drinks is on me, people!  				",4,5,59
Michael," This is a dummy, a la Ferris Bueller’s Day Off.  We have tied a string to the wrist, which goes to the door.  When somebody opens the door, the hand goes down, hits the remote, turns on the tape recorder, which is me snoring.  Now nobody knows whether I am here, or whether I am gone.",4,6,60
Michael," Well, sometimes.  Most of the time I will be with Ryan, or Darryl.  [knock on the door]  Yes?  Oh good, good Stanley!  First victim, this is what I want you to do.  Go out, come back in.  We’re going to hide.  I want you to tell me if this looks like me, okay?",4,6,60
Michael," Hey everyone, can I have your attention please?  I just thought you all should know that Stanley Hudson is planning on leaving us, because our old friend Karen from Utica is going to give him more money to work there.",4,6,60
Michael," No, no, no, no, no-no, no no.  You completely misinterpreted my tone, this is a horrible thing.  Clearly, Karen is trying to get back at us because Jim dumped her.",4,6,60
Michael," Okay, smarty pants, then why?  Why is she trying to take Stanley from us?",4,6,60
Michael," You cannot take the hilarious black guy from the office.  Stanley is part of what makes this branch so extraordinary.  The bluesy wisdom, the sassy remarks, the crossword puzzles, the smile, those big watery red eyes.  I don’t know how George Bush did it when Colin Powell left, and if Utica thinks that they are going to poach Stanley, they have another thing coming.  				",4,6,60
Michael," Yeah we all want money.  But there is none in the budget, so… Tell me why you’re really leaving.",4,6,60
Michael," Mo money mo problems, Stanley.  You of all people should know that.  Let me ask you this, if I were-",4,6,60
Michael," Yes, listen, um…  You cannot tear Stanley from his family like this.",4,6,60
Michael," No, his work family.  Look, this is very hard for me, but I’m going to give you my best man.  You may have Toby.",4,6,60
Michael," You can train him.  He’s very very smart, and funny, and charming… You know, I can’t do it, Toby is the worst.  That- that was a bluff, um…  Listen, if you are going to poach one of my guys, I’m going to poach one of yours.",4,6,60
Michael," Okay, good-bye.  Wait!  Wait! Karen, could you transfer me to one of your salespeople please?  Your best one?  [Karen hangs up]  				",4,6,60
Michael," I’m going to cut right to the chase here.  Do you like magic?  Because I’m a genie in a bottle, and I’m going to grant you three wishes.  To move to Scranton, to have a great job, and to be my best friend.",4,6,60
Michael," [to Pam] Get out. [to Ben] Uh, yeah.  I also saved her life, but I guess that’s not as grabby.",4,6,60
Michael," No, I fired them, and your next. … So what do you say?",4,6,60
Michael," What is that guy talking about?  Scranton is not lame.  Scranton is the cool, fun branch.  We’re like Animal House.  				",4,6,60
Michael," Jim, we’re getting crapped on.  Word is that our branch sucks, and we have to do something about it.",4,6,60
Michael," What are we going to do?  We are going to make a monster sale, that’s what we’re going to do.  Corcroan dropped Staples.",4,6,60
Michael," Yes they did, oh yes they did, and we are going to murder it.  You, me, Dwight are going to jump into my PT Cruiser, and we’re going to crush this sale.  We’re going to prove, what the hell is that music?",4,6,60
Michael,"  That’s the problem, that’s the problem.  We need rock n’ roll Pam, rock n’ roll.  Alright? [sees Toby in a bow-tie holding a plate full of tea cups] Oh… My… God, that’s why people are leaving.  I- I have no words.  				",4,6,60
Michael," What are we doing, Dwight, what we are doing?",4,6,60
Michael," We are going on a panty raid to Utica, is what we’re doing.",4,6,60
Michael, We are going to make Karen wish that she had never been dumped by you.,4,6,60
Michael," Alright, you’re going to miss the best prank ever.",4,6,60
Michael," Follow me, come here.  Here’s what we brought, we brought uniforms from the warehouse.  I brought silly string, Dwight brought gasoline and chunks of rubber to make stink bombs.",4,6,60
Michael, Teach her to offer Stanley more money.  				,4,6,60
Michael," So, why did you and Karen break up?  Was it the sex?",4,6,60
Michael," I can’t imagine the sex being bad, I mean her body is…",4,6,60
Michael," Okay, I will start.  Um, “A.” [singing] “A” my name is Alan, and my wife’s name is Alice, we live in Alaska, and we sell…  Damn it! What do we sell?  Um…",4,6,60
Michael, I’m trying to think of what we could sell.,4,6,60
Michael," Ah, la, la, la. What is that?  That sound…  The air-conditioning leaking or something?",4,6,60
Michael," Come on man, that is disgusting Dwight!",4,6,60
Michael," Yeah, Dwight, here’s how it’s going to go down.  You and I-",4,6,60
Michael, You and I are going to sneak inside and pretend that we are warehouse workers.  And then we will silly string the beejeezus out of the place.,4,6,60
Michael, [from the walkie-talkie] We are in a stairwell.,4,6,60
Michael,"  Oh my God, oh my God, that was very close.",4,6,60
Michael," We found something far better, their crown jewel.  Their industrial copier.",4,6,60
Michael," It’s enormous, but it’s got wheels.  We’re wheeling it down the hall, into the stairwell.  Get the car ready, keep the engine running.",4,6,60
Michael," We’re wedged between the copier and the railing. Ah! Ow! Ow, my leg!  Jim leave us.",4,6,60
Michael," Dwight, could you move over a little bit.",4,6,60
Michael," Take her to a motel, make love to her Jim.",4,6,60
Michael," It doesn’t have to mean anything.  Just, do it for Stanley.  Come on Jim, just climb on top of her and think about Stanley.  Ah, Jim, if this is it for me, promise me something, host the Dundies.",4,6,60
Michael," [whispers] Dwight.  Granted, maybe this was not the best idea, but at least we care enough about our employees that we are willing to fight for them.  And if you so much as harm a hair on Stanley’s head, we will burn Utica to the ground. [they get up to leave]",4,6,60
Michael," We tried and we failed.  Stanley, you may go.  Here is a box, for your things, but I doubt that that box will be able to contain all the memories that you have of this place.  Fly away sweet little bird, fly away and be free.  Pam, I’m gonna need some help writing a want ad.  				",4,6,60
Michael," [from outside] Hey, nobody cares. Nobody cares. I need that room at some point, so just, wrap it up.",4,7,61
Michael," Hypothetically, if I were to ask you to go camping, and you know what hypothetical means? [Jim makes a face] Not real.",4,7,61
Michael," So if I were to hypothetically ask you to go camping with me, would you go? ",4,7,61
Michael, How often can you actually donate blood?,4,7,61
Michael," Yeah, just this whole Toby, camping thing, uh, seems a little lame. ",4,7,61
Michael," A bunch of guys, in a tent? Making s’mores? [makes a noise and gestures with his hands]",4,7,61
Michael," Hello, I’m Broken Mountain. You know, here’s the thing. That’s not how you go camping. I think you go camping by yourself—",4,7,61
Michael," In the wilderness. It’s not with a group of guys frolicking around in tents. It’s one guy, or two guys, if your plans change.",4,7,61
Michael," I wanna do it myself. You know, I want to go and, and find out something about myself, I wanna get outta here. All the cliques, and the office politics. Fluorescent lights. Asbestos.",4,7,61
Michael, I’m sick of it Jim. I’m sick of this place.  				,4,7,61
Michael," When Jan and I had satellite, we used to watch a reality show called “Survivorman.” And, it was interesting because it was about a guy who would go out in the middle of no where and just try not to die, try not to get eaten by an animal, or be overexposed.  				",4,7,61
Michael," OK, I will only need two things. Roll of duct tape and a knife.",4,7,61
Michael," OK. Thirty minutes or less, please come back. Save the receipts. [Dwight comes back with set of knives] Hey, what… ",4,7,61
Michael," Hey, hey hey! Dwight. [Dwight rolls out an assortment knives]. Dwight.  				",4,7,61
Michael," Dwight and I are going out. He will return later, but I will not. I will also be taking a personal day tomorrow, and perhaps the next day. ",4,7,61
Michael, Dwight will be driving me deep into the Pennsylvania wilderness.,4,7,61
Michael, Where he will then leave me to either die or to survive. The choice is yours. ,4,7,61
Michael," Yes, and I am leaving you in charge of the office for the rest of the day and for the next several days. Do not try to follow me. ",4,7,61
Michael," This is a very personal, private experience in the wild, that I wish to share it with me, myself and I. ",4,7,61
Michael," When I return, I hope to be a completely changed human being.",4,7,61
Michael," This is what a true survivor man does. You simulate a disaster, like a plane wreck. You could only wear the clothes that you have on, and you could only use the stuff you have in your pockets. Now, in this case, this disaster is a serial killer. Creepy guy who’s abducted me and is taking me out into the wilderness to leave me for dead. ",4,7,61
Michael," Well, yes I would. And I would survive. ",4,7,61
Michael, You… you are as creepy as a real serial killer. For real. [blindfolds eyes with tie] OK.,4,7,61
Michael," I am putting this on so I have no familiarity with my surroundings. Now this way, I can’t retrace my steps. I don’t know what streets we’ve been— [Dwight whacks Michael with his shoe] Ow! What are you doing?",4,7,61
Michael," No! Gosh! Dwight. [Dwight tries to hit Michael with his shoe again] Stop it, stop it! Stop it.",4,7,61
Michael," Just, please allow me to have one cathartic experience in my life?  				",4,7,61
Michael, [flashback to Stanley’s birthday] Look at those wrinkles. Blacks do crack! Not crack the drug.  				,4,7,61
Michael," [flashback to Kelly’s birthday, hiding in the elevator] Happy Birthday! ",4,7,61
Michael," [flashback to Oscar’s birthday, hiding in the break room] Happy Birthday! ",4,7,61
Michael," [flashback to Phyllis’ birthday, sneaking up on Phyllis’ car] Happy Birthday!",4,7,61
Michael, Dwight will take my blindfold off when we are deep in the forest. Just the two of us from this point out. ,4,7,61
Michael," What are you doing? Stop. Dwight, Dwight. Just —",4,7,61
Michael," Alright, very good. Ahh, OK. [Dwight gives Michael a hug] ",4,7,61
Michael," Thanks for the ride. OK. Leave me be, Dwight. [Dwight runs off]  				",4,7,61
Michael," [to own camcorder] Day One. I’m in the interior of the vast Pennsylvania wilderness. I’ve brought with me only the bare essentials. A knife, roll of duct tape, in case I need to craft some shelter or make some sort of water vessel. It’s hot today. The sun is in the two-thirds easterly quadrant, which would make it about [looks at watch] 2 o’clock in the afternoon. It’s really beating down on me now. I think that I want to get a little more comfortable because the sun is depleting my resources. [cuts pants with knife] OK. OH, there we go. Watch that I don’t hit my corroded artery here…  				",4,7,61
Michael," There we go. [standing with short sleeves and short pants] Much better. Now everything I brought with me can be used. My sport coat here, can be fashioned into a backpack of sorts [ties jacket around neck].   				",4,7,61
Michael, I’m going to wear what was once one of my pant legs. [puts pant leg on head like a hat]   				,4,7,61
Michael," See, this is a beautiful piece of material [rips other pant leg in half] This could be used for all sorts of things.  				",4,7,61
Michael, Some sort of kerchief to keep my neck nice and comfortable.   				,4,7,61
Michael," I am totally alone right now, with only my thoughts. I love it. I’m loving it. I can literally say anything I want. No one is gonna here me. [screams] Wish I could have gone with Ryan on that cool retreat! Jan has plastic boobs! I HAVE HEMORRHOIDS! Doesn’t even matter.   				",4,7,61
Michael," Well it is a little chillier than I had thought, so I have fashioned my hat back into my pants. Several hours in, time for me to find some nourishment. Now, these woods are full of creatures that can sustain human life. Things like, uh, squirrels, nice juicy rabbit would be delicious.  				",4,7,61
Michael," I have made this spear, with which I will impale my dinner. And it couldn’t come a moment too soon because I have been without food for a good three hours or so. I’m startin’ to feel it a little bit. Ohh… It’s Creed’s birthday. [singing] Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to Creed. Happy Birthday to you. Happy birthday, buddy.  				",4,7,61
Michael," Well if you take a look at this, I tented my pants. I’ve made myself a nice pants tent shelter. And this little guy [pats a large tree trunk] may be Dunder Mifflin paper some day.   				",4,7,61
Michael," Under this tree, I think I struck the mother load. Those [points camera to mushrooms] are nature’s best mushrooms. Wild, and I have to say these little buggers are damn tasty as well. [puts them in mouth] ",4,7,61
Michael," Yeah! [everybody clapping] Alright, skip around the room. Skip around the room. We want — OK, alright. Yeah, don’t do that. You’re gonna break something.  				",4,7,61
Michael," Man became civilized for a reason. He decided that he liked to have warmth, and clothing, and television, and hamburgers, and to walk upright, and to have a soft futon at the end of the day. He didn’t want to have to struggle to survive. I don’t need the woods. I have a nice wood desk. I don’t need fresh  air, because I have the freshest air around, A.C. And I don’t need wide open spaces. Check it out. [shows off computer screen scenery] I can also make it the sky.  				",4,7,61
Michael," Yeah, okay, I did that. Rookie mistake. ",4,7,61
Michael," Uh huh. Yeah, just wait. Ten years, you’ll figure it out.",4,7,61
Michael, That’s what I said. That’s what she said.,4,7,61
Michael," I never know. I just say it. I say stuff like that, you know, to lighten the tension. When things sort of get hard.",4,7,61
Michael," Hey! Nice. Really good. Bravo, my young ward.  				",4,7,61
Michael,"  This summer, corporate is sponsoring a little weight loss contest between the branches. Whichever branch loses the most weight gets three extra vacation days.  				",5,1,63
Michael,  OK everybody. Get used to this because we are going to be standing here briefly every Monday for the next seven Mondays.,5,1,63
Michael,"  Oh, Pamcake. No, no, no. We would love your extra poundage, but you are going to be leaving us next week, so vamoose. Vamoose, Pam. Dunder Mifflin family only.",5,1,63
Michael,  I learned that she broke her left leg twice in one year. I learned that she’s allergic to sesame seeds. I learned that she has read “Lonesome Dove” three times.,5,1,63
Michael,  [follows Jim into bathroom] You have to agree with me. [follows Jim back out] That’s insane.,5,1,63
Michael,"  [sees Pam and Jim through office window, runs out the office] Hey, hey! [falls down stairs, gets up, falls down again] Pam, Pam! Hey!",5,1,63
Michael,  [frazzled and out of breath] I wrote you a goodbye poem. It’s really long. I left it up in my office. Could you just please wait till I go get it?,5,1,63
Michael,"  No. OK. Um, the last word is “seagulls.”",5,1,63
Michael,"  All right, call– [leans in to kiss Pam]",5,1,63
Michael,"  OK, no, no, no, no, no, no. Same places as last week.",5,1,63
Michael," Yes, it does. No, this is about weight displacement. We have to have the same weight distribution. Right here. Here we go. Let’s move that up. Here we go.",5,1,63
Michael,"  [rapping] I’m MC Mike Scott, and I am hot. She’s DJ Jazzy Flax, and she is the best. All those sucker branches can suck our fat!",5,1,63
Michael,"  Hi, Jan. Hello, baby. How are you? Good to see you. Who’s your daddy? You don’t know who your daddy is, do you? No, you don’t. [to Jan] Come on. Let’s go in.  				",5,1,63
Michael,"  No way. No way. Pam Beesley. Hello. [picks up computer] Hey, everybody look, Pam. Pam, say hi. Say hi to Pam. Don’t we all look skinny? Oh, oh, almost dropped you!",5,1,63
Michael,"  Pam, I’d like you to meet Ronnie. We call her Rice-a-Ronnie. She is hilarious. She is wonderful, a beam of light in this dark, dark office. Not really so much. All she does is plop herself down there and answer phones all day.",5,1,63
Michael,"  Oh, calm down, weirdo. It’s just a joke. She’s such a weirdo! You know what? My real beef with her, though, Pam? She can’t find those little colored paper clips that I like so much. Will you help her find them, please?",5,1,63
Michael,  Let’s go. We are following Pam to the supply shelf. Let us go.  				,5,1,63
Michael,"  OK, everybody, let’s suck in our guts.",5,1,63
Michael,  Cake? Who suggested cake? [Angela points to Phyllis],5,1,63
Michael,"  Are you kidding me? We only lost one pound, Phyllis.  				",5,1,63
Michael,  What is wrong with these people? They have no willpower. I went — I once went 28 years without having sex. And then again for seven years.  				,5,1,63
Michael,  Does anyone have any idea what the number one cause of death is in this country?,5,1,63
Michael,"  Thank you. Holly is right. People, this is not just about winning some extra vacation days. This is about a very cool HR initiative that if we don’t follow, we are all going to die of obesity. So how much are we gonna lose?",5,1,63
Michael,"  Yes, all right. Who else? [to Angela] Can I put you down for 10 pounds?",5,1,63
Michael,"  If you gain weight, you will die. I want you to live forever. I want us all to live forever. How? How are we going to do this?",5,1,63
Michael,  This is how we’re gonna do it. Five pounds. I’m asking each of you to lose five pounds. That plus Jim’s 65 will give us a very good chance at winning this thing.  				,5,1,63
Michael,"  Wait a second. [removes condom from wallet, throws it to Jim] I don’t want you to end up with a surprise pregnancy like me.",5,1,63
Michael,  [music playing] It’s a pretty lame party.,5,1,63
Michael,  You know what we should do? We should have a party and not invite them.,5,1,63
Michael,"  Um, I think you’ll have fun. Men from Scranton are handsome, and they know how to show a woman a good time.",5,1,63
Michael,  You know what? We’re pretty much done here today. Why don’t you just take off early?,5,1,63
Michael,"  Oh, Holly doesn’t need luck. Everyone that meets her instantly loves her.  				",5,1,63
Michael,"  OK, everybody. Phyllis, did I or did I not say fruit?",5,1,63
Michael,"  You know, we’re gonna have to try a little harder if we are going to win this thing.",5,1,63
Michael,"  Ronnie was bleh.  Things were at an all time sad here.  But then I got an e-mail from Ryan, that he was coming back to town.  And I called the temp agency and I told them I will pay you any amount, just give me Ryan Howard.  Give him to me.  I want him.  I need him.  				",5,1,63
Michael,"  Hey, you know what?  I can’t do this by myself people!  Kelly and I are the only ones who have either passed out or almost passed out. [flails his arms]",5,1,63
Michael,   [struggling to speak] Mmm— mmm…  Um…  				,5,1,63
Michael,  Close the door.  This is your fault.  ,5,1,63
Michael,"  I should have been lovers with her first and then friends.  That was terrible advice.  Terrible advice!  You know my seduction method.  I like to get in there and get my hands dirty! Wh—  You sabotaged me.  You sabotaged me, man!  				",5,1,63
Michael,"  Gah, the dreadmill. [both laugh]  				",5,1,63
Michael,"  [in a fat suit, speaking in his Michael Clump voice] Ohhhh!  Bang!  Boom!  Say Clump! Why hello everybody!",5,1,63
Michael,"  I say, I say, I say, I say down Holly! I’ll take it from here. I am beautiful. [hangs pictures of fat people on the wall, including two fat people on a bike, the Ghostbusters Marshmallow Man, Elvis, Martin Lawrence in Big Mamma’s House, Jabba the Hutt, and a fat pig] They are beautiful. He is beautiful.  This big fat pig is beautiful.  				",5,1,63
Michael,  It’s my sumo suit.  I just didn’t inflate it all the way.  I am so glad that I bought instead of rented.  				,5,1,63
Michael,  Body image.  We are here because there is something wrong with society.,5,1,63
Michael,"  If it’s me, then society made me that way.  Now, I know a lot of you are probably asking yourself, “Why are you dressed in a plus sized suit?”",5,1,63
Michael,  How dare you! Michael Clump is a celebration of fat people.,5,1,63
Michael,"  No, no, no, NO, no!  You know what?  Fat people are not monsters!  Why don’t you guys have a little more sensitivity to the subject.  Bang!  Boom!  Case in point!  Look at the outside of this building.  It is ugly.  But you come inside… and it is beautiful.  Just like this unappealing fat suit.  Inside is a rather handsome, sexy, man.",5,1,63
Michael,"  Hey!  Why don’t you just sit down, please?",5,1,63
Michael,  We’re doing this because of you.  So why don’t you just go stand somewhere else.  [to Ryan] Hey.  Hey.  You shaved?,5,1,63
Michael,"  Dwight, I would like you to apologize to this beautiful, beautiful woman for forcing her to walk five miles, which for her is basically a death march.",5,1,63
Michael,"  You’re right, you’re right.  Just, Dwight, do it.  Just say it ok.",5,1,63
Michael,"  Finally.  Right?  Ok, Phyllis you must be exhausted from standing on those gams.  Why don’t you have a seat?  [Phyllis sits] Let’s all clap at Phyllis. [everyone claps] Ok!  [in Michael Clump voice]  When Michael Clump wants to remind you [normal voice] that corporate… their idea, yes, was to urge you to lose weight, but more importantly what this whole thing is about, this contest is really about being healthy.  And in order to be healthy, you have to eat, Kelly.  Kelly.  [kneels down in front of Kelly, Dwight tries to help him down, Michael shouts gibberish at him]  Kelly, I want you to stand up on your chair.  Come on, stand up on your chair.  Stand up, stand up, stand up.  Somebody help her.  Here we go. [Kelly stands up on her chair] Ok, I want you to look at her.  She’s a beautiful Indian woman.  Why?  What makes her beautiful?",5,1,63
Michael,"  Kelly, will you just agree to stop this mess and stop trying to kill yourself?",5,1,63
Michael,"  I want you to know.  Kelly, look at me!   I want you to know that you are beautiful.  You are truly, truly beautiful.  Give me a hug.  [Michael hugs Kelly, his head in her chest] Mmmmmm.  				",5,1,63
Michael,"  Hey Ryan, look.  Shaved off my goatee.  I am goateeless.  We are the goateeless brothers. ",5,1,63
Michael,"  Ahaha, Yep! [Dwight looks down depressingly and rubs his new goatee]",5,1,63
Michael,"   Oscar, enough with the girl talk please.",5,1,63
Michael,"  No no, did, I heard you talking to Oscar about that guy.  What, what happened?  Did he call?",5,1,63
Michael,"  I dunno.  I always call everybody back right away.  He’ll call back though.  Give him until the end of the day, he’ll call.  If he doesn’t, he is loco.",5,1,63
Michael,"  Wait, do we have until the end of the day?  				",5,1,63
Michael,"  [Kelly eating in the break room] Hey, is that healthy food?",5,1,63
Michael,"  We’re trying to win a contest here, Kelly.  Please?",5,1,63
Michael,"  Ok, that is fine.  Just water, and be back by weigh-in, ok?",5,1,63
Michael,"  I have to say, I think the problem with that whole thing…",5,1,63
Michael,  …was that he was a complete stupid idiot.,5,1,63
Michael,  That’s a shame.  A shame to waste these.  I want to buy them from you.,5,1,63
Michael,"  I do.  No.  I do.  I, I want to.  Trust me.  I really do.",5,1,63
Michael,"  Alright.  Alright!  [tears up tickets]  Just, I want you to just forget about him, ok?  Case closed.  Umm, can I pay you tomorrow?  I have like a 60 dollar limit on my ATM, so…",5,1,63
Michael,"  Nonono, no, no, I don’t want to hear moaning.  This is a good day.  You guys accomplished something big.  You lost a ton of weight, literally.  A lot of weight.  And I don’t care what any stupid scale says.  You guys are all gigantic losers.  				",5,1,63
Michael, “Why are you helping her?  You’re not even dating.”  She’s my friend… and… ultimately my strategy is to merge this into a relationship… without her even knowing. Uh…  				,5,2,64
Michael," Ok, let’s give it for Miss… Holly Flaaaax! [everyone claps]",5,2,64
Michael," [clapping] Ok.  Well done.  Good speech Ryan, you’re a good guy.",5,2,64
Michael," Well, I think we can all totally agree that Holly is totally fantastic. [claps]",5,2,64
Michael, Can we have a moment?  [whispering] Can I talk to you for a sec?  Lot of good stuff. And you look… you look fantastic.,5,2,64
Michael," Do some… do some work. [whispering to Holly] People expect a lot from these meetings.  Laughter, sudden twists.  Surprise endings.  You need to be Robin Williams and M. Night Shyamalan.  You need to be Robin Shyamalan.",5,2,64
Michael, Do you… just… you’re kind of losing them.,5,2,64
Michael," [coughs to hide his words] Lauren, [coughs] enough with the pencils.",5,2,64
Michael, I would not… steal the bread.  And I would not let my family go hungry.,5,2,64
Michael," Anybody?  This is a chance for you to say something without any repercussions.  Stanley?  Oscar, come on.",5,2,64
Michael, To tell you or not.  And I’m glad I did.  I feel very very good.  Cathartic.  I promise you that you are not going to get into trouble.  You can say anything you want with total and complete immunity.,5,2,64
Michael," Yeah, [interrupting gibberish].  Come on, anybody.  Let it fly.",5,2,64
Michael, You are a thief of joy.  Anybody else.  Yeah?,5,2,64
Michael," That’s crazy.  That’s crazy talk!  Meredith!  The Merenator, sleepin’ with suppliers!  Hoo-ooh!  Wow!  What time we got? [checks watch] You know what?  That’s a good place to end it.  Right there.  This, I think, was a great ethics seminar.  She has given us a lot of wonderful things to think about.  Right… what is wrong.  Who’s to say?  Really.  In the end.  I mean because it is… unknowable.  But, let’s give her a round of applause.  Holly, everybody.  Holly!  Get back to work. [everyone applauds, then leaves] [to Holly] Great job.  I am truly impressed.  That, uh, you really pulled that one out.  Classic.  Classic meeting.  We should celebrate.",5,2,64
Michael," Meredith, why don’t you tell Holly… it’s not what she thinks.  Nothing unethical happened… and that you just like to sleep around.",5,2,64
Michael," No… no, this is just a stupid formality.",5,2,64
Michael," Well, well.  Holly… lujah!  It’s a miracle, you’re at your desk.",5,2,64
Michael," Hoo-ooh!  Reaching!  You’ll get there.  Anyway, I was giving it some thought, and there’s no reason that two attractive, good looking, intelligent, funny, attractive people can’t, you know, just… sit down and work this whole Meredith thing out. ",5,2,64
Michael, Good.  Would you care to bang it out over lunch?,5,2,64
Michael," Oh no, no, no.  Your food is no good here, my lady.  [sweeps her food into the trash can, misses]  Sorry!  You know what?  Let’s go out!  Dunder Mifflin’s treat.  Um, actually you’re not a client… so… we’ll just split it?  Ethical.  				",5,2,64
Michael, What do you think?  What do you think of this place?,5,2,64
Michael," Istn’t it?  Yeah, it’s kind of… business/romantic.  So you’re from Des Moines?",5,2,64
Michael, Here too.  You know what my favorite season is?,5,2,64
Michael," Yeah, get the boring stuff out of the way.  Autumn was what I was going to say.  When the leaves change.  It’s just, I… I think it is the most contemplative of seasons.",5,2,64
Michael," I just don’t want my employees thinking that their jobs depend on performance.  I mean, what sort of place is that to call home?  And Meredith needs this job.  This is her main source of money.",5,2,64
Michael," Ok, new idea.  We don’t report it at all.  We just punish her.",5,2,64
Michael," Mmhmm, tell her she can’t have sex for six months.",5,2,64
Michael," I don’t know.  I saw this thing, like a belt with a key.",5,2,64
Michael," No, it’s more of a underwear garment that has little spikes like made of, sometimes they are made of metal.  You know what I am talking about.  You unlock a little door that… down… where you, where you put, where you put the…  				",5,2,64
Michael, I am just saying that I don’t think that you understand what I am saying.,5,2,64
Michael," Well, you have to tolerate a lot when you are part of a family.",5,2,64
Michael, I will be honest with you.  That car ride did not go well and that was not my fault.  The only reason I am standing out here right now is because I don’t want to take the elevator with her.  And I am holding on to her leftovers. [throws Holly’s leftovers in the trash]  				,5,2,64
Michael, What’s the only thing worse than one HR rep?,5,2,64
Michael," I don’t know.  Can you?  Kendall, my main man.",5,2,64
Michael, Let the record show that it was during the immunity part of the seminar.,5,2,64
Michael," How do you tell somebody that you care about deeply, “I told you so.”  Gently with a rose?  In a funny way, like it’s a hilarious joke?  Or do you just let it go, because saying it would just make things worse? … Probably the funny way.  				",5,2,64
Michael," Ok, everybody listen up.  If you are not in that conference room in two minutes I am going to kill you.",5,2,64
Michael, Get in there right now or I’m gonna lose it! [everyone gets up to go in the conference room],5,2,64
Michael," Now is really not the time, Meredith.  				",5,2,64
Michael, I get a call from Jan and I meet her at the hospital.,5,3,65
Michael," I checked the route – there are no potholes.  Come on, get in here and have the baby.",5,3,65
Michael," [annoyed] Andy, would you like to have my baby?",5,3,65
Michael," All right, OK. [to Andy] Sorry.  Sorry.  Here we go.  Here we go!",5,3,65
Michael," Do it! Do it!  Scream!  Scream it out, scream it out, scream it out.",5,3,65
Michael, [annoyed] All right.  Dwight.  Just push and breathe.,5,3,65
Michael," Shhh. No, you can’t have it.  It’s too late.",5,3,65
Michael, Aaaaaaaa!  It’s coming!  Here we go! [drops the watermelon onto the floor] Oh! God! Wow! What was on that?,5,3,65
Michael, Nice touch.  Good.  Let’s try that again.  				,5,3,65
Michael, [eating the watermelon] It is going to be the happiest day of my life. [Dwight gets dressed behind Michael and zips his fly]  				,5,3,65
Michael," Hello ladies, how’s my shower going?  Phyllis, did you get the live storks?",5,3,65
Michael," Damnit, Phyllis!  I’m sorry.  [more softly] Damnit, Phyllis.  It was hard enough to convince Jan to come.  So are we set for refreshments?",5,3,65
Michael, She said it is the name of a Viking princess. So…,5,3,65
Michael," I know.  I know.  It is beautiful.  No.  Thank you.  Is this it? I mean, is this… Two bowls of M&Ms and some balloons?  You know what Phyllis, I think you need to step it up.  I think you need to get the lead out.  Because if I’m not mistaken, we gave you your wedding shower here.  We all came into this room and gave you a golden shower.  Well you know what, where’s my golden shower, Phyllis?  				",5,3,65
Michael," It does not matter to me at all whether this baby is biologically mine.  I am going to love it. It’s like when the dog nurses the tiger cub.  Have you seen that video?  It is… it’s so bizarre and unnatural, but… it, it happens.  				",5,3,65
Michael," [banging on the glass] Hey, hey.  What are you doing?  Don’t talk to them.",5,3,65
Michael," Make the party.  Don’t – make the party, please, Phyllis. [Phyllis starts inflating a balloon with a pump] Pump it!  				",5,3,65
Michael," Um, listen.  Jan Levinson is coming in today, and she is in the terminal stages of her pregnancy – the child of which I have a vested interest.  It’s all kind of weird.  Anyway, she is incredibly… fat and enormous right now – extremely unattractive.  And you are, on the other hand, one of the more attractive people in the office.  So, while she’s here I am going to be acting kind of cold to you.  And I am doing this to pay respect to her bloated feelings.  And I’m treating Ryan the same way.",5,3,65
Michael," Oh, man. Him? That guy? He had no sense of humor and I proved him wrong in so many ways.",5,3,65
Michael," [cradling the car seat awkwardly] All right, OK.  				",5,3,65
Michael," I love babies. I think they are beautiful in all sorts of different ways.  I try to pick up and hold a baby every day, if possible, because it nourishes me.  It feeds my soul.  Babies are drawn to me, and I think it’s because they see me as one of them.  But cooler, and with my life put together a little bit.  If a baby were president, there would be no taxes, there would be no war.  There would be no government, and things could get terrible.  It actually, probably – it would be a better screenplay idea than a serious suggestion.  				",5,3,65
Michael," [carrying the car seat] Ladies and gentlemen, it is my privilege and honor to present for the first time in her life and in the office:",5,3,65
Michael," …trid Levinson.  Hi!  Astrid, this is everybody, look.  This is your family.  You’re going to know them for the rest of your life.  ",5,3,65
Michael," [looking at Creed] Well, he may not be here. Say hello!  OK, here we go. [lifting the car seat high above his head] Lion King!",5,3,65
Michael," OK, come on, let’s get our shower on. Conference room, choppity chip chop.",5,3,65
Michael," [sees Jan sizing up Holly] I’m fine, weirdo.  Such an HR weirdo.  Try not to suck all the air out of there when you walk in.  				",5,3,65
Michael," No, the baby doesn’t ruin anything, Kevin, OK?  The baby multiplies the fun.  Let’s just do what you were going to do.",5,3,65
Michael," All right, how about some presents?  I want to see some presents. [holding a memo pad] I got this so I can write down for thank-you notes.",5,3,65
Michael," Hey! Hey, no no no no no no no no. No.  No.  This is the birth story. It was beautiful. It was beautiful.  This is a once-in-a-lifetime experience.  And I should have been there. I should have been there to witness this.  				",5,3,65
Michael," [voiceover] I usually love babies, but when I held Astrid I just felt… shortchanged.",5,3,65
Michael," Uh, I need some advice from one baby daddy to another.",5,3,65
Michael," Yeah, I a baby daddy.  Um, when you first became a baby daddy, did you have an immediate connection with that baby?  Like, the first time that you held it, did you find that with your baby baby?",5,3,65
Michael," Why, Darryl, because I’m quote white quote unquote?",5,3,65
Michael," [sees Holly behind Jan] I was just going to…  I was going to talk to Holly, about her hygiene.  She smells like old tomatoes and dirt.",5,3,65
Michael," All right.  All right, everybody, we’re leaving.  Jan and Astrid are leaving.",5,3,65
Michael," Wha – that’s, I hate her.  Wha – God!  Why would you even ask me to – I, I mean, not that it matters, ’cause I don’t, but wha – OK, all right, fine.",5,3,65
Michael," [just hugs her, and she hugs him back and smiles] You wanna go out?",5,3,65
Michael," I didn’t feel much when I held Astrid, but I got a good feeling from Holly.  				",5,3,65
Michael, I’m actually thinking about getting my own set of putt-putt golf clubs.,5,4,66
Michael," Okay. Oh, wait, oh, tonight’s no good. [Holly’s smile quickly fades] Because I am busy taking you out.",5,4,66
Michael," Wow… Oh, wait a second, I can’t tonight…",5,4,66
Michael," Too many times. It’s all good, um, alright, so, good, so, have a nice day.",5,4,66
Michael," In my opinion, the third date is traditionally the one where… you have sex. Does Holly feel that way? I don’t know. I will probably find out tonight. If she starts having sex with me I’ll know for sure.  				",5,4,66
Michael," Some of what we order depends on whether we’re having sex after. [laughs] Oh, my. Wow, elephant in the room. Are we, do you think? Do you think we’re going to have sex tonight?",5,4,66
Michael," Okay, so, we do the restaurant thing and then… then… then we can do… We’ll just do the restaurant thing first.",5,4,66
Michael, Probably get soup or something light.   				,5,4,66
Michael," No. No. Reservations are at 8:00, so we’ve got like an hour and 45 minutes. [sighs] [goofy voice] I’m a crazy eight, I’m crazy.",5,4,66
Michael, Thank vous. [chuckling] What? Oh! [kissing],5,4,66
Michael, Not if we turn these dials [getting louder] all the way down. [whispering] Now they can’t hear us at all.,5,4,66
Michael, So much for sex without consequences.  				,5,4,66
Michael," We’re gonna make everything all right. Alright? Conference room, 15 minutes. Half an hour. Alright?  				",5,4,66
Michael," To recoup their losses, I am planning a little charity auction, where people from all over Scranton can come and bid on our goods and services. I’m calling it crime-aid. It’s like farm aid, but instead of farms fighting against AIDS, it is us fighting against our own poverty.  				",5,4,66
Michael," Okay, I’m gonna have to stop you right there. Was this a sorority that you didn’t get into a real sorority so you had to kind of form your own?",5,4,66
Michael," Okay. Okay! Well, come on, let’s have an auction. Let’s do this. We’ll auction off people like in the olden days.",5,4,66
Michael," I don’t know, it could be any number of people. It could be a pedestrian. It could be an old person. It could be a lookie-loo. Or, it could be… a Bruce Springsteen fan – what? Who said that? I did. Why did I say that? Oh, I think you know why I said that. I think it is very apparent. I think it goes without saying. Bear with me. There’s a point there. But what is the point? I don’t understand what he’s saying. It seems a little shady. It seems a little foggy. Well, it’s not a little foggy there’s actually something going on here-",5,4,66
Michael," Pump it up! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! [Huey Lewis’ Heart of Rock and Roll plays] Pump up the volume. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you, Mr. Springsteen. [music stops] And welcome to C.R.I.M.E.-A.I.D. [clears throat] Crime Reduces Innocence Makes Everyone Angry I Declare. It is not known how many office robberies occur every second because there is no  Wikipedia entry for office robbery statistics. However, tonight, its victims, are standing together and standing strong in the form of song, cooking lessons, and hugs. Really Phyllis? You’re auctioning a hug? Okay, so with no further ado, lights, camera, auction! Take it away Bruce! [Huey Lewis’ Heart of Rock and Roll plays]  				",5,4,66
Michael," Okay, this is the moment that you have all been waiting for. Our first item up for bids tonight is something that I consider to be very boss indeed. [cheers and applause] It is a Yoga lesson from Holly Flax! Yoga! And I would like to start the bidding off at 300 dollars. [auctioneer voice] 300 dollars do I hear 300 dollars? 300 dollars. Hey, batter batter batter, hey batter, swing batter, 300 dollars, 300 dollars, 300 dollars. Anybody, 300 dollars. 400 dollars. Who wants for 400-[speaking gibberish] Do I see somebody in the back? Is there somebody in the back? Do I see somebody in the back? 400-450 [speaking gibberish] Sold! For 300 dollars to me! [bangs gavel, which squeaks] What the hell is that?",5,4,66
Michael," It squeaks when you bang it, that’s what she said. Let’s hear it for me! Right? A bargain at any price!",5,4,66
Michael," Oh, yes, great. Very good, Um, so, Darryl, and the boys in the hood in the warehouse, have graciously donated to, uh, go out for a beer with them right now. You know what, I’m actually going to bid on this. I’m going to start the bidding, because this is something that I have dreamt of-",5,4,66
Michael," Okay. Okay, sold! Have fun, you guys. Well, this next item is sure to spring steam from your ears if you don’t win it. It just says “Creed.”",5,4,66
Michael," Let’s hear an opening bid, everybody. Who’s first? Kevin do your taxes. He’s the tax man. Kevin the tax man.",5,4,66
Michael," Okay, alright. Hey, you know what? I would appreciate it if people would stop storming off the stage.  				",5,4,66
Michael," We are getting there folks. Slow and steady. [David Wallace walks in] Well, well, have we been blessed today. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. David Wallace! Whoo!",5,4,66
Michael, Keep it going. Hey batter batter batter.,5,4,66
Michael," All right, all right, all right, all right, all right! Here we go. All right, big ticket item. [cheering] All right, in my pocket, I have… two tickets… to Mr. Bruce Springsteen, front… Oh, where are those? Has anyone seen an envelope with Bruce Springsteen front row tickets and backstage passes? Anybody seen something like-lying around? ",5,4,66
Michael," No. I think they were stolen. I think they were stolen and they’re gone forever. So… oh, that was the last good item. So, good job, everybody.",5,4,66
Michael," Yeah, well, Phyllis, nobody… really wants a hug, so.",5,4,66
Michael," 300, we have 300. 300 going once. 300 going twice.",5,4,66
Michael," 1,000 going once, 1,000 going twice. Sold for 1,000 dollar. [applause] Nicely done.  				",5,4,66
Michael," [whispering] Hey, that looks good. Listen, about the tickets. It’s sort of a gray-kind of a gray area in terms of…whether or not I had them- [Holly covers Michaels mouth]  				",5,4,66
Michael," Okay, I think we are set. We have puzzles, string for Cat’s Cradles. Burned this last night. A little road trip CD. Puppets. ",5,5,67
Michael," When Corporate found out that we were dating, they decided they were going to transfer Holly back to her old branch, in Nashua, New Hampshire.   				",5,5,67
Michael," Oh, copy that breaker. Those Duke boys are at it again.",5,5,67
Michael," All right everybody. I’m out of here. Jim, you’re in charge.",5,5,67
Michael, You can let people go a couple of minutes early if you want. ,5,5,67
Michael," We’re gonna switch back and forth, the driving. Sometimes we’ll just meet in the middle. It’ll be fun. Wait a sec. Oh I love this song.",5,5,67
Michael, Ah! Ah! Ahhhh!  [waking up] Hey. Whew. Ow. I was having a nightmare.,5,5,67
Michael, Was I?  Really? Was I saying anything interesting?,5,5,67
Michael," Halfway! Okay, You know what I want to do, I want to pull over and find little bed and breakfast for when we meet in the middle. Emphasis on the bed. And the breakfast.",5,5,67
Michael," Yeah. I don’t know I just- I imagined a hotel right here. Pool, over here. Really good breakfast place. With really good bacon.  				",5,5,67
Michael," Here we go, fourth time’s a charm. “Life’s like a road where you just… one day here, and the next day back…Sometimes you deal with it, today you don’t, sometimes you do, what you want… there’s a world out there…. [Holly sobs] Hey. Are you crying?",5,5,67
Michael," Oh no no no.. It’s gonna work, it’ll be fine.",5,5,67
Michael, Not last – no. In like the last ten years.,5,5,67
Michael," I’ve dated almost four women, and you are so far above them, it is stupid.",5,5,67
Michael," Holly thinks that this relationship is over. Well, you know what? I am not gonna give up that easy. I’m gonna make this way harder than it needs to be.  				",5,5,67
Michael," Okay, okay. I will talk to you on the Bluetooth the entire trip. So we’re talking constantly all the way. ",5,5,67
Michael," I’ll tell you everything that I see. Everything that I pass by, things that I witness on the road.",5,5,67
Michael, Maybe I’ll see an accident one weekend?,5,5,67
Michael," Here’s my wish. I want you to meet a great guy, and I want you to be happy.",5,5,67
Michael," My wish has come true, incidentally, because, you’ve met me, and you are happy.",5,5,67
Michael," You know what? I think we’re a great couple. I think we’re a classic couple. I think we’re like Romeo and Juliet. I think we… go together so well.  We’re like peanut butter and jelly, don’t you think?",5,5,67
Michael, Then don’t do it. Please don’t do this. Please don’t do this. [they continue arguing],5,5,67
Michael," No I won’t! I’m not strong! And I’ll go back to Jan, and I hate Jan! Oh God!  				",5,5,67
Michael," Oh that’s mine actually. Um, maybe put it back in the truck.",5,5,67
Michael," You know I have some things I need to do this weekend. I just remembered, so, I’ll just ride back with you.",5,5,67
Michael, I’ll be down in just a second. [into house] Holly?  				,5,5,67
Michael, So um… I think I’m gonna go back with Darryl [Holly hugs Michael] Okay. [they kiss goodbye.] Goodbye.,5,5,67
Michael," No, we would never do that. And if we did, it would be with Jim and Pam.",5,6,68
Michael, I don’t want to do that. [chanting continues] All right. [picks up phone and dials] She is going to freak out!,5,6,68
Michael," Why do you always do that? Whenever I’m getting married, you don’t believe me.",5,6,68
Michael," I’m not, I’m not getting married. So… [laughs] Psych.  ",5,6,68
Michael, And I’m out a fiancee. Are those the customer surveys?,5,6,68
Michael, I’ll take care of that for you. [crumples receipt and throws it in trash] Thanks.  ,5,6,68
Michael," Kelly Kapoor is our dusky, exotic customer service rep. And once a year, she will contact our clients and find out how happy they are with our salespeople. Sort of a Kapoor’s List. “Schindler’s List” parody. … That’s not appropriate, no.  ",5,6,68
Michael," Alrighty, Dwighty, let’s see how you did.",5,6,68
Michael, A number of your clients found your personal style abrasive and distasteful.,5,6,68
Michael," If I were joking, you would be laughing. Do you look like you are laughing?",5,6,68
Michael," Jim, they are a poopy. [Jim coughs, presses button to end call on Bluetooth]  ",5,6,68
Michael," No. [glances at it] Yes, I am sure, Jim. It —",5,6,68
Michael, So let’s see what we can find out from reading. [reads] Jim Halpert is smudge and arrogant.,5,6,68
Michael," Here’s what’s going to happen. I am going to have to fix you, manage you two on a more personal scale, a more micro form of management. Jim, what is that called?",5,6,68
Michael," Boom! Yes. Now, Jim is going to be the client. Dwight, you’re going to have to sell to him without being aggressive, hostile or difficult. Let’s go.",5,6,68
Michael, He’s hard of — he’s an old man. Let’s go.,5,6,68
Michael, That is totally inappropriate. You never yell at the client. You never yell at the client.,5,6,68
Michael," Hello, this is Michael Scott, regional manager.",5,6,68
Michael," Hello, Mr. Buttlicker. How may we help you?",5,6,68
Michael," [covers phone, whispers to Dwight] See how it’s done? [into phone] Thank you very much, sir. I don’t think you’ll regret it. [to Dwight] See what I did?",5,6,68
Michael, … [whispers] It’s a million-dollar sale.  ,5,6,68
Michael, Dwight. [to Kelly] I was informed by these gentlemen that the reports that you filed may not entirely be accurate.,5,6,68
Michael," [looks momentarily flattered, but thinks better of it] Kelly.",5,6,68
Michael," You cannot say “I was raped” and expect all of your problems to go away, Kelly. Not again. Don’t keep doing that. I’ll give you one last chance to come clean. Just tell me what happened.",5,6,68
Michael," Don’t. Don’t. Get away from that, Dwight, please. You know what? She’s got a point about you two. You do have a problem dealing with people.",5,6,68
Michael, I will call you when it is time. [Jim and Dwight leave],5,6,68
Michael," I have an enormous amount of trouble trying to get people to come to my place. And I hate it. I can’t tell you how much leftover guacamole I have ended up eating over the years. I don’t even know why I make it in such great quantities. Here’s what we’re gonna do. We are going to sit here for a while, make it look good. And maybe you should cry. Can you make yourself cry?",5,6,68
Michael," I think you should do that. [Kelly starts fake-crying, then laughing, then she and Michael both laugh]  ",5,6,68
Michael, I am jetting off on an international business trip.,5,7,69
Michael," My boss is sending me abroad to do a presentation to an international client and I have always been intrigued by all things international.  The women, the pancakes, the man of mystery…  				",5,7,69
Michael," Meredith, I would like you to pretend that you are from Abu Dhabi.",5,7,69
Michael, I am ashamed at your naked face. I must cover it with my jacket. [covers Meredith’s face with his jacket] You are now sexy in your culture.  				,5,7,69
Michael, I have my passport. [pats jacket pocket],5,7,69
Michael,  I have my per diem. [holds up money] I already know what I am going to spend this on.  I am going to buy a sweater.,5,7,69
Michael, Well I’ll just… I’ll use different money for that.   				,5,7,69
Michael," And business class air, like a five-star hotel in the sky, nothing but the best.  Actually better than a five-star hotel ’cause you get a big, cushy seat and you sit in a row of people and to eat, whatever the mind can imagine.  I think I am going to have a filet with mushroom sauce.",5,7,69
Michael, I do. It’s right here. [indicates to waist],5,7,69
Michael, Yeah baby! That’s what I’m talking about. That could be you [points at Jim] if you hadn’t forgotten French.  Where is my numbers man?,5,7,69
Michael, [on airplane] Welcome to Cribs-the business class edition. Check this out. Mimosa.,5,7,69
Michael, Handed to me as I sat down.  This was my hot towel.  It is still wet.,5,7,69
Michael, Take a sip of that. [hands Andy his mimosa],5,7,69
Michael, Don’t drink all of it.  Give some to Oscar.,5,7,69
Michael, You want one of your own? I can hook you up.,5,7,69
Michael," Yes, this is Beth.  This is my personal valet/flight attendant and she will be helping me this morning.",5,7,69
Michael," Get back, get back.  Come on, get back to the slums.",5,7,69
Michael," [whisper] Hey… guys, check it out.  My own personal DVD player and 20 movies.",5,7,69
Michael," Could you have picked something stinkier to bring on a plane? [Andy laughs] My God, Oscar. Really? Do you have a bag of baby poop in there too, to share with everybody? No, I will be ordering my own food, thank you very much.",5,7,69
Michael," Oh… okay. [looks back at Andy and Oscar] Doesn’t matter, because I am going to take a nap.  I think I am going to use my complimentary blindfold.  I will don it… and oh! Look at that.  I can’t see because I am in a– [cart crashes into Michael’s leg] GAH!",5,7,69
Michael, [going up escalator in the hotel] This is nice.  This is nice.  Move in here.  Very sweet… ah.,5,7,69
Michael, Yes! Wallace said there would be one of those.,5,7,69
Michael," Wow! Wow, I am blown away by this. I, um… I–ah! This is great, thank you!",5,7,69
Michael," A concierge is like the Winnipeg equivalent of a geisha.  This is a woman who has been trained in the fine art of fanciness and pleasure.  And when you meet one, it is intoxicating.  Just what the doctor ordered.  				",5,7,69
Michael," [goes up to concierge from the hotel] Excuse me, hello. Concierge Marie. Michael Scott.  Good to see you again.",5,7,69
Michael," Um, this is my associate uh, from Dunder Mifflin, uh, Oscar Martinez.",5,7,69
Michael," Works in accounting.  This is uh, concierge Marie…",5,7,69
Michael," …who works at our hotel.  You look, how do you say, radiant tonight.",5,7,69
Michael," And it is, how do you say, a beautiful night—",5,7,69
Michael," Everyone is going to end up dying someday.  And I think it’s better to die with people you like… like Oscar, and Andy, and concierge Marie… than to know that there’s somebody out there that you love that you’re not with.  				",5,7,69
Michael, How about this one? It’s Christmas eve—,5,7,69
Michael, —and everything’s closed and you need to get some dry cleaning done. 12:00 midnight. Where do you go? What do you do?  What do you do? Come on! What do you do?,5,7,69
Michael, [standing outside hotel room… whispering] Do you want to get some breakfast or something?,5,7,69
Michael," Look, people continue to come back to us time and time again because they feel cared for here.  They feel respected and they feel that their needs matter.  They are treated like human beings. [sighs]",5,7,69
Michael," The trip sucked, David. It blew chunks. It was terrible. It was a bad trip.",5,7,69
Michael," I did not like the trip. Well, starting with her airport shuttle which was basically just a van.",5,7,69
Michael, And business class which was basically just coach. And the hotel which sucked big time.,5,7,69
Michael, Oh and thanks for the tip on the concerige.  That was great.  That was great.  That was— that was a—,5,7,69
Michael," No, David. You listen to me.  Why did you send her away? That— God.  You knew I liked her and you just sent her away.  And that— that was a sucky thing to do man.",5,7,69
Michael," Why have I stayed at Dunder Mifflin for so long? Certainly not because of the paycheck.  ‘Cause I could be making more money as a doctor or a professional athlete.  I think it’s because they respect me.  A boss that will not fire you, even though you just tell him off… right to his face… over the hone.  That’s respect.  				",5,7,69
Michael," Oh brownies! I’m taking two so I can parcel them up and eat them at my leisure later on, much healthier.",5,8,70
Michael, Yeah why don’t you send that to him in Costa Rica?,5,8,70
Michael, She said she was going to give it to him right now. [starts laughing],5,8,70
Michael," Hmmm, dare I? [laughs]  You know what? I’m going to, for old time’s sake.  [walks to the annex, standing in Toby’s cubicle] Great practical joke Jim, you got me to go to the annex. [turns around and sees Toby]",5,8,70
Michael," NOOOO! GOD! No, God, please no! No! No! NOOO!  				",5,8,70
Michael, [watching Toby at Phyllis’ desk through his office blinds] Look at him.  With his stupid face.  Stupid… tan. No.,5,8,70
Michael," Uh, well I’m afraid not.  Toby Flenderson, of H.R., has made a sudden reappearance.  ",5,8,70
Michael," Not on the surface, no, but I can tell people are disturbed, David.",5,8,70
Michael," I learned a while back that if I don’t text 911 people will not return my calls.   Um, but now people always return my calls because they think that something horrible has happened.  				",5,8,70
Michael, I did not want to go back to the annex because that is where Holly worked whom I loved.,5,8,70
Michael, I have cause.  It is be-cause I hate him.,5,8,70
Michael," [Dwight comes over, starts to massage Michael’s shoulders] Don’t do that.  				",5,8,70
Michael," You want to see some really high caliber acting?  Well, Mr. Kurt Russell, you are about to be served. [walks to the annex] Hey Toby, great to have you back, man.  Seriously, just a, just a real pleasure to see you again.",5,8,70
Michael, You’re welcome.  Missed you.  Missed you as part of our family.,5,8,70
Michael, So Costa Rica that was – did you have fun?  That must have been fun.,5,8,70
Michael, Why’d you come back?  Why didn’t you stay?,5,8,70
Michael," [shifting uncomfortably and sweating] Shhh hot, why didn’t you get an air-condition— should have gotten an air-conditioner for yourself.",5,8,70
Michael," I tried, I tried.  I tried to talk to Toby and be his friend but that is like trying to be friends with an evil… snail.  I feel like I’m dying inside.  I feel like Neve Campbell in Sream II.  She thinks she can go off to college and be happy and then, the murderer comes back and starts killing off all of her friends.  I learned a lot of lessons from that movie, this is just one of them.  				",5,8,70
Michael," That’s it, that’s it, perfect.  We will get him to hit on somebody, and then we will catch him in the act.",5,8,70
Michael," Mm.  Me too.  Okay, let’s get this started.",5,8,70
Michael," No, for one thing, he’s not gay.  And if somebody were to be bait it would be Jim.  Or Ryan.  Or me.",5,8,70
Michael," Pamtown lady sing this song, doo-dah doo-dah.  Hello, Pam.  Jim may I have a moment with Pam please.",5,8,70
Michael," Oh, oooh his mistress.  No. I’m kidding.  No one would ever cheat on you; you are the complete package, Pam.",5,8,70
Michael," Okay, what I would like you to do is take this folded note, and deliver it to Toby Flenderson?  I just want you to just react to whatever this note elicits.  Do not read it beforehand.  Can you do that for me?",5,8,70
Michael," Good. [Pam stands up and starts reading note] N-no no no, don’t.",5,8,70
Michael," Pam.  Pam, you gave me your word.  				",5,8,70
Michael," Um, I got some photos from Costa Rica if you want to see them?",5,8,70
Michael, Toby can I see those? Ooh. [takes photos and throws them on the floor] What’s the matter?  What’s the matter? You scared?,5,8,70
Michael," Do you want to do that?  You want to hit me, you want to punch me?",5,8,70
Michael," Hey hey! Come on, Ryan, who’s side are you on?",5,8,70
Michael," Not, not as hard as you can, just a good, solid punch.  Come on! Come oooon…",5,8,70
Michael, [mouth full of brownie] Just stop it.  You haven’t done anything helpful all day.,5,8,70
Michael," I’ve never framed a man before, have you?",5,8,70
Michael, Just seems awfully mean.  But sometimes the ends justify the mean.  				,5,8,70
Michael," Hello.  I’ve seen you guys around.  I’m Michael Scott, Dunder Mifflin.   How you doing?  [they stare at him] Uhghh, so I guess you know why I’m here?  I need to purchase something.",5,8,70
Michael," No. Uh, I wanted— I wanted to buy some weed? Some…",5,8,70
Michael," Hey, hey, hey.  Hey.  I forgot… I forgot…  				",5,8,70
Michael," Those are real cops, real guns.  I wonder what’s going on. [follows them]",5,8,70
Michael," Uh, you know what?  I think that this… uh, this is probably a misunderstanding.",5,8,70
Michael," No, that was… that was legitimate.  That was totally legitimate.",5,8,70
Michael," God! No, that’s not… I don’t know what that is.  And I… I bet he has nothing to do with that!",5,8,70
Michael, You must feel pretty good about yourself right now.,5,8,70
Michael, Since when is it illegal to put caprese salad… anywhere. ,5,8,70
Michael," Are you kidding me?  Are you kidding me, that’s who you’re worried about?  You’re… you’re worried about the cop’s time?  You think I framed you, and you’re worried about the taxpayer?  Dah, God! Welcome back, jerky jerk-face.  				",5,8,70
Michael, You said you were leaving and you made liars out of all of us.  So…,5,8,70
Michael," Yes, you did.  And then you came back, which makes you the biggest liar of… history.",5,8,70
Michael, I think you’re great.  You’re my best friend.  				,5,8,70
Michael," Yes. Yes, I can see… that we did indeed. Why don’t you explain this to me like I am an eight-year old.",5,9,71
Michael, Why don’t you explain this to me like I’m five.,5,9,71
Michael, So the dollar’s a surplus. This is a surplus.,5,9,71
Michael," Okay, break it down in terms of, um… okay, I-I think I’m getting you…  				",5,9,71
Michael," Guess what, everybody? Christmas has come early this year. Oscar, very smartly, has discovered an extra $4300 in the budget. Thank you, Oscar. And I have decided with that money I am going to buy a new, drum roll please… [imitates drum roll] Can anybody guess?",5,9,71
Michael," No, a new copier! [only Oscar applauds] Unless everybody can agree on something better?",5,9,71
Michael, So… we all agree to get new chairs then. Good?,5,9,71
Michael," Okay. Okay, good suggestions. All good suggestions. Uh, let’s just decide and agree upon one.",5,9,71
Michael, You are the silent killer. Go back to the annex.,5,9,71
Michael," Wow, okay. Well… I swallowed all your ideas, I’m going to digest them and see what comes out the other end.  				",5,9,71
Michael," Really? Absolutely! Yeah, that would be amazing.",5,9,71
Michael," [through the laughter] Oh, is somebody making fun of me?",5,9,71
Michael," Um, no, not… no. No, I got it at TJ Maxx, four dollars.",5,9,71
Michael, You think that’s good? Check out these pants. Nine dollars.,5,9,71
Michael, Look at that. [begins dancing] Unh. Unh-unh.,5,9,71
Michael," Oh, well, chivalry is not dead after all. Okay…",5,9,71
Michael, Hello! Good to see you! Good to see you.,5,9,71
Michael," Hank, thank God you’re here. The office is at a crossroads.",5,9,71
Michael," Yes. I need your sage advice. And everyone, whatever Hank decides, that is the decision. That will resolve this issue. [Hank takes some jellybeans from Pam’s jar] Yeah, take as many as you want.",5,9,71
Michael," Okay. Well, we have a surplus. Imagine that your parents give you money for a lemonade stand-",5,9,71
Michael," Oh, okay. Good. Good. Well, here’s the thing. Some people want to use the surplus to buy a new copier. Other people are complaining about the chairs.",5,9,71
Michael," Now everyone, bear in mind once again that whatever Hank says goes. He is an impartial third party.",5,9,71
Michael, Hey David- [begins coughing violently] I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I’m eating tiramisu. Some of the chocolate powder just went down my throat. I’m stopping now.,5,9,71
Michael," No, no, no, no, no. No. I’m calling- [coughs again] I’m sorry.",5,9,71
Michael," Mm. I’m calling because, um, we have a stupid budget surplus, and people-everybody wants something different.",5,9,71
Michael," No, no, no. I want you to make the decision so I’m not the bad guy.",5,9,71
Michael, …Like a tip? [calculates amount] $645?!  				,5,9,71
Michael," I hate disappointing just one person. And I really hate disappointing everyone. But I love Burlington Coat Factory. You go in there with $645, you are literally a king.  				",5,9,71
Michael," I have made my decision. We do not need a new copier. We do not need new chairs. This copier… is… [puts paper on glass and makes a copy, then takes paper from glass] working perfectly.",5,9,71
Michael," Pam, would you stand up for a sec? [sits in Pam’s chair] Hmm. See how relaxed I am? I like this chair. [slowly sinking into the chair] Offers good support, it is urkelnomically correct… it’s a good chair. I think we’re spoiled because we don’t appreciate the things that we have. You think kids in Africa have chairs? No. They sit in big piles of garbage. You think they have copiers?  [the chair has slowly lowered itself almost to where Michael is not visible over the desk] They don’t have copiers. They don’t even- [struggles to get up from Pam’s chair] Gah! They don’t even have paper. And we are spoiled because we throw out perfectly good tiramisu because it has a little tiny hair on it. My point I this: I have seen the light in terms of what we need, and it is nothing.",5,9,71
Michael," I don’t need $645; I already have $645, more or less.",5,9,71
Michael," This is so, so stupid. And, God… [looks at his watch] that’s my phone.",5,9,71
Michael," No, I don’t-this doesn’t change anything. I have a very important decision to make. We need a new copier. We need new chairs. And I need to figure out a way to keep this money without having everybody hate me.  				",5,9,71
Michael, [groans in frustration] You think it’s easy?,5,9,71
Michael," Okay, you know what? Why don’t you guys deal with it? I am going to get up, and I am going to be out in the common area. But you need to decide; otherwise I’m taking the bonus. All right?  				",5,9,71
Michael," It is a classic management tactic. You have two sides, a deadline, you know that neither of them are gonna concede. What you do is you put ’em in a room, and you just- [Pam and Oscar come to the door of kitchen] Hey.",5,9,71
Michael, Good work. I’m proud of you. [Pam and Oscar leave] Mother-  				,5,9,71
Michael," [wearing a fur coat] What did we learn this week? Well, one, thanks to me, my team is much, much faster at coming to decisions than I thought they would be. Number two, never buy a fur coat with a credit card until you absolutely have the money to pay for it. And three, [camera zooms out to see fake blood is splattered on the fur coat] you should know that some people think it’s cool to throw buckets of fake blood on you as you are walking out of Burlington Coat Factory.  				",5,9,71
Michael," Hey, Phyllis, do I need this invite to get in to the party? ",5,10,72
Michael, Awesome.  I think this is going to be the best Christmas party ever.  				,5,10,72
Michael," Oh, hey, is that Princess Unicorn?  I thought they were all sold out.",5,10,72
Michael, Cool. [sings] My horn can pierce the sky.  				,5,10,72
Michael," This is equal parts scotch, absinthe, rum, gin, vermouth, triple sec, and two packs of Splenda. Call it a one of everything.",5,10,72
Michael,  Alright… One more time around the block.  				,5,10,72
Michael, That is vodka and I mixed it with orange juice.  I call it an orange-vod-juice…ka.,5,10,72
Michael," [sighs] Oh, so this is what every day would be like if you hadn’t left India.  				",5,10,72
Michael," Can not do it then. Monthly dental appointment, soft teeth",5,10,72
Michael, Why don’t we just do it now? We’ll do it quickly.,5,10,72
Michael, [mimicking] What if we can’t do it quickly? What if we cant do it–,5,10,72
Michael," Hey, shut up. Here we go. Everybody gather up.  				",5,10,72
Michael," An intervention.  It’s sort of hard to describe, but really its– it’s a coming together… it’s a surprise party for people who are– who have addictions.  And you get in their face and you scream at them and you make them feel really badly about themselves.  And then they stop.  				",5,10,72
Michael,"  Okay, you know what I thought we should do is have a quick intervention and then get back to the party.",5,10,72
Michael, I am not asking her to stop drinking.  I am imploring her to quit being an alcoholic.,5,10,72
Michael," Yeah, obviously you are. Okay, everybody who thinks that Meredith is an alcoholic please raise your hand. [everyone raises their hand]",5,10,72
Michael," Alright, well, let’s look at this a little bit closer then shall we? [pulls a piece of paper out of his pocket]  				",5,10,72
Michael," Meredith, have you ever used alcohol to alter your mood or deliberately change your state of mind?",5,10,72
Michael,  Do you sometimes have a drink to celebrate a special occasion or mark a holiday?,5,10,72
Michael, Have you ever under the influence of alcohol questioned the teachings of the Mormon church?,5,10,72
Michael," I got it on a website, that’s not important.",5,10,72
Michael," Okay, you know what Toby?  One of my employees is undergoing a crisis and I wish for just once you would take my side on this.  I’m doing your job man.  Hey, are you texting?",5,10,72
Michael," Alcohol is a drag. Yes.  Here’s what I’d like to do.  I’d like to go around the room and have us each express to Meredith how her alcoholism has affected us.  I’ll begin.  This Christmas party is perhaps the best Christmas party I have ever been to, but then you got so drunk that we had to stop and do this.  That’s how your drinking affected me.  Anybody else?  Another time when Meredith’s drinking affected you?   Come on people.  If we don’t say anything she’s not going to get any better.  [Kevin raises his hand] Yes, Kevin.",5,10,72
Michael,  That’s– you didn’t– you weren’t hurt by that.,5,10,72
Michael," Okay, no, that’s not what we’re going for.  Who has a problem with Meredith’s drinking?  It has to bother you.  It bothers me. Right? How does it bother you?  Dwight, don’t you have anything?",5,10,72
Michael, Who is going to tell us the latest dirty joke?  Who is going to tell us what you watched on television last night?,5,10,72
Michael," Was John Belushi fine?  Was Bob Hope fine?  Hey– come here.  If anything ever happened to you, I would be very angry at myself for not doing all that I could do.",5,10,72
Michael," You can say it as loudly as you want, but we’re not going to believe you.  				",5,10,72
Michael," [amid groans from the rest of the office] Alright, no, no, no.  No. That is the image, I think we can all agree is very disgusting.  But you know what, Meredith, you lit your hair on fire today.  What about tomorrow.?  What is going to happen when you come into work and you’re dead?",5,10,72
Michael," Everyone in this room loves you, but mark my words, we are not going to support your alcoholism anymore.  The next time you light yourself on fire we are not going to help put you out.",5,10,72
Michael," Enabler!  Enabler, enabler, enabler, enabler, enabler.  It’s Christmas and we are turning our back on somebody who is asking for help.  				",5,10,72
Michael," You know what the only thing I want for Christmas? I want Meredith to get better.  That’s my only wish.  But you know what?  My wishes never come true, so I’m not going to wish that on her. I– a watch would be nice.  				",5,10,72
Michael, [whispers to Meredith] I’ll be down in a minute. [walks over to Toby] Could you write down the number of that rehabilitation center that you mentioned? ,5,10,72
Michael," Oh, shoot.  Oh well, we’ll have to go someplace else then I guess.",5,10,72
Michael," Meredith, we are doing this for your own good.  Okay. Come on–",5,10,72
Michael, Yes you are. [tries to pull Meredith from the car],5,10,72
Michael, [dragging Meredith on the floor into the rehab center] Let’s start meeting– Hello. How are you?,5,10,72
Michael, As it turns out you can’t just check someone into rehab against their will.  They have to do it voluntarily.  They have to hit rock bottom.  So I think I know what I need to do at this point.  I need to find ways to push Meredith to the bottom.  Um… I think I can do it.  I did it with Jan.  				,5,10,72
Michael," Dwight, there was wind. I want a do-over.",5,11,73
Michael, I want another try. Here we go! [Michael runs past the radar as a car passes] Thirty-one! Thirty-one!,5,11,73
Michael, I was ahead of the car. Thirty-one is my new number.,5,11,73
Michael," Today’s a big day. My presence has been requested by [in an authoritative voice] Chief Financial Officer, David Wallace. [in normal voice] He says that he wants to talk about big picture stuff. And, I’ll be honest, I have little or no idea what that means, so… probably bad.  				",5,11,73
Michael," [from inside his office] No, what I’m saying is…",5,11,73
Michael, [to Dwight] Are you still having intercourse with her? [Dwight’s expression implies ‘yes’],5,11,73
Michael, Did you ever have intercourse in this office? [Dwight’s expression implies ‘yes’],5,11,73
Michael, Come on. [Dwight and Jim follow into Michael’s office],5,11,73
Michael," [sighs] Jim, this has to get out, so we can all deal with it.",5,11,73
Michael," Ohh, I do not have much time… car’s all the way over there, to tell you what I have to tell you. And just bear in mind when I say… say these things, that… are bad things… that you hear… in your ears… this is something that I, if I were you, that I wouldn’t want to hear…",5,11,73
Michael," Well… no, I’m not. So I… I’m not very articulate today, so I’ll just leave it for another time. Another day.",5,11,73
Michael," [through the car window] Okay. I will… Dwight and Angela are having an affair, so…",5,11,73
Michael, [rolls down car window] Dwight and Angela are having an affair. They’ve been sleeping together for some time. That was the news. I wanted to let you know.,5,11,73
Michael, All right. See you later. [backs out of the parking space] Ahh.,5,11,73
Michael," David, here it is. My philosophy is basically this. And this is something that I live by. And I always have. And I always will. Don’t ever, for any reason, do anything to anyone, for any reason, ever, no matter what. No matter… where. Or who, or who you are with, or, or where you are going, or… or where you’ve been… ever. For any reason, whatsoever.  				",5,11,73
Michael," Sometimes I’ll start a sentence, and I don’t even know where it’s going. I just hope I find it along the way. Like an improv conversation. An improversation.  				",5,11,73
Michael," This is going to sound sort of high-maintenance, but could we have it, like, three degrees cooler in here? I always think better when it’s cooler.  				",5,11,73
Michael," [pokes his head in] Hey, what say we order up some pasta?",5,11,73
Michael," So I was in the office, and I look over to our Accounting division, and there is Kevin Malone. Kevin is wearing a jacket that I’ve never seen before. And I call over to Kevin, “Kevin, is that a tweed jacket?” And he looks at me and he says, “Michael, yes it is a tweed jacket.” And I look back at him and I say, “I feel the need!… The need for tweed.”",5,11,73
Michael," I have to say, I am so impressed with the potential you see in me.",5,11,73
Michael, Okay. [sits back down to continue eating],5,11,73
Michael," Wow, what a day! Haha! I thought I was gong to get chewed out, but, hold on! Here’s an attaboy for ya! What? Rollercoaster ride! Rollercoaster! It just goes to show, you leave Scranton, exciting things can happen. [sighs] Ahh!  				",5,11,73
Michael," What you talking bout, Wallace? [imitating What you talking bout Willis]",5,12,74
Michael," Fax, why don’t you just send it over on a dinosaur?",5,12,74
Michael," Yeah, so what if I did? That would take precedence and I would expect your support.",5,12,74
Michael," Alright, I am a local business owner. [Dwight nods along] I need to buy paper.  I find out everything about their prices and policies",5,12,74
Michael, You know what? I don’t want to get into this debate again. I enjoy IHOP.,5,12,74
Michael, You will have pancakes and you’ll like it.  ,5,12,74
Michael, Ah ha [popping something in his mouth] Yup. ,5,12,74
Michael," And there are clouds. There are clouds in the sky, which means gonna rain, bad for business.",5,12,74
Michael, Good. Here come the sharks. [they imitate jaws theme sounds and Dwight makes shark fin on his forehead]  ,5,12,74
Michael," In nature, there is something called a food chain; it’s where the shark eats a little shark. And the little shark eats a littler shark. And so on and so on. Until you get down to the single cell shark. So now replace sharks with paper companies and that is all you need to know about business.  ",5,12,74
Michael, My name is Michael Scarn. I am a local business owner and I would like to find out about your company.,5,12,74
Michael," You know, I will be honest with you… about something. Where we used to live, our paper supplier had a lot of big clients and I just didn’t feel like a priority. So I guess my question [reaches for paper in his pocket with questions on it] for you would be [reading off sheet] how many clients do you have?",5,12,74
Michael, Really? That many? This doesn’t seem like a very big operation.,5,12,74
Michael," So, even specialty paper, say 94 brightness double-bonded, you would put that on the same truck as your conventional stock?",5,12,74
Michael," Yes, well about some things, and other things I am very stupid. Like, watch this. Is this the cup? [picks up tape dispenser and makes drinking motion] Is this the cup? [picks up a stapler and makes drinking motion] Is this what I drink out of? [glug noise, both laugh] Laughter is my job, tears are my game, law is my profession. ",5,12,74
Michael," Don’t blow it. Hey Linda, can I get a picture of you?",5,12,74
Michael," I would, could you just stand over here? That would be great [positioning her towards sign of Prince Family Paper customers] Just a little something to remember the trip by. A little to your left [positions Linda to get better picture]",5,12,74
Michael," What’s going on?  Little homework over here? Lets see if I can help. Huh, math, that’s not so hard. Ok. There are 4 of these, ignore the parenthesis, right?",5,12,74
Michael," Why is this little 2 so small? It’s, it’s weird, you don’t, you just go by the x. The x means times. 4 times x 2. What is double 4?",5,12,74
Michael, Excellent! Way to go! Nice! [Michael and granddaughter Prince exchange high fives],5,12,74
Michael," Oh, well thank you very much for all of your help. It’s going to be an incredibly hard decision.",5,12,74
Michael," I… Okay, okay, okay, [in disbelief] alright, thank you. [heads towards Dwight, makes make out lips signal]",5,12,74
Michael, Of course. Thank you very much. Thanks for your time.,5,12,74
Michael," No no, we are fine. You have done enough already.",5,12,74
Michael," Just, shut up. You know we are just going to call a tow truck, so…",5,12,74
Michael, You know let me give you some money for this. ,5,12,74
Michael," Oh coffee, that’s too much. [Dwight drinks it]",5,12,74
Michael," Dwight, what will happen to that family if I call David and give him this information?",5,12,74
Michael," Ok. You know, our sales are fine. We’re doing fine. They’re doing fine. ",5,12,74
Michael, That is true. We have gone down the wrong path many many times.,5,12,74
Michael, You are right. I will call David and give him the customer list and I will give him all my info.,5,12,74
Michael," Somewhere safe, where it can’t hurt anyone [starts running, Dwight follows]",5,12,74
Michael, Oh shoot! [gets to his car turns around],5,12,74
Michael, Those people will be ruined. [runs out back door],5,12,74
Michael," Give it, give it. We can’t do this to those people. ",5,12,74
Michael, I guess this is what they call a bittersweet moment. It is bitter because I slightly destroyed a wonderful little family. But sweet because David Wallace thought I did a good job. That’s what I hate bittersweet chocolate. I don’t even… what’s the point of that? Why not just sweet? Who are you helping?   ,5,12,74
Michael," Oh, she is hot. [“Hillary Swank is hot” supporters cheer]  ",5,12,74
Michael," Oh my God! Okay, it happening.  Everybody stay calm. ",5,13,75
Michael," Okay, we’re trapped.  Everyone for himself.",5,13,75
Michael, [throws the projector out the window] Help!! Help!!,5,13,75
Michael," No, no, no! You will not die! Stanley! Stanley! You will not die!  Stanley! Stanley! Barack is president!  You are black, Stanley! I’m gonna give him mouth to mouth.",5,13,75
Michael, Open your mouth.  Come on. Don’t swallow it.,5,13,75
Michael," Okay. [walks to the window, sighs] This city.  Dwight. We are not mad, we are just disappointed. ",5,13,75
Michael, Yes. We are. We are livid.  But we are going to let this one slide.,5,13,75
Michael, And we should take a part of his pay and donate it the charity of your choice.  Something that Dwight doesn’t like. ,5,13,75
Michael," [sighs] No, Dwight.  I am worried.  A man’s life is in my hands.",5,13,75
Michael, That’s not gonna happen. I’m taking over as safety man.,5,13,75
Michael," Nobody should have to go to work thinking, “Oh, this is the place that I might die today.”  That’s what a hospital is for. An office is for not dying.  An office is a place to live life to the fullest, to the max, to… An office is a place where dreams come true.   				",5,13,75
Michael," Shhh! Don’t excite him. Don’t make him excitable. [whispering] Welcome back, Stanley. ",5,13,75
Michael," No, no, no. No debate. You are going to sit in that wheelchair until you are back on your feet.  				",5,13,75
Michael," Okay, you know what? That could be a little confusing, because in sales A-B-C means “always be closing.”",5,13,75
Michael," We found ourselves on the less prepared side of things when Stanley had his… when his heart went berserk. And I knew exactly what to do, but in a much more real sense I had no idea what to do.  So I thought we should have CPR training class and of course you can’t get the practice dummy unless the instructor comes along with it. Red Cross, you know, racket.   				",5,13,75
Michael, You know who I really think should go? Stanley.,5,13,75
Michael, No rest for the sick. We are not always going to be there to coddle your heart back when it disappears to be working.  What are you gonna do if you’re by yourself and your heart stops?,5,13,75
Michael," Uh-uh.  No, no, no.  Come on. Get up.  Let’s do this.   				",5,13,75
Michael, Come on Stanley.  You’re losing you.  You’re losing you. Do it!,5,13,75
Michael," Okay, okay.  I’ll show them. Here we go. [whispers] Stanley.  All right.  ",5,13,75
Michael," No, Rose. They are not breathing.  And they have no arms or legs. ",5,13,75
Michael," Where are they?  You know what? If we come across somebody with no arms or legs do we bother resuscitating them? I mean, what kind of quality of life do we have there?",5,13,75
Michael," How about no arms? No arms or legs is basically how you exist right now, Kevin. You don’t do anything.",5,13,75
Michael," okay, that’s uh, hard to keep track.  How many is that per hour?",5,13,75
Michael," Yes, yes I do.  I love that song. [clears throat, begins to sing] First I was afraid, I was petrified.",5,13,75
Michael," Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, stayin’ alive, stayin’ alive [Andy joins in] Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, stayin’ alive, stayin’ alive.",5,13,75
Michael, Five thousand three hundred dollars for a dummy?,5,13,75
Michael," Okay, look. David, this is why we have training.  We start with the dummy, and we learn from our mistakes. And now Dwight knows not to cut the face off of a real person.   				",5,13,75
Michael," Hi, everyone.  Corporate has given Dwight two strikes. They are very, very upset with him. So, as a disciplinary measure he is going to have to issue a formal apology. Dwight, have you prepared your statement of regret? ",5,13,75
Michael, [in a monk-impression tone] Ohmmm… Ohmmm… Everybody sit on the floor Indian style like me. [Meredtih sits Indian style in a dress exposing herself right in front of Michael] Ohmmm my God if you’re wearing a dress please keep your knees together nobody wants to see that ohmmm… ohmmm…   				,5,13,75
Michael, My goal is to make this office as peaceful a place for Stanley Hudson as I can. I think sounds have a lot to do with that. Here are some downloaded peaceful sounds. [a couple of sounds play on the computer] That one makes me think… of death. It’s kinda nice…   				,5,13,75
Michael," [everyone is lying on the floor in the conference room with the light off, Michael is walking around with a candle in his hand] It is a beautiful, sunny day as we walk through the meadow that is very spiritual and relaxing and there are flowers and it is sunny and beautiful. Now, up ahead, a castle, in a distance.",5,13,75
Michael," And you walk up toward the castle, and inside the castle are 4 men, and each of them, none of them have shoes, and they give you a funny cigarette, and you feel even more relaxed, and then you want ice cream. You want a big bowl of ice cream. What kind do you want? Shout it out.",5,13,75
Michael," Racism is dead Stanley, you can have any kind of ice cream you want. What do you want? [beeping starts] What is that? People! Please I told you to get rid of the cell phones.",5,13,75
Michael," Oh, ok. What is that, like, a video game?",5,13,75
Michael," No no, I’ll help you. I’ll help you up. Here we go.",5,13,75
Michael," Ok… I think that thing is on the fritz. Ahh… Oscar, would you reach over and touch his thing? That’s what HE said! Right guys, ’cause of gay? [Oscar has Stanley’s monitor now] Let’s give this a shot.",5,13,75
Michael, Hellloo… [beeping speeds up as Michael gets closer],5,13,75
Michael, So… it wasn’t Dwight after all. Looks like I am the killer. You never expect that you’re the killer… it’s uh… great twist. Great twist.  				,5,13,75
Michael," Remember when people used to say boss, when they were describing something that was really cool like, those shoulder pads are really boss man… Look at that perm, that perm is so boss. It’s what made me want to become a boss. And I looked so good in a perm and shoulder pads. But now, boss is just slang for jerk in charge.   				",5,13,75
Michael," Ok everybody, I’ve figured it out. The reason that you are all so stressed around me is that you are too intimidated to tell me what you really think. [Jim shakes his head at the camera] You are keeping these feelings inside, and that is what’s causing stress. So, what is the solution? Solution is honesty, laughter, and comedy. In short… ",5,13,75
Michael," What? No. No, I am talking about a roast! Of Michael Scott! Oh c’mon! Who here has the Comedy Central Roast channel? You’ve seen it right? Everybody gets together, and everyone starts hurling insults at the one guy, and everybody’s laughing, and everybody’s hugging each other… ",5,13,75
Michael," It’s not! It’s not offensive during a roast! Anything goes! I want you guys to really get crackin on this. I want you to take me down. Don’t hold back. I want you to really make fun of anything about me. It could be my race, could be the fact that I’m so fit, or I’m a womanizer… fair game. Whatever. I don’t want to write your stuff for you, but I just want it to be good.  				",5,13,75
Michael, I can already feel people’s stress starting to melt. I think they’re very excited about paying their respects this way. I have got to make sure that YouTube comes down to tape this.  				,5,13,75
Michael," Whoo!! Welcome welcome welcome welcome welcome. You are all jerks. Just kidding, not yet anyway. Welcome to the roast of Mr. Michael Scott. If you’re here for the Grabowski wedding, it is the second door on the left. [Creed looks around] So, we all know how these work, needs to get crazy, take your best shot. I am going to sit right here on my chair and… ah… whoever wants to come up and roast me, you may. [Angela jumps up] Ok… lower the mic for the midget.",5,13,75
Michael," Hey Hey, I don’t go make burgers where you work and then tell you how to make burgers. Ha ha!  				",5,13,75
Michael, You’re so lucky! Good one… [clapping]  				,5,13,75
Michael," Pow pow pow… [hands making gunshot impression, sporadic clapping]  				",5,13,75
Michael," [Toby tries to come on stage] NO! No, friends only. Friends ONLY. [Toby shrugs and sits back down]  				",5,13,75
Michael, Dwight your’e supposed to do it this way.,5,13,75
Michael," That is the way you’re supposed to do it, idiot.",5,13,75
Michael," Hey, ya know what? Forgive me for caring. Right?",5,13,75
Michael," Can I make just a little announcement. In a professional roast, usually the roaster will say something nice about the roastee after they’re done, something about how much they love them, so, just, keep that in mind.  				",5,13,75
Michael, I don’t believe I have had the pleasure.,5,13,75
Michael," Haha ha. Thank you very much, thank you. That was great. Great job, great laughs. Really, really went after my intelligence there. [clears throat] Dozens of online IQ test might prove you wrong, but, and my thing isn’t tiny, its average, so… get your facts straight. [clears throat again] So when I heard that there was going to be a roast in my honor, I thought [choking up, clears throat again] sorry. [laughs nervously] I think I have a frog in my throat. Um… [sigh] I decided to jot down some quick thoughts about you people, um, first up Phyllis and Kevin. Uh um… [Michael walks off stage, knocking over the snare drum]  				",5,13,75
Michael, [at a park throwing whole pieces of bread] Caw… caw… caw caw… caw…   				,5,13,75
Michael," You know sometimes, to get perspective, I like to think about a spaceman on a star incredibly far away. And, our problems don’t matter to him, because we’re just a distant point of light. But he feels sorry for me, because he has an incredibly powerful microscope, and he can see my face. [looks towards the sky] I’m okay. No, I’m not.  				",5,13,75
Michael," I um, I spent the afternoon in the park trying to feed the pigeons, I guess they all flew west for the winter, and I, I just had some thoughts that I wanted to share with you people.",5,13,75
Michael," Well I wrote them down so I wouldn’t forget. Jim, you’re 6’11 and you weigh 90 pounds, Gumby has a better body than you. Boom. Roasted. Dwight, you’re a kiss ass. Boom. Roasted. Pam, you failed art school. Boom. Roasted. Meredith, you’ve slept with so many guys you’re starting to look like one. Boom. Roasted. Kevin, I can’t decide between a fat joke and a dumb joke. Boom. Roasted. Creed, you’re teeth called, your breath stinks. Boom. Roasted. Angela where’s Angela? [Angela raises her hand] Whoa there you are, I didn’t see you there behind that grain of rice. Boom. Roasted. Stanley, you crush your wife during sex and your heart sucks. Boom. Roasted. Oscar, you are… [Stanley is laughing] Oscar, you’re gay.",5,13,75
Michael," Andy, Cornell called, they think you suck. And you’re gayer than Oscar. Boom. Roasted. [Stanley is still laughing] Alright. Alright everybody, you know I kid, you know I kid. You guys are the reason I went into the paper business, so, uh, goodnight, God bless, God bless America, and get home safe. [clapping and murmurs of appreciation]  				",5,13,75
Michael," They say that laughter is the best medicine so Stanley, you can throw away those pills. You are cured. Actually, you should… better hold onto  them pills, just in case.  				",5,13,75
Michael," [over PA] This is your captain speaking, the office will be flying at an altitude of two stories. Look out your left hand window and you will see Vance Refrigeration. [snickering] I am the ghost of salesman past, do not come near me. [wheezing laughing, starts coughing] Yes Michael Scott for Dr. Jocelyn, please. Hello doctor I was just following up on my mole again. No, I was looking online about sebaceous cysts. I have not been squeezing it.",5,14,76
Michael," [still talking over PA] Toby Flenderson to the principal’s office. Your mother called, and it appears that you wet the bed again. So you have to get home to wash your sheets [Jim stands up, puts scissors in back pocket] because they are yellow and they’re wet with your urine.",5,14,76
Michael," You, and at six foot six, from the University of North Carolina, Jiiiiim Halpeeeeert.",5,14,76
Michael, Would you like fries with that? Please drive around.  				,5,14,76
Michael," [knocks on Pam’s hotel door] Hello, good morning.",5,14,76
Michael," You ready? And we’re off, like a herd of turtles.  				",5,14,76
Michael," Well, Pam and I have eloped. Actually we just robbed a bank, and we are on the lam. [laughs] No, uh,  seriously, I am on a lecture circuit. Apparently Scranton has the best sales of any regional branch. So David Wallace has asked me to go to all the branches, except Nashua, still a little bit raw there. Um, but I am going to these branches and sharing my secret recipe for success. My 11 business herbs and spices, in a sales batter. [looks at Pam] Oh that, well, that is Pam. Pam is coming along as my assistant and my driver so I can focus. And I like to pack heavy.",5,14,76
Michael," No! That is a toboggan, you never know when you’re gonna find a snowy hill so… Every magician has a hot assistant, and every rock star has a roadie, and Pam is my hot roadie.",5,14,76
Michael," Yeah, oh don’t say bucks, it’s not lady like. Here we go! [gets in backseat] Okay so what we do is drive all day and we stay in hotels together at night.",5,14,76
Michael," Hey! Look at what you’re wearing again, Pam. Have you ever seen a magician’s assistant?  That’s…",5,14,76
Michael,  …kind of [retches] Maybe you could tie it around your waist or lose the shirt underneath or something.,5,14,76
Michael, No. I need silence or Sam Kinison to prepare.,5,14,76
Michael, Well then… hey you know what then let’s just talk.,5,14,76
Michael," You nervous about seeing Karen again, since she was the other woman? Actually you were the other woman so…",5,14,76
Michael," Rolando, [clears throat] I’d like you to meet Pam. She is our receptionist. You know what? Maybe you guys could go out on a little friend date sometime.",5,14,76
Michael," Okay, don’t be nervous, just picture her naked.",5,14,76
Michael, [notices Karen’s pregnant] Oh my God. Is that Jim’s?,5,14,76
Michael," Okay. Wow. Oh man! My head just exploded. Whoo! Thank God, for everybody right? Whoo kay. Wow, you’re huge! That’s incredible! I… God sorry, sorry my head is… I’m just, I’m trying to figure out the last time that you and Jim had sex, and…",5,14,76
Michael," [on cell phone] NO! Oh, my God. Oh, No. That is so awful. That is the worst news. I have to go. I have to do a presentation. I’ll talk to you… [hangs up phone, sighs] This is going to be hard for me to speak today. Because I just learned that my father has died. … No, he didn’t! He is alive. And this isn’t even a cell phone. This is a calculator. But you bought it! And now you can’t return it. Or can you? No you can’t. [Karen raises her hand] Yes. Karen, do you need to go pump?",5,14,76
Michael," I am talking about, how you all need to sell an experience. Like I sold you on the idea that my father had died.",5,14,76
Michael, Would a liar bring mini Mounds bars? [Pam tosses a handful of Mounds bars at everyone]  				,5,14,76
Michael," I am a theatrical person. Growing up, I always thought I would become an actor. Because I have, these memorization tricks that I use. Um, for instance, I learned the Pledge of Allegiance by setting it to the tune of Old MacDonald. [starts singing] I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God. With a woof-woof here, and a woof-woof there. Here a woof, there a woof. Everywhere a woof, woof. Um, you get it.  				",5,14,76
Michael," I don’t know you. But I need to know you in order to sell to you. That is why I have asked you to go around and tell me you names. I have an amazing mnemonic device, by which I have memorized all of your names. Shirty, mole, lazy eye, Mexico, baldy, sugar boobs, black woman. I have taken a unique part of who you are, and I have used that to memorize your name. Baldy, your head is bald. It is hairless. It is shiny, it is reflective like a mirror. “M” your name is Mark.",5,14,76
Michael, But it works. I would like you all to give this a shot. What do you say?,5,14,76
Michael," Well, then it will be easier for you. But I, I still think it’s worthwhile, to give a, give it a try.",5,14,76
Michael," She is pregnant. She is knocked up. “K” Karen. Pam, let’s go.  				",5,14,76
Michael," I grab this [grabs a chain saw], and I turn it on and I say, “Prepare yourself, for the Utica chain store massacre.”",5,14,76
Michael," Email’s not scary. This is an opportunity. Don’t, don’t blow it.",5,14,76
Michael," It’s really amazing. Congratulations Karen. So is there a guy or, uh, a person. Or, uh, a sperm machine that did this to you, or?",5,14,76
Michael," No, it’s really dorky. You were right the first time.",5,14,76
Michael, Old hatreds dissolve into new friendships. It’s a really wonderful moment.  				,5,14,76
Michael," I would give that lecture a solid B+. Although, for the record, Karen. Wow, kind of mean.",5,14,76
Michael," Really? No, honestly. Tell me what you really think.",5,14,76
Michael," No.  I’m just thinking about what you said, about Karen, about closure. You remember Holly? She used to work for H.R.?",5,14,76
Michael," Blonde hair, nice boobs. Not too big, not too small.",5,14,76
Michael," She was the love of my life. What you and Jim have times 100. Just she… she just left. And I didn’t… I never got closure, you know? I never got closure with her. I haven’t talked to her since. I haven’t seen her since. And I feel like I need to go to Nashua and get closure. I feel like I need that.",5,14,76
Michael, [scoofs] I’ll just blow off the lecture at Rochester.,5,14,76
Michael, [holding a chainsaw] And I turn it on and I say ‘Prepare yourself for the Utica Chainsaw Massacre.’  ,5,15,77
Michael, You remember Holly? She used to work for HR? She’s the love of my life. She just left… and I never got closure. And I feel like I need to go to Nashua and get closure.,5,15,77
Michael," Yes, you can. I am, uh, Michael Scott, Regional Manager of the Scranton branch.",5,15,77
Michael," Thank you. … Um… is, uh, Holly Flax anywhere here?",5,15,77
Michael," I can’t do the presentation, I can’t- [voice cracks] … just… oh… thinking about seeing him… and… thinking about… him getting to hold her and getting to kiss her, it just- oh, God! [starts crying, covers his face]",5,15,77
Michael," I know, just… uh, please, I’m going through something, okay? [exhales]",5,15,77
Michael, And then she’ll move back to Scranton. And her boyfriend will die.,5,15,77
Michael," Goooood morning, Viet-Nashua! Sales. Sales is what bwings us together, today. How do we deal with clients who say, “Frankly, my dear, I don’t give a damn… about paper” and get them to “Show us the money!” Well, we are going to find out today. Show of hands. How many of you are salesmen? Let’s see the salesmen. [some raise their hands] Oh, okay. Well I know what the rest of you are thinking. Wow, yuck. Salesmen are the worst! They are awful. They are so arrogant. They think the whole place revolves around them. Handsome, good listeners, funny, Mr. Wonderful. So, okay, you’re a salesman. What’s, uh, what’s your name?",5,15,77
Michael," Ooh. Ouch. Okay, good. You’re funny, very good and funny. Tell me, A.J., are you dating? Is there somebody you date?",5,15,77
Michael," Yep, we will get to you. Okay, so you’re dating somebody? Um… is it serious?",5,15,77
Michael, Huh- [pauses] Does she ever talk about me? [voice cracking],5,15,77
Michael, It’s all connected. Shut up. [to A.J.] Does she ever mention ‘Michael Scott?’,5,15,77
Michael," [grunts] Your life. [sits down, upset] Oh, wow. Whew. Ahh, legs are sorta giving out. Long drive in the car, so let’s just- We’ll just continue. [sighs, falls to floor, gets more upset] Oh, wow. [takes deep breath] Ooh, okay.",5,15,77
Michael," Yeah, yeah… uh, I can’t do this Pam. Just read from- just read the cards. ",5,15,77
Michael," No, no, I’m okay. I’m all right. [sighs heavily] Okay… okay.",5,15,77
Michael," [sighs, touches Holly’s sweater, cuts off sleeve, chuckles, sees Word document on Holly’s computer named “Dear Michael,” plugs in USB flash drive to copy file from computer]  ",5,15,77
Michael, I also stole something off of her computer. A document called “Dear Michael.”,5,15,77
Michael, I shouldn’t have done it. It just- I couldn’t help it.,5,15,77
Michael," I know, I know. You’re right, you’re right.",5,15,77
Michael, She said that? Is that what it said? What did it say?,5,15,77
Michael, I feel great. So good to have closure. Ah! We should go apologize to Roy or something.,5,15,77
Michael," Who have I wronged? Who have I wronged? Oh, oh! What about that fat guy from Stamford that I insulted? We should find him!",5,15,77
Michael," Jabba the hut, Pizza the hut, Fat guys like pizza, pepperoni pizza, pepperoni Tony!",5,15,77
Michael," Man, was he fat. So, so… fat. You know what, forget it. I know me. When I saw him, I would never be able to apologize to him. Too fat. Big fat fatty.   ",5,15,77
Michael," [coming out from his office] Hello, may I help you?",5,16,78
Michael, That was funny.  Let’s go do it to somebody else.   Ayyyy!  				,5,16,78
Michael," Oh, look at that.  Cupids and hearts. Really shoving our faces in it this year.  You doin OK, bud?",5,16,78
Michael," Yeah, I hear ya.   It’s been four months since I was with Holly, and she was way hotter then Stacy.  So if you think you’re hurting…",5,16,78
Michael," Oh, wow look at those.  How nice for you.  Up there, front and center, beautiful.  I think they would look better right here.  [Michael takes the flowers from Pam’s desk and puts them on the ground off to the side]  They’re very pretty and I wouldn’t want them to fall.  [Kevin groans]  				",5,16,78
Michael," Just about everyone in this office is single right now.   Including me.  And everyone is experiencing an incredible amount of emotional pain.  Especially me, because of my great capacity for emotion, and it is my first Valentine’s Day since Holly, so I think that I am well qualified to understand that these people need to be protected from having love shoved into their faces.  				",5,16,78
Michael," Yes, um, Jim.  Today is a very difficult day for a lot of people in this office.",5,16,78
Michael," Yeah.  And the sexy looks between you and Pam, the general sexiness, the flowers, it’s creating a bit of a hostile work environment.",5,16,78
Michael," Well, if you guys insist on having your own private little love fest–",5,16,78
Michael," [gesturing Pam to be quiet] –then, we, are gonna have our own private Valentine’s Day party.",5,16,78
Michael," So suck it.   Hey everybody, I just invited Jim to suck it, and I am cordially inviting all of you to a special convention, a lonely heart’s convention, this afternoon. Singles only.",5,16,78
Michael," So we may not have someone in our lives that we love, but we do have each other.  				",5,16,78
Michael," I am about to give blood.  The gift of everlasting life, the transfer of my bodily fluids, oh wow, that’s a big needle, that —",5,16,78
Michael," Yeah, can I point something out to you?  ",5,16,78
Michael," Yup, I’m good, whew.  Wow, I feel like a human juicebox. [Blood Girl laughs] Hawaiian blood punch.",5,16,78
Michael," Could you distract me for a second, just talk about things that don’t have blood in them?",5,16,78
Michael," Whew, wow I was so nervous about this I don’t think I ate for three days. [Michael passes out]",5,16,78
Michael," [ccming to] Oh my God, how long was I out?  [Michael looks over where Blood Girl was and sees Hank]",5,16,78
Michael," Excuse me, waitress, where did the lady go?",5,16,78
Michael," OK.  Oh, wait a second, wait a second, that’s hers.   This is hers, she left her glove.  I need her name if I’m gonna return her glove.",5,16,78
Michael," Well here we all are.  Alone but together.  No flowers for us. [in a Mexican accent] Relationships, we don’t need no stinking relationships.   I think we should all go around and tell our worst relationship story, and then get past it, just blow through it, yeah? Kelly, what about Ryan?  He treated you pretty terribly, yeah?",5,16,78
Michael," Yeah, but now his heart is in Thailand along with the rest of his body having random sex. [Kelly looks hurt]  Okay, sorry, let’s, who else?  Oscar.",5,16,78
Michael," Come on, I’m sure there’s something you need to get off your chest.",5,16,78
Michael," If you wanna just, anything? Are you sure?  I’m sure whatever you did it wasn’t your fault.  OK well, who else?  				",5,16,78
Michael," Moron, if he was there wouldn’t be a story.",5,16,78
Michael," Well then it’s a happy ending, because he was gay. You should call him!",5,16,78
Michael, You know what guys? I don’t think we need to do this.,5,16,78
Michael," No, no, no, no.  I mean have this kind of party. I look around and I see all these beautiful people who are alone on Valentine’s, and I think that there are other single people out there too.  We just need to find them.  There’s a girl out there for all of us maybe even in this office park.  There has to be a way to get all these lonely people together.",5,16,78
Michael," These people need love and I am going to get it for them  Who cares if we sell a little bit less paper today?  A great boss cares more about the happiness of his employees then anything else.  I am going to be cupid, and I am going to shoot my sparrow at unsuspecting victims, and they are going to get hit and say “I’m in love I was hit by cupid’s sparrow.”  Funny little bird, but he gets the job done.    				",5,16,78
Michael," No.  No, I meant about being single today.",5,16,78
Michael," Hello. [two women, a blonde and a redhead, enter the office.  Michael and Dwight walk towards them and Dwight extends his hand to the redhead] ",5,16,78
Michael," Babe alert! [to the redhead]  Hello, I’m Michael Scott, welcome to our little shindig.",5,16,78
Michael," Lynn, follow me, come on in.  For you we have one of our top people Kevin Malone.  Kevin, come out here show your beautiful self.",5,16,78
Michael," [after a short pause] So run with the ball! Run with it, Kev.  [after another pause] Where you from?",5,16,78
Michael," So, Eric.  You mentioned before that you are in tool and dye repair.",5,16,78
Michael," Meredith recently had a total hysterectomy, so that’s sort of a repair.  Alright, I’ll let you guys talk.  				",5,16,78
Michael," It’s going very well.  People are mixing, a lot of hope.  Cause that’s what you hate to see, when hope gets crushed. [Michael suddenly turns to look at the open entrance door] Sorry, thought I heard somebody coming in.  Um, so [looking at his watch] it’s not too late.  				",5,16,78
Michael," Nobody’s after me, I just, I met a woman when I was giving blood and I thought she might come by.",5,16,78
Michael," It’s not a big deal really, I just, you know met somebody, we hardly talked, I picked up her glove so I was hoping I could give it back to her.",5,16,78
Michael," Believe me its nothing.  I hardly even talked to her we just, we were lying there next to each other, I think our blood bags touched.",5,16,78
Michael, Nah. [everyone groans and Girl turns around and walks away.  				,5,16,78
Michael," Really? [everybody signifies their agreement, and Kelly gives Michael a piece of cake]  Oh, thanks.",5,16,78
Michael," You know what, you guys, you guys can get out I’m gonna soldier on a little bit.",5,16,78
Michael," Four months ago, I dated a woman named Holly and, um, this is actually the first time that I’ve even considered getting back into that arena again.  You know what, sometimes it’s not about whether Cinderella gets her slipper back, but it’s about the fact that the prince even picked up the slipper at all.   There’s a lot of princesses out there.  You know, they have all different sizes and shapes of feet and hands so I think, I think my odds are pretty good.  				",5,16,78
Michael," They would never know it was me doing it. Here we go, Knock, knock. [Dwight walks over]",5,17,79
Michael," [puts a slice of bread and stick of butter on Pam’s desk] Buddha this bread for me, won’t you? [Michael and Dwight laugh]",5,17,79
Michael, KGB – [Dwight slaps Michael on the face],5,17,79
Michael, What the hell was that? [Michael starts to fight with Dwight],5,17,79
Michael, Mine was retribution. What are you doing? No more knock-knock jokes. That’s it. ,5,17,79
Michael," Oh, no, no, no, no. I am not Michael. I am Willy Wonkaaaaa. ",5,17,79
Michael," Why thank you very much. [notices jelly beans] Oh, what are those? What are those? Tell me, please!",5,17,79
Michael," No, no, no. They are not just ordinary jelly beans little girl. These are extraordinary jelly beans!   ",5,17,79
Michael," The Willy Wonka Golden Ticket promotional idea is probably the best idea I have ever had. It’s probably the best idea anybody has ever had. Three days ago, I slipped five pieces of gold paper into random paper shipments. This entitles the customer to ten percent off of their total order. It will be a day for them that is full of whimsy, and full of excitement and full of fantasy.   ",5,17,79
Michael," I’ve written these things because it is my responsibility, as manager of this branch, to profiligate great ideas and I think I have done my part with the golden ticket promotion. Now it is your turn. I want to hear some great ideas from you that are just as good as mine. [Jim raises hand] Umm hmm.",5,17,79
Michael, Too many words. Good ideas are simple. ‘Golden ticket.’,5,17,79
Michael, No. Jim. We’re a business. Post-its. That is a golden ticket idea. NASA took five or six golden ticket ideas to get man on the moon. ,5,17,79
Michael," No, you don’t. No, it – [sighs] What will be the state of this company if I am the only one coming up with the great ideas? Right?   ",5,17,79
Michael, Tell me; was it a spoiled little girl with big lips… ,5,17,79
Michael, …or an odd little boy with a cowboy obsession? ,5,17,79
Michael," Really? That’s kind of a big client. [gets up and heads toward Oscar] Hey, Oscar. Woo hoo hoo. Um, how much of a hit is ten percent of our Blue Cross account?",5,17,79
Michael," You didn’t, but… it’ll be fine. It’ll be good.   ",5,17,79
Michael, Sir. I placed a bunch of golden tickets into five separate boxes and some how they all ended up with Blue Cross. How does this happen? ,5,17,79
Michael," OK, I’m going to ask you something and I want you to be honest. What is a pallet?   ",5,17,79
Michael, My golden ticket idea? OK. Why would anyone think that this is my golden ticket idea? There is a one in 13 chance that this could be anybody’s golden ticket idea. [sighs] That… [sighs]  ,5,17,79
Michael," Nobody panic. The good news is… they can’t fire all of us, right? ",5,17,79
Michael," Oscar, you don’t know what the hell you are talking about.",5,17,79
Michael," Alright, then we’re screwed. I am just a net that traps all of your crappy subconscious ideas and adds a little bit of my own childhood memories and whimsy, so – ",5,17,79
Michael, Well you know what Jim? It is not my fault that you bought a house to impress Pam. That is why carnations exist.,5,17,79
Michael," OK, we need a gold ticket idea to get us out of this mess. [Pam raises hand] Yes.",5,17,79
Michael," OK, don’t get that. Please? [Pam gets up to answer her phone]",5,17,79
Michael," [on phone] Hello David. I just got back from my procedure, so–",5,17,79
Michael, [reading from computer] My colonoscopy was an examination of my large colon and the distal part of my small bowel with a camera.,5,17,79
Michael," Well, there is an explanation that involves me not letting it happen and I just don’t… I don’t know.",5,17,79
Michael, I think we might have hired an outside marketing consultant. ,5,17,79
Michael," OK, I think, it might have been an inside consultant. ",5,17,79
Michael," [Dwight walks in] Come on in. Good to see ya, have a seat. I just wanted to congratulate you on that great golden ticket idea.",5,17,79
Michael," [same time as Dwight] No, I don’t think I ever did. That was your idea Dwight. ",5,17,79
Michael," Wait a second, wait a second, I wrote it down in my diary.",5,17,79
Michael, Yes I do. You’ve just never seen it. [reading from diary] March 4th. Dwight came up with the best idea today about golden tickets. ,5,17,79
Michael," OK, you know what? You came up with this idea. I remember you told me that you loved the Willy Wonka movie when you were growing up.",5,17,79
Michael, What are you writing? [Dwight writes in diary],5,17,79
Michael, Would you like to go to lunch with me? Just the two of us? ,5,17,79
Michael, We think a lot alike. Sometimes you will think something and I will say what you’re thinking–,5,17,79
Michael," Oh, OK. Let me just cut to the chase, Dwight. I want you to fall on your sword for me.",5,17,79
Michael," Why do you even want to stay at Dunder Mifflin? I mean what’s the point? You’re cooped up in there all day. You don’t get to do your farming. You’re not dating Angela anymore. It doesn’t matter if you get fired for taking credit for the gold ticket idea. It doesn’t matter. Me on the other hand, I would be lost without this place. You, way too manly.",5,17,79
Michael," I have an idea for a fancy men’s shoe store called Shoe La La. And it’s just men’s shoes for the special occasions in a man’s life, like the day that you get married or the day your wife has a baby, or for just lounging around the house.   ",5,17,79
Michael," May I have your attention please. I have an announcement. Mr. Dwight Schrute and I just returned from a wonderful stroll together and although I probably will never do it again, I had fun. I really had fun with my best friend, Dwight. ",5,17,79
Michael," Yes they are, you just don’t care about the information.   ",5,17,79
Michael, He doesn’t love it that much. Wouldn’t be such a bad thing for him to be fired. ,5,17,79
Michael," I mean, like we were talking about that is why he has come to the conclusion… ",5,17,79
Michael, That’s it. That’s it. You can’t put a price on freedom. ,5,17,79
Michael, That’s why you made the decision. That’s why you made… ,5,17,79
Michael," [seeing David Wallace come into the office] Oh my God. Dwight! Dwight! Get in— what’s it gonna be, what are you gonna do? [Dwight runs into Michael’s office] What’s it gonna be? Are you gonna do this thing for me? Dwight? [David knocks on Michael’s door and opens door] Hey David, how are you? Good to see you. Nice surprise. Dwight and I were just having a very unfortunate conversation. ",5,17,79
Michael," Yes it is, but it had to be done, didn’t it?",5,17,79
Michael," Hey, Dwight, great idea. Dwight, Dwight, great idea. How’d you come up with that idea? ",5,17,79
Michael, Really? How did– how are you inspired?  How did it pop into your head Dwight?,5,17,79
Michael, Give me the details of how that happened.,5,17,79
Michael, There is no movie called Willy Wonka. It’s called Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.,5,17,79
Michael, I can’t… vouch for that. But I do know this. He is a liar. He has taken my idea.,5,17,79
Michael," OK, here’s what happened, David. It was all my idea. You called me and you were really angry at me and I got scared, so I had Dwight take the fall, but now, it turns out that it’s a great idea and Dwight will not confess. Can you believe that? ",5,17,79
Michael," You are? Good ideas, huh? Hey, did you come up with toilet buddy? It’s a net, circular net, that you put inside the toilet to catch all of your change and your wallet from falling into the toilet? Formally known as toilet guard? ",5,17,79
Michael, Toilet sponge. It’s a hollowed out sponge…,5,17,79
Michael," …that is more absorbent, and softer than toilet paper. I have a lot of toilet ideas. ",5,17,79
Michael, They’re not easy. Everybody has to go to the bathroom. ,5,17,79
Michael," Well David, I will be honest with you. I do want the credit without any of the blame.",5,17,79
Michael, When they look back on this day in the history books all that will be remembered is that I had a good idea. And that’s what I am going to write down in my diary. That is what I want you to write down in yours. ,5,17,79
Michael, I want to see it. [Michael gets up to try to see Dwight’s diary],5,17,79
Michael," [standing on tractor trailer with Dwight and Andy, looking down] Okay, we all go together or we go one at a time.",6,1,81
Michael, [entering break room] Who’s getting married?,6,1,81
Michael," If somebody doesn’t tell me, I’m gonna start screaming.",6,1,81
Michael," Oh! Hey, I hired them! Matchmaker! This place is like Spaniard Fly.",6,1,81
Michael, [shaking head disgustedly] Okay… okay. [leaves room]  				,6,1,81
Michael, [approaches Dwight’s desk] You’ll never guess what I know.,6,1,81
Michael,"  I hate, hate, hate being left out. Whether it’s not being picked for a team, or being picked for a team and showing up and realizing the team doesn’t exist. Or that the sport doesn’t exist? I should’ve known. Poopball?  				",6,1,81
Michael," [to Maurie, the Asian intern] Man, I know how you feel. Third wheel. I have been the third wheel so many times in my life. My mom told me something once that made me feel a lot better. She said “The third wheel is what makes it a tricycle.”",6,1,81
Michael, I’m talking about your group date with Megan and Eric.,6,1,81
Michael, [confused] Stanley was on your group date?,6,1,81
Michael, [laughs] Does anybody else know about this?,6,1,81
Michael," [laughs, looks to camera excitedly]  				",6,1,81
Michael," There he goes. There he goes. [Stanley gets up from his desk, walks into kitchen area]",6,1,81
Michael," So, what is the scuttlebutt? Anybody hear anything?",6,1,81
Michael, Nothing? Well I got a little somethin’ somethin’. I don’t know if I should say… ,6,1,81
Michael," Well apparently, he and his wife were out dancing at a club for young people.",6,1,81
Michael," [starts to speak, says nothing, walks away]  				",6,1,81
Michael," [entering break room, to Maurie] You stupid son of a bitch. You set me up.",6,1,81
Michael, [fumbling for words] Mmm… okay. Uhh… hmm… okay. Never mind. Carry on.  				,6,1,81
Michael," [approaching Kelly’s desk, whispering] Stanley is having an affir.",6,1,81
Michael,"  I am very happy right now. Thrilled perhaps, to be part of the office, to be part of the conversation. When you have somebody’s attenton, and their eyes are lighting up because they are very interested in what you have to say, [Michael is seen whispering to Jim, then Pam] that is a great feeling, and I experienced that firsthand today. It is wonderful to be the center of attention.  				",6,1,81
Michael," [motioning to pad of paper with hangman game, spelling out  “S_an_ey is chea_in_ _n _eri] That and that are the same letter.",6,1,81
Michael," No… no. He’s holding a pencil. He could be doing a crossword puzzle with that pencil. What’s that letter, right there? Same letter here and here. What haven’t you guessed?",6,1,81
Michael," T! Yes! Yes! That is a “T”, and there’s another one right there. Just sound that out. You’re almost there.  				",6,1,81
Michael," [opening blinds as Stanley walks past] Hey, Stanley! Where you goin’, big guy? Up to no good?",6,1,81
Michael," No, no, no, no. I just had a quick question for you. I’m casting a movie and I’m looking for a woman who can dance, beautiful woman. Do you know anybody?",6,1,81
Michael, Pays five million dollars. Nudity required.,6,1,81
Michael," [giddy, whispering] Did you hear Stanley’s having an affair?",6,1,81
Michael," Oh, okay, I get it. You feel out of the loop, and you feel sorry for yourself, and it’s really sad because everybody thinks you’re a loser… ",6,1,81
Michael," [stares at Jim silently, then walks away]  				",6,1,81
Michael," [in parking lot, blocking path of Stanley’s car] Stop. Hold up, hold up, hold up! No, no, no. Time to stop being polite and get real. [Stanley honks horn repeatedly] Stanley, are you having an affair?",6,1,81
Michael," So It’s not true. Okay, well… ahhh, those interns, they told me they saw you at a club, and they all said it was you, it was clearly just… racial profiling gossip.",6,1,81
Michael," Oh my God! Wait a second, do people often say they’re going on sales calls and then go someplace else? ‘Cause that’s not cool.",6,1,81
Michael, [muttering] I’m not saying… a damn thing.,6,1,81
Michael," [entering kitchen area] Oh, that smells good.",6,1,81
Michael, Did you hear about Angela? That’s pretty weird.,6,1,81
Michael," Well, the fact that she is apparently dating an 81-year-old billionaire. Owns a Quizno’s on the turnpike.",6,1,81
Michael, Uh huh. [gestures to Kevin to keep it quiet] Alright?  				,6,1,81
Michael,"  How do you un-tell something? You can’t. You can’t put words back in your mouth. What you can do is spread false gossip so that people think that everything that’s been said is untrue, including “Stanley is having an affair.” It’s like the end of Spartacus. I’ve seen that movie half a dozen times, and I still don’t know who the real Spartacus is, and that is what makes that movie a classic whodunit.  				",6,1,81
Michael," Nothing can be done, we just have to tell everybody and hope for the best I guess.  				",6,1,81
Michael," [to Kelly] I’m worried about Erin, because she’s not a very good worker. I don’t know how long she’s gonna last here.",6,1,81
Michael, [whispering to Meredith] Did you hear Pam is pregnant?,6,1,81
Michael," [whispering] Guys, guys… you can’t believe everything you hear. Like Stanley, having an affair? That is crazy! It’s just… there’s no stalking it. It’s a weird day for false facts. Let it go.",6,1,81
Michael," [with everyone assembled in conference room] Okay everybody, big day. Last day for our interns, a lot of other stuff… who knows what to believe? Dwight, the honors.",6,1,81
Michael," [entering conference room] Yeah, yeah… you know what? Let’s discredit these rumors.",6,1,81
Michael," That’s not important, Jim, I just think we shouldn’t listen to any of that crap.",6,1,81
Michael," [to everyone, in conference room] Okay, I made it all up.",6,1,81
Michael," But guys, I’m a victim here too, okay? People here have been saying that I’m a J. Crew model.",6,1,81
Michael," Jim? No, no. I spread the rumor that somebody here was a J. Crew model, and I was referring to myself.",6,1,81
Michael," Because a lot of people think that models, even though they’re very attractive, are somewhat vapid. It’s set our industry back quite a bit.",6,1,81
Michael," Okay, okay… here’s the thing. There was one true rumor out there today. I didn’t want everybody to know what it was. So all of you are off the hook, except for this one person.",6,1,81
Michael," [sighs] The one true rumor, and this is going to ruin this person’s life, is that… ",6,1,81
Michael," Alright, alright… you know, this is not the truth, and you can’t fall on the sword this way. The real thing is that Stanley Hudson had an affair.",6,1,81
Michael, Look at that! [grabs sonogram from Pam] That is the inside of your vagina! [Jim takes sonogram from Michael]  				,6,1,81
Michael, [to Jim and Pam] How long have you known about the pregnancy?,6,1,81
Michael," Oh, oh… yeah, a long time ago, just to make sure she was out of town. Oh… oh God.",6,1,81
Michael," No, I have to take it, or it’ll seem suspicious.",6,1,81
Michael," Yes, I can. I am going to tell her that I need to redecorate my condo, and I need her help. We will haggle about money, and then I will back down, and then I won’t talk to her until this whole Cynthia thing has blown over.",6,1,81
Michael," [picking up phone] Hey, what up, Cynthia? [lowers phone, looking terrified]",6,1,81
Michael," Well, it turns out that Teri was already suspicious, because she had caught Stanley and Cynthia a few months ago. So Stanley promised that he would stop, and he did, end of story. Well, not exactly. [camera pans down from Michael’s office window to parking lot below, Stanley is seen destroying Michael’s Sebring with a crowbar] Uhh, Cynthia kept calling him, she would not stop calling him, and she was in love with him. Oh, and get this. Cynthia, also married. So… you can’t stop love, I guess [Jim is seen displaying fetus picture on his desk as Pam smiles] and quite frankly, I don’t think you should ever try.  				",6,1,81
Michael,"   Yes, Oscar come on in.  Close the door if you would.  Thank you, thanks so much for talking to me.  ",6,2,82
Michael,"   Yeah, it’s routine.  I’m just a little bit scared.  ",6,2,82
Michael,"   In your experience, what should I be expecting in terms of sensation or emotions? [Oscar looks irritated and frustrated] Is there anything I can do to make it more pleasurable for me or for Dr. Shaundry?  ",6,2,82
Michael,"   My main concern, should I have a safe word?",6,2,82
Michael,"   Abso… you know what? I’ll do you one better, Sunday, Sunday night.",6,2,82
Michael,"   Ho, Hol, hold on big guy, I’m gonna put it in the mail Sunday night and you’ll get it Weds.",6,2,82
Michael,"   Oh right, this thing. I remember now.  [whispers to Jim]  What’s this about?",6,2,82
Michael,   It’s okay with me but he’s gonna want me in there.,6,2,82
Michael,"   Alright, do you mind if it sit this out?  I have so much work to do, I feel like I’m gonna blow my brains out.",6,2,82
Michael,"   Am I worried that Jim and David are having a meeting without me?  No, because we are the Three Amigos.  And once in awhile one of the Amigos will go off… to the bathroom… while the other two have a secret meeting.  [shrugs]  				",6,2,82
Michael,"   Hey, what do you think he and David are talking about? What do you… ",6,2,82
Michael,"   Well, you said good luck to Jim as he walked in.",6,2,82
Michael,"   If you are lying to me right now Pam, your baby is gonna come out a liar.  That’s how it works.  They inherit things through the breast milk.",6,2,82
Michael,   I just don’t want you to lie to me.  I don’t want you to ever lie to me.  Have I ever lied to you?  ,6,2,82
Michael,"   [walks into conference room on his cell phone, interrupting David and Jim] Uh huh, well if he doesn’t like it you can tell that SOB that he is fired.  Sorry, I’m going into a meeting right now.  I will… I love you too.  Bye.",6,2,82
Michael,"    Do not mind!  Yes, I do!  No, I don’t.  Yes, I do!  No, I don’t mind.  Catch you guys on the flippity flop.  Oh this… call waiting.  [answers his phone] Yeah, uh huh,  well you tell the Mayor he just lost six votes.    				",6,2,82
Michael,"   No, I think they’re talking about me.",6,2,82
Michael,"   What is Jim telling him?  That I can’t handle this job?  That ‘s bull crap.  That is bull crap.  Although, it has been chaotic lately.  Corporate shut down the Buffalo branch which left us to absorb all of their clients.  I will tell you there has been work everyday.  Had to come in on a Saturday. To retrieve… I left my cell phone here.    				",6,2,82
Michael,   [staring into the conference room] How are your sales doin’?  ,6,2,82
Michael,"   Shhh, I’m just trying to figure out what’s going on in that room, okay?    				",6,2,82
Michael,   Wallace had to show up on the one four month period that I’m completely overwhelmed.    				,6,2,82
Michael,"   You know when they say it’s so crazy it just might work?  Well, I don’t believe that.  I say go for the air-tight plan and that is why I am having Andy wheel me into the conference room inside a makeshift cheese cart.  It is just elegant.    				",6,2,82
Michael,"   [crawls out of the cheese cart unseen] Hey, hey, you must have walked right past me.  How you doin’?  ",6,2,82
Michael,"   Well I would say that my greatest talent is being the best man, woman, or child, to have ever run this branch, ever.",6,2,82
Michael,   [looks at Jim]   Permission to speak on the record?,6,2,82
Michael,"   Jim is like Big Bird.  He is tall and yellow and very nice.  But would I put him in charge?  No, I don’t think so.  Because Big Bird doesn’t make the tough decisions.  I… If I was gonna put someone in charge, I would put Burt in charge or I would put one of the real grown-ups in charge, like Maria or Gordon, maybe.  ",6,2,82
Michael,"   Very much, Jim is my best friend. But it’s his performance report… right here.  Now this was written by Toby, who we all know is extremely reliable.    				",6,2,82
Michael,"  It’s not very well written, but you get the gist.  ",6,2,82
Michael,   I can just continue to run it myself.  ,6,2,82
Michael,"   Wow.  Ummm, well I’d have to talk to my mother and my guy at H and R Block.  ",6,2,82
Michael,"  [after talking to David, Jim looks dejected] I can’t help but feel partially responsible.   				",6,2,82
Michael,   [shakes jelly beans] Little pick me up?  [Jim accepts] Oh those are the best.  Little sugar rush.  ,6,2,82
Michael,   Well we did talk about how handsome you are.  ,6,2,82
Michael,"   Oh what a week, God.  We said… I know there were certain things we said… ",6,2,82
Michael,"   Hmmm, that’s weird, that’s weird… it’s kinda weirding me out.  Did you know that Lincoln’s secretary was named Kennedy.  ",6,2,82
Michael,"   Tell you what, when you leave this office I am going to call Wallace and I am going to tell him that you should get that promotion.  ",6,2,82
Michael,"   Hey David, this is Michael Scott.  [Jim pushes speaker phone button]  Michael Scott here.  ",6,2,82
Michael,   Just wanted to talk to you about  Jim Halpert.  I understand that he did not receive the promotion.  And I wanted to see what I could do to nudge you in the right direction.  ,6,2,82
Michael,"   Wha… here’s the thing, Jim is the best man for this job, I think you should give it to him.  ",6,2,82
Michael,"   Well, nnnn, that… that was an anomaly.  That file had been falsified.  Toby Flenderson is doing drugs.  ",6,2,82
Michael,"   Hey, hey Jim, it would make me feel really good right now if you would just punch me in the face.  Alright,  Just do it.",6,2,82
Michael,"   I never recommended you because I didn’t want to lose you and I didn’t want to lose Pam, [starts to choke up] and now I don’t wanna lose the baby.  ",6,2,82
Michael,   Kind of in the middle of something here.  ,6,2,82
Michael,"   I, yeah… no, I’ll tell him myself.  Let’s both.    				",6,2,82
Michael,"   Oh, oh, well here he is right now.  [Michael knocks on desk]  Come in.  [Makes sound effects for door opening and footsteps and points to Jim to answer]  ",6,2,82
Michael,   Well just as long as it means Jim becomes a manager.,6,2,82
Michael,"   I like that, so manager and co-manager.  ",6,2,82
Michael,   Well that might be a little confusing for people because they know me as manager.  ,6,2,82
Michael,"   Okay everybody, I have an announcement to make… whoa do you have an announcement?  ",6,2,82
Michael,"   Everybody, David Wallace and I have talked and we have decided to promote Jim to the position of co-manager.  ",6,2,82
Michael,"   Of your butt, and your butt, and your butt, all of the Scranton branch butts.",6,2,82
Michael,"   What’s happening to me?  I am also being promoted to co-manager, we will be co-managers together.  Jim Halpert, welcome.",6,2,82
Michael," Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.  				",6,3,83
Michael," Everyone, now would be a good time to freshen up, because I’d like everyone to meet in the conference room in five minutes. And I suggest that you bring a snack, because we may be in there for a while.",6,3,83
Michael," Mmm, sure, but could I first talk to you in my office?",6,3,83
Michael," No, I don’t think they are. I think the meetings are very important. ",6,3,83
Michael," N– well, to be fair, Jim… James… Jimothy… To be fair, Jimothy, the– ah, that sounds weird. Are you okay with being called Jim?",6,3,83
Michael," Alright. Jim, to be fair, the conversation wasn’t about planets… ",6,3,83
Michael," At first, we were talking about introducing a line of toilet paper. And what part of the human body does one use toilet paper upon? So you draw a line from there to the other planets, and I think by the end, we all learned a little bit about how small we are.",6,3,83
Michael," Because it’s a big universe, and we’re all just little, tiny specks of dust. ",6,3,83
Michael," You know what eats a large amount of the day are naps. You go to sleep, it’s light out, you wake up, it’s dark. That’s the whole day. Where did that day go? I have no idea.",6,3,83
Michael," Yeah, just focus-grouping a product expansion idea to these folks. Got one of each.",6,3,83
Michael," Stanley, you don’t need to answer that.",6,3,83
Michael," Oh, hey, everybody, I think that Jim has gone insane, because he thinks that my office is a conference room.",6,3,83
Michael," Listen, Jim, no offense, but when push comes to shove, what I want is more important that what you want.",6,3,83
Michael, What do you guys think? [all start talking at the same time] ,6,3,83
Michael," No, no, no, you don’t need to go anywhere. Anything that Jim has to say to me, he can say in front of these types of people. ",6,3,83
Michael," It is one thing, me giving you the co-manager title. It is another thing, you bossing me around. ",6,3,83
Michael," No, no, no. No, we will not call David Wallace. [Michael pulls out his cell phone] I will call David Wallace.",6,3,83
Michael, Or David Wallace will call us on line two. Why don’t we just–,6,3,83
Michael," Hey David, this is Michael, senior co-manager. ",6,3,83
Michael," Got it, Dave. Sounds like your classice big-picture decision. ",6,3,83
Michael, I thought maybe we could talk after this is over. ,6,3,83
Michael," Talk to you later– [Jim hangs up] Okay, you didn’t let me say good-bye. [sighs, and claps hands once] Alright, I am looking forward to this. ",6,3,83
Michael," I hate the fact that we have to do this together. I think we work better separately. When I am irritated and I look at you, I don’t see you anymore. ",6,3,83
Michael, All I can see is how big and gross the pores on your nose are.,6,3,83
Michael," You know, there’s no easy way to do this. I say we add 1.5% to their paychecks and don’t say anything about it.",6,3,83
Michael," No, we can do it during the day. It doesn’t have to be that dramatic, Jim.",6,3,83
Michael," Jim, don’t take this the wrong way. Are you gonna take this the wrong way?",6,3,83
Michael, Sometimes the smartest people don’t think at all.,6,3,83
Michael, [in nerdy voice] Con– you look like a nerd.,6,3,83
Michael, Pro– you get to share your pros and cons list with the other nerds.,6,3,83
Michael," Con– you unzip your pants, and you find that there’s a calculator down there.  				",6,3,83
Michael," Oh, my God! Are you gonna make another pro and con list? I’m gonna kill myself. ",6,3,83
Michael," No! I could not do that, Jim. I can see it in your crusty little eyes that you are going to make everything perfect. If I can just think this through, if I could just think it exactly right, I can make this perfect, and then I can go down every avenue, and every avenue off of that avenue, and then another avenue. ",6,3,83
Michael," Okay. Well, why don’t you tell me what those are, Jim? Why don’t you enliven me?",6,3,83
Michael," Okay, here’s a tough decision for you. You suck! You suck! Is that clear enough for you?!",6,3,83
Michael," Okay, Skippy, here we go. Why don’t you run yourself out there and tell them? [laughs] You call it.",6,3,83
Michael, [to the camera] This had better be terrible. ,6,3,83
Michael," That was good! That was good! Okay, all right. Well, we all know it’s hard to be a boss, right? You know what? Look around you. These are your best friends. These are the people who will open their hearts to you. They all have heart-ons for you [someone growns in disgust], and that is a gift. So in terms of gifts, we should be giving each other gifts. Angela, yes, lend Oscar a cup of sugar. This–",6,3,83
Michael," Alright! Let me get this clear! Does everybody want a raise? [all say yes] Alright, everyone wants a raise, so what we’re going to do is go into here, and we will not come out until we do. ",6,3,83
Michael," Mm-hmm. Piece of cake. Ryan, obviously the best. ",6,3,83
Michael, Alright! Who to pick? [walking around the table] Who to pick? ,6,3,83
Michael," [leaving his office, hurrying to Jim’s office]  ",6,3,83
Michael," Usually a ten, but I’m feeling like a zero. ",6,3,83
Michael," Um, nothing. I just… I used to have to do this part alone, and it was the worst. I have something I would like to give you. [leaves office]  ",6,3,83
Michael, [someone knocks] Just pretend we’re not here.  				,6,3,83
Michael, [standing next to a car decorated for leaving a wedding] What do you think? I spent all morning on it.,6,4,84
Michael, It’s just a really important day for me.,6,4,84
Michael, Yes she does. Yes she does. We’re all gonna go and we’re gonna have a good time. [hugs Angela],6,4,84
Michael," And, hey, don’t embarrass me when we go to Niagara.",6,4,84
Michael, Don’t. Don’t. Don’t. You stole my joke. Don’t steal my joke.,6,4,84
Michael," No. No. No. Please, please. Dwight, that’s my joke.",6,4,84
Michael," This is what I’m talking about. When we leave here and go up to Niagara Falls we are representing Dunder Mifflin, everyone. This is a very important wedding for the branch. The most important wedding until I get married. So, I want you all on your best behavior or so help me, God. So… I will see you up there in Viagra Falls!  				",6,4,84
Michael, Pam and Jim’s wedding will be the single best pick up destination in the history of the universe.  				,6,4,84
Michael," [in car, Michael driving] Oh! God! Wow! Oh. I was asleep.",6,4,84
Michael," Oh, very thoughtful. A little mix to set the mood. Delightful. Pop that in.",6,4,84
Michael, Are you serious? You want me to play that for a woman coming to my room?,6,4,84
Michael, I don’t have a reservation but I want a room in the Halpert-Beesly block of rooms.,6,4,84
Michael," Dwight. Dwight, Dwight. I need to stay in your room.",6,4,84
Michael, Um… no. And you know what? I would say yes but you can’t. And I’ll tell you why.,6,4,84
Michael," If I have a woman up there and things are getting amorous, she’s going to get turned off if she looks in he bathroom and sees you brushing your teeth with butter and clay.",6,4,84
Michael, Ok. ‘Oooh. You must pass the dungeon wisdom test.’,6,4,84
Michael," When Mary was denied a room at the inn… Jesus was born. When Michael was denied a room at the inn, we don’t know what happens because that story hasn’t been told yet.  				",6,4,84
Michael, Hey. Stanley? Can I stay in your room tonight?,6,4,84
Michael," I’m not a physics major, Stanley. I’m just saying be careful. Hey, guys. Hey. Could I stay in your room tonight?",6,4,84
Michael," You are going to be slepping by yourself for the rest of your life, so you just get used to it.  				",6,4,84
Michael," Yeah, yeah, yeah. She’s very conservative. So, mum’s the word.",6,4,84
Michael, Who’s doing a toast? I would like to go third. Sort of bat clean up and–,6,4,84
Michael," [talking quietly, trying not to move his lips]That is seriously going to impeed my ability to hook up with your female relatives.",6,4,84
Michael," What am I supposed to do with that, Dwight?",6,4,84
Michael," They have hilarious material and they are going to totally deliver it wrong. I would kill with the brother stuff. It should be me… up there. It should be me and Pete, not Pete and Tom.  				",6,4,84
Michael," That’s not appropriate. Hello. Hi, everybody. I promised I wasn’t gonna make a toast and I’m not going to. Just going to do a little free standing comedy and if at the end everybody wants to raise their glasses to Pam and Jim, then so be it. Hey, what is the deal with the Smart Car? How smart is that? Those things are tiny. Can you even drive them in traffic? ‘I’m so smart. E=mc… squared. I drive a Smart Car.’ That’s not smart in my book. The real smart car is Kitt from Knight Rider.",6,4,84
Michael, That’s a car that can talk. Can Smart Car talk? Nope.,6,4,84
Michael," That’s not smart. And also, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. [no one is laughing]",6,4,84
Michael, And… you… everybody can laugh. It doesn’t have to just be the idiots. Everybody can laugh.,6,4,84
Michael," [clears throat] Ok. Ok. Hey. What I think Jim is trying to say is that… they had an accident and you know what? These two people, they’re living together, they’re having lots of consentual sex–",6,4,84
Michael," Yes. Yes they were living together. Yes and you know what? You can’t expect them to be careful every time. Because, frankly, it’s just a different sensation.",6,4,84
Michael," When you c– well? Am I wrong? They say it’s not different, but it’s a different sensation.",6,4,84
Michael, When you use something to block– I think everybody knows what I am talking about. It’s not necessarily different for the woman–,6,4,84
Michael," Alright. My point is I said what I wanted to say and Mema, I hope you heard every word.",6,4,84
Michael, That was a little touch and go at first but I think we saved it.,6,4,84
Michael," I know. I can’t believe it was you, either. I actually think it takes a lot of pressure off of me.",6,4,84
Michael," Can you believe it? He screwed up, not me.",6,4,84
Michael, Yes. Yep. One in the same. May I?  				,6,4,84
Michael," I am actually great with old women. In fact, for the longest time, my best friend was my grandma… and then she met Harriet and now she thinks she’s better than everybody.  				",6,4,84
Michael," Oh. Ok. Well… hook you up, there. [turns off tv]",6,4,84
Michael," Oh. Isn’t he terrible? May I? Here’s the thing. Umm… Mema, I think you just need to chill out about this whole Pam getting pregnant thing. It’s not 1890 anymore. It’s modern day. And women have sex before marriage and I think we need to celebrate that. And I know in your day she would be considered a whore but, now, women go out and they have sex and they get wild and they take their tops off and they have pictures taken of them and we need to encouage them. That’s part of life.",6,4,84
Michael," They’re gonna name the baby after you, you know. They’re gonna call it Mema.",6,4,84
Michael," Yes, and if it’s a boy they will call it Sylvio.  				",6,4,84
Michael," Looks like you’re going to a fish fry, Dwight.",6,4,84
Michael," Ok. [Dwight howls] That’s not appropriate. [Dwight continues howling] Uncool. Uncool, Dwight. [they both howl] Ok. Ok. Come on. Let’s go. [both howl as they exit]  				",6,4,84
Michael," Dwight, Dwight. Shut up about the farm. It’s not relatable. Nobody owns a farm.",6,4,84
Michael," [talking to an attractive woman] Toy Story, Finding Nemo, Up. I ball the entire time. I can not watch Pixar.",6,4,84
Michael," Oh, my God. Twins. I’m sorry. You understand. Nice to meet you.  				",6,4,84
Michael," [over phone]  Is that Pam?  Hey, have her come out!  Have her come out!  It would be like Coyote Ugly.  ",6,4,84
Michael, Mmm!  It’s after midnight. [points at Jim],6,4,84
Michael, Oh my God.  You’re not going to be able to talk back.,6,4,84
Michael,"  She’ll be sitting home saying, “Jim… take the baby to the zoo cause I want to sit at home and eat bon-bons.”  [Dwight laughs] “And… and clip my toenails.”",6,4,84
Michael," [folding his pants on top of the ice machine, man walks in with ice bucket] Why don’t you take a picture.  It’ll last longer.  God.  Can’t I get a little privacy?   				",6,4,84
Michael," [passes Isabel] Hey, good morning.  [to Dwight] It’s about damn time.  I haven’t gone to the bathroom in a day and a half.  [walks into hotel room]  Oh my God, Dwight.  This room is a pit.",6,4,84
Michael,  [watching Dwight eat breakfast] How can you eat like that?,6,4,84
Michael,"  Yeah, I’m hungry, but I’m not going to make a pig out of myself.",6,4,84
Michael,  She was cute.  You know?  She was hot.  She was very hot.  She made love like a tiger.,6,4,84
Michael, Wait a second.  You’re not into her?  Are you kidding me?  ,6,4,84
Michael,  She’s Pam’s best friend.  You guys could double date.  Swap maybe?,6,4,84
Michael,  She’s– okay.  Do you know how hard it is to be a hygienist?  You have to take x-rays.  You have to scrape the plaque off of people’s teeth.  You have to tell kids when to spit and make sure they’re not scared when the dentist comes in.  It– it–,6,4,84
Michael,  [stands up and walks away]  I already have my European girlfriend.    				,6,4,84
Michael," Oh, here we go.  They asked for cash, but you know… I give them cash every week, so– how much cash does a person need?  I have taken it upon myself to do something a little more special.  I have painted a portrait of the two of them from memory.  [holds up painting]  And I have another one of them in the nude.  But that one is for me.    				",6,4,84
Michael," [to Isabel] Hey, hey… He’s not sitting with me either.  Where are you sitting?  You need a seat buddy?",6,4,84
Michael," Oh, I wish I was a bridesmaid.  Where am I gonna go?  				",6,4,84
Michael,  [to Pam’s mom] Hey.  Hi.  Do you–would you have a snack in your purse?  You’re a mom.  I just figured you might have–,6,4,84
Michael, Oh!  Eww… apricot.  Do you have any of the Very Berry or Ocean Splash or–,6,4,84
Michael,  I’m sorry. [puts food in his mouth] Ugh.  Apricot.  Made of real apes.    				,6,4,84
Michael,"  I came here hoping to meet somebody.  You know, as you do at weddings.  End up going to sleep by the vending machine.  It was loud, but it was warm.",6,4,84
Michael, And… and the love of my life is dating somebody else.  ,6,4,84
Michael,  I’m thinking about having my sperm frozen.,6,4,84
Michael," Oh, wow.  That sounds hilarious.  I do actually. [pulls whoopee cushion out of pocket and hands it to them]  There you go.  Use it in good health.  ",6,4,84
Michael,  [walks up] Yes! Yes!  I have so much joy…  in my heart… right now.  How do I look?  ,6,4,84
Michael," Hey Pam, did you see this? It was on You Tube.",6,4,84
Michael," Yes. So, it all starts with a handshake.  But you can’t just go right to the selling, you need “small talk.”  What topics can you use for small talk?",6,5,85
Michael," Yeah! That’s good! Come on up! Meredith, come up here. Let’s do a little something. So Meredith and I have just started conversing and I will say, “So Meredith, how was your weekend, what did you do?”",6,5,85
Michael," Okay, okay. God. What you people don’t know about business, I could fill a book with.",6,5,85
Michael," [into mini recorder] The fundamentals of business by Michael Scott. Over one billion sold. More than the Bible, I’m not surprised. Chapter one. The businessman…   				",6,5,85
Michael," Oh hi. I’m sorry, just a sec. [whispers] Erin, you’re supposed to be the gatekeeper, do you have any idea how valuable my time is?",6,5,85
Michael, Do you know how creative space works? Okay I just cancelled my afternoon.,6,5,85
Michael, Push free play til tomorrow morning. [to Grotti] Hi. Sorry. Crazy day. You’re seeing how the sausage gets made. ,6,5,85
Michael, Come in the conference room and I will show you a finished sausage.  				,6,5,85
Michael," There is nothing more insulting to a great salesman, than having to listen to a bad salesman. It’s like a great basketball player having to listen to a bad basketball player.  				",6,5,85
Michael," Oh yup. Yeah, definitely. All that paper burning up.",6,5,85
Michael," [Grotti knocks over coat stand grabbing his overcoat] Oh, great.",6,5,85
Michael," Nothing, other than once again, I am just thankful that I am a paper salesman.",6,5,85
Michael," Wait, when did we start talking about the mob? The guy was trying to sell me insurance.",6,5,85
Michael," I think, he just seemed like he was just trying to sell me insurance.",6,5,85
Michael, He did talk about a fire in the warehouse…  and he also vaguely threatened me with testicular cancer.,6,5,85
Michael," [over chatter] Hey, hey hey, calm down. Calm down. Calm down.  Ryan, you lived in New York, what do you think?",6,5,85
Michael, Okay too many different words coming at me from too many different sentences.,6,5,85
Michael, I’m not gonna lock my door.  [door closes. Then clicks locked]  				,6,5,85
Michael, [reads email] “I feel that you will regret missing this great opportunity to be in business.”  ,6,5,85
Michael," Yeah. What are my options here? Do I just ignore it, or?",6,5,85
Michael," All right. I will meet with him, but I’m not going alone.",6,5,85
Michael," [Andy dressed as a mechanic, Cornell hat on] What are you wearing? Who’s Pat?",6,5,85
Michael, [Andy is playing with the tire iron] Take that thing off the table! Please!,6,5,85
Michael," Guys, guys. Cool it. There he is, there he is.  				",6,5,85
Michael,  Mr. Grotti we meet again. These are my associates.,6,5,85
Michael," Shh. I will have the spaghetti, with a side salad. ",6,5,85
Michael," If the salad is on top, I send it back.  				",6,5,85
Michael, I don’t think our company actually needs any more insurance. So I am out.,6,5,85
Michael," No, no no, no. Come on. I’m sorry, we’re having our salad.",6,5,85
Michael, It’s just the cost of a cup of coffee an hour.,6,5,85
Michael," It wasn’t easy. I had to tell the hotel it was a medical emergency. I chose massive coronary, cause you told me that your Dad had a bad heart. Listen man, I, I got a problem, I think I’m in trouble with the mob. Or a major insurance carrier. ",6,5,85
Michael," Yeah, I know and you usually can get out of stuff like this, so I’m turning to you my friend.",6,5,85
Michael," What? Wait, I didn’t hear a thing you just said.",6,5,85
Michael," No! God! I missed, I missed the important part again!",6,5,85
Michael," No, Jim please, repeat what you’re saying! I can’t understand you!",6,5,85
Michael," Hey uh, question for you. I recently purchased some insurance that I can’t afford given my present salary. Is there anything accounting-wise I can do to sort of make it all go away?",6,5,85
Michael, Oh no. Um. What about this Cash For Clunkers thing?,6,5,85
Michael," All right. Well, it was a thought. Thanks.  				",6,5,85
Michael, No. He’s not. He’s just good. Nothing sticks to him. You still don’t understand how this works.,6,5,85
Michael, But Grotti acts like he’s mafia though.,6,5,85
Michael," If there is one thing I hate more than the mafia it is a liar. I wish the mafia would go out and kill all the liars. Bury them in my yard. And I wouldn’t tell the cops a thing. Not that I would be lying per se. But I would just get really quiet, all of a sudden.  				",6,5,85
Michael, Oh really? Is that supposed to scare me?,6,5,85
Michael, Well you thought wrong. Because I am not pleased. I’m actually kind of PO’d.,6,5,85
Michael," I think you know exactly why, because you were trying to scare me into buying insurance.",6,5,85
Michael, I think you knew exactly what you were doing. And frankly I think you were being a total and utter jerk.,6,5,85
Michael, And I’m not gonna buy your stupid insurance.,6,5,85
Michael," How about that? The only person that actually needs insurance is you, if you show your face around here again, got it?",6,5,85
Michael, What a tool. [Dwight and Andy exchange looks] What?,6,5,85
Michael, Oh man. I should be mad at you guys. But I’m not.  				,6,5,85
Michael," So I looked him in the eye and I said, “Not today Grotti, Not today. And not tomorrow, and not the next day. Or the day after that. And you can tell all your friends that if I see them, then they’re already dead.” I said something like that. ",6,5,85
Michael," Not from the kitchen. Stop and Shop. If it’s not Stop and Shop, I send it back. ",6,5,85
Michael, Large. If it’s a medium I send it back. If it’s an extra large I send it back.,6,5,85
Michael," Is there someone there? Who is there? I hear voices, is somebody there?",6,6,86
Michael, Is someone there? I can’t see you because I’m blind.,6,6,86
Michael," They’re back? Oh! Oh! Oh, Pam! [reaching out with hands at chest level]",6,6,86
Michael," Oh, I haven’t see you since my accident that I had when I fell- I fell into the pool of acid, eyes first. Blind guy.  				",6,6,86
Michael, Blind-guy McSqueezy. How do I describe it? It is a character I’ve been workshopping whose lack of vision gets him into all sorts of trouble. The women in my improve class absolutely hate him. [groans]  				,6,6,86
Michael," [behind Pam, acting out blind-guy, groaning]",6,6,86
Michael," Pam’s mom, Helene. Remember from your wedding?",6,6,86
Michael, And the seats go all the way down. All the way down.,6,6,86
Michael," Okay, good, a pact. A pact. Although I may have to break it tonight when Helene and I tell Pam over dinner. You alright?",6,6,86
Michael," I think you’re underestimating Pam. I think more than anything, she wants me to be happy.",6,6,86
Michael," Okay, I have a good thing with the mom-",6,6,86
Michael," I di- alright, I’ll take surface streets, its- the last thing in the world I would want to do is upset Pam.",6,6,86
Michael, Can you change my dinner reservations from four people to two?,6,6,86
Michael, That is amazing. I feel like a real Puerto Rican.,6,6,86
Michael," Erin, look. [holds up parrot rum bottle]",6,6,86
Michael, I was probably going to break up with her anyway.,6,6,86
Michael," Pam, it is very complicated. There are a lot of moving parts here. ",6,6,86
Michael," Part of the problem is, she is the mother of a close friend of mine.",6,6,86
Michael," That could have gone one of two ways, but I never expected her to get upset.  				",6,6,86
Michael," I’m sleeping with Pam’s mom. Sometimes, dinner.",6,6,86
Michael,"  [in the conference room leading a meeting] Due to a certain recent incident, corporate has asked all the branches to come up with ideas as to how we can better communicate with our communities.",6,6,86
Michael,"  That was a hit job.  If you read the Dunder Mifflin press release it clearly states that they had absolutely nothing to do with that particular cancer cluster.  So if there is a lesson to be learned here and I’m not sure that there is, it is that in order to help our communities, we need to put other people’s needs ahead of our own.  ",6,6,86
Michael,"  Who wants to help the world one step at a time?  [Dwight raises his hand] Alright, good.  ",6,6,86
Michael,"  Okay, I’m out of here, [pretends to leave] see you later guys… ",6,6,86
Michael,"  Ok, oh no here’s an idea… conservation… ",6,6,86
Michael,  Anybody else?  Who else has an idea?  ,6,6,86
Michael,  [Michael leaves to answer his phone] Can you hold down the fort?   [on phone] Hey boo!,6,6,86
Michael,  [on phone] What’s it… why are you crying?  ,6,6,86
Michael,"  [on phone] No, no, no, I’ll talk to her.  I will… No… nobody talks to my baby that way… uh ah… yeah, I’ll let you know how it goes.  Alright, by pickle.  ",6,6,86
Michael,"  [hangs up phone and walks back into conference room] Pamela Morgan Beesly, you need to apologize to your mother right now.  ",6,6,86
Michael,  For trying to find happiness in the arms of a lover?  ,6,6,86
Michael,"  Shut up Oscar.  Hey, alright, you know what, clearly I’m outnumbered here, but can I just say one thing, please?  What is so wrong about me?  I’m caring, I’m generous, I’m sensual.  Is it really so horrible that I could possibly go out and find happiness.  ",6,6,86
Michael,  Let’s get back to the matter at hand.  ,6,6,86
Michael,"  I don’t like the tone here… this is a place of business, you are to listen to others, you are to give others respect, and you are to keep your personal issues out of it.",6,6,86
Michael,"  Do not talk to me that way!  I am your boss and I may someday be your father, so get out.",6,6,86
Michael,"  I hope that you are willing to die in this office, because I am… ",6,6,86
Michael,"  [walks into Toby’s office] Hey Toby, could I talk to you for a minute?",6,6,86
Michael,"  Um, I just wanted to apologize for taking that tone with you earlier that was… uncalled for, I’m sorry.  ",6,6,86
Michael,"  This is gonna sound weird, but I think I may be the victim of a hostile work environment with this whole Pam situation.",6,6,86
Michael,  She brought it into the work place so I feel like it has to be dealt with here.,6,6,86
Michael,"  [hugs Toby, who smiles big] You’re a good, good guy.",6,6,86
Michael,  I don’t… um… I can’t hear your conversation.  ,6,6,86
Michael,"  Yeah, yeah, yeah-okay… you’re a jackass.  [to Pam]  Hey, hey, you know what?  You’re just as stubborn as your mother, when you don’t wanna do something you just don’t do it.  ",6,6,86
Michael,"  You were right Jim, shoulda listened to you, should never have told her.  ",6,6,86
Michael," [Pam storms into break room] Okay, do you want me to stop seeing your mom?  Is that how we’re gonna get past this?  Cause, I will.",6,6,86
Michael,  Because I assumed that you want me to be happy because I want you to be happy.,6,6,86
Michael,  You know what?  I’m gonna start dating her even harder.,6,6,86
Michael,"  I don’t need to be friends with Pam.  I have plenty of female friends.  My mom, Pam’s mom, my aunt… although she just blocked me on IM, what’s her face from Quiznos, I see her four times a week.    				",6,6,86
Michael,"  [leaving his office with his rum] Night everyone.  Night Pam, thanks again for the rum.  ",6,6,86
Michael, Join your gangsta pumpkin on his palette truck of doom. Don’t worry about a thing. Rest assured you will see me later. Bwah ha ha…  [bumps into something] … ha ha ha.  				,6,7,87
Michael, I am going to scare these kids so bad.  				,6,7,87
Michael," Kids, just remember, suicide is never the answer. Alright?  				",6,7,87
Michael, Why is Christmas the only holiday that can have a message?  				,6,7,87
Michael, It is the easy way out. You are not alone.,6,7,87
Michael, …and then I think I’m going to go to the Garlic Festival.,6,7,87
Michael, Sounds like fun. You guys would love it.,6,7,87
Michael, I can’t believe it’s- I can’t believe it’s yogurt. Uh… it’ll be fun,6,7,87
Michael, You should give them a call. Check that out.,6,7,87
Michael," Jim’s a good kid. He can handle a lot but sometimes you have to call in a master. I, uh… why would you date an amateur when you could date a professional?  				",6,7,87
Michael," Why don’t they just want you to go by yourself? Why do they want me to come, too? I don’t understand.",6,7,87
Michael," I don’t want you to feel like I’m baby-sitting you, or something. Alright.",6,7,87
Michael," Yeah, well… this is not the phone. This is real life, baby, and you gotta own it. Is that what you are wearing?",6,7,87
Michael, …and that is the watch that you are going to wear? No. It is not. You should wear this watch. I will loan it to you. It is a Tankard. I highly recommend you wear that.,6,7,87
Michael, They are into appearance. We are selling success.,6,7,87
Michael, That’s sorta secondary. [offers Jim the watch again],6,7,87
Michael," Uh, well, Jim and I got caught in a little flash rain, flash wind, flash lightning.",6,7,87
Michael, It was. It was. And then in an instant it wasn’t.,6,7,87
Michael," Ok. Put them on speaker. Hey guys, what’s going on?",6,7,87
Michael, Uh… I can’t really hear you. I think we have sort of a bad connection.,6,7,87
Michael, It was- Ok. This is what it was. It was these bunch of idiots who had put a fish tank in the ground with no cover and no railing.,6,7,87
Michael, No. Maybe I was trying to save a child that had fallen in.,6,7,87
Michael," No it is- don’t! I’m not gonna bump. I’m not gonna bump. And it was not hilarious. It was very, very terrifying. [Stanley laughs]  				",6,7,87
Michael," Erin, do we have any of those clips that hold paper together?",6,7,87
Michael," I can name Pixar movies, too. Toy Story.",6,7,87
Michael, I’m not usually the butt of the joke. I’m usually the face of the joke. I wish Jim had fallen into that pond and he’d have to put on my suit and it’d be too short and he’d look… Damn it! He’d still look good.  				,6,7,87
Michael, The most fundamental thing about sensitivity training is that you cannot make fun of a person for something or some action that they have done that they regret. Show of hands- who has been ‘Koi-ponded’? Who here’s been the butt of a joke that has gone too far? Phyllis?,6,7,87
Michael," Well, it is hard to tell the difference between you guys saying, ‘Stop because I want you to stop’ or STOP as in ‘Stop. You’re making me laugh so hard. What you’re doing is so funny. You are on a roll. I am busting a gut. Stop!’",6,7,87
Michael," We are going to make a ‘Do Not Mock’ list. Ok? Anything that we think might be out of bounds, we put on this list. Anything you put on this list you cannot be teased about. Got it? I’m gonna kick it off. Let’s see what I have to put on the list, right? [writes ‘Koi pond’ on the list] Ok. I also have fallen into the fountain at the Steamtown Mall. Ok. Who else? Who else? Dwight, come on.",6,7,87
Michael, No. I haven’t finished writing. Did you sneeze it off? That’s it. No more. Ok. Who else? Who else? Everybody’s getting their chance.,6,7,87
Michael, Ok. That’s to broad. It’s gotta be something else. How ’bout your stomach? Yeah? [writes Huge Gut] Meredith?,6,7,87
Michael, Ok. Fine. Come on up here. Write it yourself. And don’t sign your name to it. And nobody look. Everybody look away. Look away.  				,6,7,87
Michael, It could’ve died of natural causes. So… ,6,7,87
Michael," Do not mock, Oscar. Do not mock. How much do they want?",6,7,87
Michael, What? No. I could get a fish for a 5 cent worm. ,6,7,87
Michael," No, Jim. You don’t understand. Things like this don’t just die. Kids in high school still call me ‘Ponytail’. ",6,7,87
Michael," Yes, they do, Jim. Because of the time I got my ponytail stuck in the power trail.",6,7,87
Michael, No. Don’t do that. You’re not. You’re not stupid.,6,7,87
Michael," Hey. I- I just wanna say that I cannot believe that I walked into a Koi pond. I mean, seriously. Walk much? [everyone starts laughing] Oh. I should wear a snorkel to the next business meeting that I go to.",6,7,87
Michael," Well, you know what? You’re right, Phyllis, but I’ve been there before. I’ve seen that pond. This is the thing, I am a world class moron. That’s the problem.",6,7,87
Michael," It’s ok. We’re having fun. It’s not actually the first time I’ve been embarrassed by a pond. In high school, the girls volleyball team always used to hrow me into the frozen lake. Four years in a row. Oh… it was freezing. [Jim signals for making to stop] No. No. No. Oh, this is even worse. [Michael begins to lose his cool] Couple weeks ago I went to get a new cellphone and I wanted on of those packages where you have, you know, the friends- the five- the friends and family thing and the guys was like, ‘Who are your 5 friends?’ and I’m, like, ‘Uh… ‘ I didn’t even know I couldn’t even think. [realizing he’s going downhill] Oh, my God. It was so embarrassing. That was- oh. I don’t even have Jan’s cell phone number and I hate her! She won’t give it to me. I was like, ‘Oh, I guess I’m a loser. ‘A luh-whooooo a za her’.  Too far! God! Thanks a lot, man. Thanks for the advice.  				",6,7,87
Michael, Hey. Who wants to watch Michael’s pond dive? My roommate’s friend is the night janitor over there. He swiped the security tape for me and he’s bringing it over.,6,7,87
Michael, No. It’s ok. Watch it. He can’t fire all of you.,6,7,87
Michael, Jim is jealous of me? Jim is jealous of me.  				,6,7,87
Michael," No. He’s a- yeah, he’s alright. Ok. [holds door open as they exit]",6,7,87
Michael, You’re welcome. Whoa! [leans back] Almost fell. [they both laugh]  				,6,7,87
Michael, No.  I had a fish stick sandwich.  Actually I had two fish stick sandwiches.  My girlfriend didn’t want hers.  Because I guess I’m the only aphrodisiac she needs.   ,6,8,88
Michael, [comes over to hug them both] My girls.  There they are. [Pam walks away]  				,6,8,88
Michael,"  Birthday lunch.  Birthday lunch– there is no better medicine than birthday lunch.  It’ll cure all of your “Gee I don’t know if Michael should be dating my mother” and fixes all occurrences of “I don’t really see them together”.  So, open wide Pam and take a big old spoonful of birthday lunch medicine.  Take with food.    				",6,8,88
Michael,  I think everyone has meet Helene.  Shall we?  				,6,8,88
Michael,  Yeah. The rest of the story has been censored due to– inappropriosity.     ,6,8,88
Michael,"  Please, Kevin.  You’re fired.  [Kevin looks at Jim; Jim shakes his head]  Sorry, sorry.  Work with a bunch of idiots.  Shall we go?",6,8,88
Michael,"  Just want you to succeed Pammy.  You know what, we shouldn’t even be talking about business today.",6,8,88
Michael,  What table should we take?  So many to choose from.  ,6,8,88
Michael," What? All I see are boring old tables with no birthday decorations.  Oh, wait a second!  You mean this one?  Wow!",6,8,88
Michael,  Not about taking credit.  Let’s just say we all did it.  ,6,8,88
Michael,"  Well, it was actually me alone, so– wow look at this place.  Really makes me want to go to Italy some day.  ",6,8,88
Michael, Oh. Thank you.  Thanks for lending me the books.   ,6,8,88
Michael,  The only time you should care about a woman’s age is if she is too young for you and I am not robbing the cradle.  If anything I am robbing the grave.  				,6,8,88
Michael," Hey, would you guys ever do a triathlon, do you think?",6,8,88
Michael," I am.  I’m definitely going to do it.  I’ve already got the run and the bike thing down.  Just need to learn how to swim.  Come on, you in?",6,8,88
Michael," So it’s a matter of interest.  Good, okay.  It’s not anything you would have ever done.   ",6,8,88
Michael,  Well there’s no jumping in a triathlon.,6,8,88
Michael,  You’re thinking of the broad jump.  Would you try– bungee jumping?,6,8,88
Michael,  [sighs] Nothing.  Just life– and doing things– before you die. I don’t know.  				,6,8,88
Michael, Do I really want to go snowboarding?  No.  But I would like to if I wanted to.   				,6,8,88
Michael," Oh, no, no, no. No.  It’s stupid.  You’d hate it.  I hate it.  ",6,8,88
Michael,  I literally– I put no thought into the wrapping at all.  Might as well of been toilet paper.  ,6,8,88
Michael,"  It’s not amazing… at all.  It’s sort of weird that I went and did that.  And now your wish won’t come true, so that blows.  ",6,8,88
Michael,"  Well, that’s because you and I have very different tastes and you like lame things.  It’s a generational– sort of gap between us.  ",6,8,88
Michael,"  Honestly, for a long time I thought I was going to grow old with Holly.  And then I met Helene.  And she is great and she already knows and has done everything  that I have ever wanted to do and can tell me about it.  But, I think I want to do those things myself.    				",6,8,88
Michael,"  I want you to enjoy that cake because I have something terrible  I need to tell you.  I want you to enjoy your cake before I tell you this terrible, terrible thing.    				",6,8,88
Michael,"  Helene I think you’re a wonderful person and I– God– I’ve enjoyed dating you and being your boyfriend so much.  But I have to consider Pam’s feelings as a friend and a co-worker I can not in good conscience continue to date you, when I know what this is doing to her.  ",6,8,88
Michael,  Wow.  That just– you’ve really grown.  ,6,8,88
Michael," [covering eyes] Thank you Pam. And I hope you are as gracious during this next part.  Helene, once again you are a wonderful person and you have lived a great life and I envy it.  And I want it someday, but just in the future.  You need somebody who– who understands your references.  Who is Kafkaesque?  I’ve never– I don’t know him.  There’s another woman.  And her name is Italy… and skydiving… and bungee jumping.  ",6,8,88
Michael," And I want kids.  And you… unfortunately, have already completed that part of your journey down there.  ",6,8,88
Michael,  It’s not my decision.  It’s mother nature.  And mother has very strict rules about fer–  [waitress comes over to pour water; long pause] — tility.,6,8,88
Michael, May I have a word with you in my office please?,6,8,88
Michael," Yes.  Join me please, won’t you? [Pam gets up and follows Michael into his office]  I am going to give you a raise.  ",6,8,88
Michael, Because of all the good work you’ve done.,6,8,88
Michael,"  That’s– no, no– it’s not about numbers, Pam.  It’s about attitude.",6,8,88
Michael," Hey, Pam, Pam– with this raise there are strings attached.  [Pam sighs]  And the string is attached from my heart to your mean attitude.  ",6,8,88
Michael, No!  No– no I am not.  Unless you want me to.  DO you want me to? Cause I will.  I will bribe you.  No.  Your face is saying don’t– unless I haven’t offered you enough… your face isn’t changing.  What is it?  Talk to me face.  Tell me what Pam’s brain is thinking.  Come on!  What do you want? What do you want?  Do you want a million dollars?  Do you want to hit me?  Want me to get down on one knee and beg you or– ,6,8,88
Michael," [nervous laughter] Oh– okay , what? I don’t– Are you kidding?",6,8,88
Michael, Ye– No.  Alright.  I’ll take off my jacket and tense my stomach and you can just– ,6,8,88
Michael, Never.  About what?  A little– what are you talking– ,6,8,88
Michael, I mean– do you ever wrestle with each other?,6,8,88
Michael, How much time do you think you’ll need?,6,8,88
Michael, Am I scared of getting hit in the face?  No.  Everyday weirdo’s pay dominatrix’s hundreds of dollars for that very privilege.  I’m scared I’m gonna love it.  [claps hands] Let’s do this.    				,6,8,88
Michael, It’s okay guys… I can handle this.  Everybody can go home.,6,8,88
Michael, You’re just a bunch of voyeurs.  Are you eating popcorn?,6,8,88
Michael,  I know. [sighs] Okay.  Alright.  [Pam goes to punch him again] Oh– God!,6,8,88
Michael," Okay! [braces himself] Pam, Pam– I’m really sorry.  I’m sorry.  ",6,8,88
Michael, So many things.  I don’t know.  It’s hard to choose.  ,6,8,88
Michael,  Okay.  I promise.  [Pam starts to walk away] For the record your mom came on to me. [Pam turns around and slaps him; he gasps]  ,6,8,88
Michael," As I watched Pam’s big, strong hand coming towards my face I saw my entire life flash before my eyes.  And guess what?  I have four kids.  And I have a hover-car and a hover-house.  And my wife is a runner and it shows.  And Pam and Jim are my best friends and our kids play together.  And I am happy and I am rich and I never die.  It doesn’t sound like much, but its enough for me.  				",6,8,88
Michael, Ahh… [Dwight is holding a frozen chicken to his face],6,8,88
Michael, Oh thank you.  Thanks.  I owe you one Dwight.    ,6,8,88
Michael, [pats face] Oh that feels better.    				,6,8,88
Michael,  But I would say my favorite art form is a tie between sculpting and stand up comedy.,6,9,89
Michael,"  You’ll have to be more specific Dwight, I get like eight emails a day.",6,9,89
Michael,  It’s $1.99 to finish the article.  I wonder what it was going to say? [no one makes a move to pay for the article],6,9,89
Michael,"  Oh God.  Well, that’s an interesting theory.",6,9,89
Michael,"  Ah, well maybe you should spy on him.  [in Valley Girl voice] Oh my God, wouldn’t that be hilarious! [laughs]",6,9,89
Michael,"  OK, OK.  Good.  I’ll catch you on the flippity flip.  Bye. [hangs up phone]  He’s busy, he’ll call me back when he’s free.  				",6,9,89
Michael,"  No, I’m just poopin’.  You know how I be.",6,9,89
Michael,"  OK, we need some sort of distraction for everybody.  Anything new on YouTube?  Doesn’t even need to be good.  Oh God, I can’t think, need more Mullins. ",6,9,89
Michael," [walks back in, on cell phone] What? Oh my God!  [everyone starts asking questions]  There has been a murder.  There’s been a murder in Savannah. [runs back to his office]  				",6,9,89
Michael,"  Games have the power to distract people from stressful situations.  Battleship got me through my parents’ divorce.  Operation got me through my vasectomy, i.e., my operation.  I don’t think I would have been able to endure my breakup with Holly had it not been for Toss Across.  				",6,9,89
Michael," It is so much fun.  Everybody plays a character, we go around the room, we try to figure out who did it… ",6,9,89
Michael,"  This is my call Jim, big picture stuff, it’s about murder.",6,9,89
Michael," There will be food. You leave, you do not get food.",6,9,89
Michael, Baby carrots. [Angela sits back down]  				,6,9,89
Michael,"  OK, here are your character cards.  Take one, pass it down. Here is your prop box, some of your characters will have props.  Now, on your character card, it tells you who you are, and what your alibi is.  Everything else is up to your imagination.  So, if you talk slowly in real life, your character could, say, have been kicked in the head by a horse.",6,9,89
Michael,"  Well how do you think I feel?  I mean I have to play Caleb Crawdad, handsome playboy.  Every night, a different woman.  Being oogled.  Having to hug and kiss and spoon, I make them feel beautiful.  				",6,9,89
Michael,"  [looks at Oscar who is using his phone, grabs it] Well, well, well.  What is this contraption, I do declare?",6,9,89
Michael,"  Who’s Michael?  I’m Caleb Crawdad, I do declare.",6,9,89
Michael,"  Delta Burke, I do declare.  Now, shall we get to the mystery?",6,9,89
Michael,"  No, no, no. Don’t turn this into a political thing.",6,9,89
Michael,"  Oooooo, doggie, we got a party now!  				",6,9,89
Michael, I do believe that the game is a big hit. People are really diving into their characters.  				,6,9,89
Michael,"  [accent] Sir, there has been a murder, and you are a suspect.",6,9,89
Michael,"  Very good, very good.  Now, no one was there in the wine cellar. [Creed gets in his car and drives away]    				",6,9,89
Michael,"  [accent] Whoa. What’s this strange Yankee accent coming out of your mouth, son?  This here’s Savannah.",6,9,89
Michael,  No no no no no no no. [accent] I’m going to skip forward to a relevant clue.  Here we go.  				,6,9,89
Michael,"  [accent] Are you going to believe that? That is a mis- that’s a misdirection.  We still don’t know who the murderer is.  [everyone leaves] Nellie Nutmeg, come back in here.  I can’t do this myself.  Voodoo Mama Juju… what am I gonna do?  				",6,9,89
Michael," [accent] I do believe you have me mistaken, my name is Caleb Crawdad. Y’all skedaddled way too soon.  We need to reopen this case.",6,9,89
Michael," I already declared you, it was too dark to tell.",6,9,89
Michael,"  This is not a game, this is my life.  You are out of order, sir.",6,9,89
Michael,"  [comes into Jim’s office using accent] Deb, what in the world – do you have the vapors?",6,9,89
Michael,"  Can’t wait, we have to get you to our witch doctor right now.  Come on.  Come on.",6,9,89
Michael,  Because this is the recreation of a crime scene.,6,9,89
Michael,"  No, you shut up.  They need this game, Jim.  Let us have this stupid little game, alright? [Jim nods]  				",6,9,89
Michael,"  [accent] Oh, you startled me.  My stars, my heart nearly leapt out of my chest.  What can I do you for?",6,9,89
Michael,"  No, I only answer to Detective Wallace ’cause I got a warm body in the other room.",6,9,89
Michael,"  There has been a lot of murder and a lot of intrigue.  My little heart can barely take it no more.  [regular voice] Today is the hardest I have worked in a long, long time.    				",6,9,89
Michael,  On the count of three we’re all going to put down our guns.,6,9,89
Michael,"  We’ll put down our weaponry on the count of three, you ready?",6,9,89
Michael," [seated] Ok. Ok. How ’bout this? [rises, waves, sits back down]",6,10,90
Michael," I want it to be better than ‘Great’, Pam. How ’bout I remain seated… and I just do a little bit of a nod. Sort of a humble thing. [demonstrates]",6,10,90
Michael, Nope. Then my face is down. They can’t see my face. ,6,10,90
Michael," Alan Brand is the CEO of the company, if title’s important to you, has personally invited moi to go to New York to the shareholder’s meeting  and sit up on the stage with the board of directors. And at some point they are going to introduce me as the most successful branch manager that they have. And then Michael Scott turns and waves to the crowd… and the crowd goes wild.  				",6,10,90
Michael, Ok. Obviously I’m not going to do the twirl. I only did it because I nailed the wave.,6,10,90
Michael," I am not going to do the twirl. Alright? It’s not even a twirl, it’s a spin. I might do the spin.  				",6,10,90
Michael," Ok, Oscar, I don’t need the whole enchilada just the bullet points.",6,10,90
Michael," It’s not a limo. It’s a town car. Town cars are actually better, though. Better torque. Better handling.",6,10,90
Michael, Town cars suck. Town car is something that a company sends when they’re in trouble. A limousine is something that a company sends when they have cause for celebration. And in this case I think we are celebrating me.  				,6,10,90
Michael," [everyone is rushing down the stairs to see the limo] Oh, wait. Wait. Wow. Wow! Oh, no way. Look at that.",6,10,90
Michael, Hate to break it to you Oscar but some of us like boobs.,6,10,90
Michael," Hey, you know who you should be jealous of? Yourself. Because you’re invited and you’re invited and you’re invited and you and you and you and you and you and you-",6,10,90
Michael, The limo seats eight. Ok. Then Jim and Pam and Ryan plus a guest.,6,10,90
Michael, [others  start raising their hands to be picked] Mmm… whoa.  				,6,10,90
Michael," [in the limo with Dwight, Andy and Oscar] I wish the windows weren’t tinted so people could see us in here.",6,10,90
Michael, Definitely. Look they got pillows. That. That’s bigger than my bed.,6,10,90
Michael, [the limo driver raises the divider window] Who’s playing with the button?  				,6,10,90
Michael," No, no. That’s too hard. Say your name is Zamboni and then I will say, ‘Well, we’re sort of on thin ice.’ [they all laugh] I won’t say that. I’ll something like that.",6,10,90
Michael," Well, thank you and, and please call – continue to call me Mr. Scott.",6,10,90
Michael," Well, I guess this is as far as I can take you guys. So –",6,10,90
Michael, [walking past bodyguards at the door] Officers. Thank you.,6,10,90
Michael," Oh. It was awesome. Very, very sublime.",6,10,90
Michael," It’s nice to meet you, too. It’s an honor and a privilege. ",6,10,90
Michael, What about Madonna? Or Obama twins? Anybody famous?,6,10,90
Michael, Rock and roll. [they walk into convention room and are booed by everyone]  				,6,10,90
Michael, [to David] This is not as much fun as I thought it would be.,6,10,90
Michael," [accidentally into his microphone] We’re going bankrupt, you think? [angry jeering from the crowd] They are really angry.",6,10,90
Michael," Hey, hey, hey. I’m sorry. These are not criminals. They are nice. They invited me to come here today. They invited me to their hospitality suite where I  had free food and it was delicious. Get this. Know how nice they are? The sent a stretch limo all the way to pick me up in Scranton. That’s –",6,10,90
Michael," [board of directors has started to exit] Yeah, well, that’s not gonna happen. That’s not gonna happen. We’ll be back with some answers. [a few murmurs from the crowd of ‘What answers?’] I – ok. I know that you’re mad at me and you’re mad at all them –",6,10,90
Michael," Ok. Alright. We are gonna – we’re gonna go out there during this break and we are gonna come back with a plan. We’re gonna come back with a plan for you. It’s a 45 day plan. 45 days to get us back on track. [crowd starts to agree and perk up] 45 points. It’s a 45 day/45 point. One point per day. We get the 45 points we are back in business. [crowd applauds] And you can take that to the bank. [applause continue] And Limo Lady, we are going completely carbon neutral. [crowd has gotten very excited and is cheering] I love you, New York! [Michael does the spin and leaves the stage – then runs back across the stage] You. You.  				",6,10,90
Michael, I did wave. I did a lot more than wave.,6,10,90
Michael," Here’s what we’re gonna do. The 45 day thing that I outlined, we go with that. Day 45, company saved. Day 44, go. What do we got? We have 15 minutes.",6,10,90
Michael, Just whatever comes to mind. Shout it out.,6,10,90
Michael," Ok. Alright. Well, I know a guy. This Mexican guy. He is a math whiz. He knows economics as well as he knows bull fighting and I am going to call in a little favor.",6,10,90
Michael," It’s done. [Oscar, sitting in the lobby, receives a text]  				",6,10,90
Michael," Oh. There he is. Come on in. Come on in. Gentleman, I would like you to meet Oscar. Come on in. Don’t be shy. This is Oscar Martinez. Oscar, why don’t you come over here. Let me present you. Step up. Step up there. Oscar is an accountant extraordinaire at the Scranton branch and he has a wonderful idea as to how to get us out of this murky, murky situation. Take it away. [Oscar stands there stunned]  				",6,10,90
Michael, Tell them what you told me. This is genius. ,6,10,90
Michael, Tell them about the cash flow and the dumping of properties and – this is all – ,6,10,90
Michael, It’s all good. It’s all good stuff. Lay it on them.,6,10,90
Michael, That wasn’t what you were saying to me. He was much more articulate and that was better. Much better. ,6,10,90
Michael," O-kay. Oh… hey, hey. [follows Oscar into the hall] What are you doing?",6,10,90
Michael," Well, that was a waste of a text. Let’s get down to brass tacks. I think that we might be in trouble. We don’t seem to have a plan so I’m thinking I go down there. Maybe rattle off a few jokes. Congressman could follow. ",6,10,90
Michael," Uh, I’m not a moron. Time after time my branch leads in sales. I have personally won over 17 Dundie awards. So, I am not a moron and I am just trying to help, you know? So… you’re the moron.   				",6,10,90
Michael, [zipping through the hall while texting]  				,6,10,90
Michael," Yes it is a thrill to be honored by one’s company. To have the people that you work for stop for a minute and say, ‘Wow. Great job.’  That is what it is all about. Not the perks. Perks? The perks. I could take or leave the perks.  Limos are for people who make the company money not lose millions and have no plan. So we’re leaving early. After all, we are the only ones with anything to celebrate.  				",6,10,90
Michael," [running out of the building with Oscar, Andy, and Dwight] Oscar! Oscar! Come on!  There he is! There he is! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!  Scranton! Scranton! Scranton! Dunder Mifflin!  				",6,10,90
Michael," Okay, right there is the problem.  There have been reports around the office that you have been talking baby talk.",6,11,91
Michael, I have it on good authority that you said the following. [hands Andy a notecard]  Can you read that back to me?,6,11,91
Michael," You are also on record as saying “wittle-ittle,” “footy-wutties,” “nummies,” “jammies,” “make boom-boom,” “widiculous,” and “wode iwand.”",6,11,91
Michael, You can’t be a baby in the office.  It makes me look like I hire babies.,6,11,91
Michael," [Elvis voice] Well, thank you… thank you a lot.  And for what it’s worth I think your baby voice is tops.",6,11,91
Michael, I want to keep those so I can see what I sent.,6,11,91
Michael, Oh okay.  I don’t know how those got on there…,6,11,91
Michael," What if I told you I had done the worst thing ever, would you still want to be my friend?",6,11,91
Michael, Is that what we’re going for now?  “okay?”  We used to go for “pretty good.”,6,11,91
Michael," Yeah, you know what, that actually might make me feel better.  I’m not in this for the trophies, but…",6,11,91
Michael," Well, technically, I’m a co-manager, and I barely have any responsibilities, but I work hard, I love this company, and for those reasons, I think I would make a good employee of the month.",6,11,91
Michael,"  It would look good, on my mantle.  				",6,11,91
Michael, There you are.  I don’t think we have finished with my Inbox.,6,11,91
Michael," Yeah, okay.  Call the school, cancel.  I can’t go through with this.",6,11,91
Michael," I just, I fell in love with those kids.  and I didn’t want to see them fall victim to the system, so I made them a promise.  I told them that if they graduated from high school, I would pay for their college education.  I’ve made some empty promises in my life, but hands down, that was the most generous.  				",6,11,91
Michael," Just tell me it is going to be okay, all right?",6,11,91
Michael," I’m not a bad person, I bring good news.  Like when I promised those kids I’d pay for college.  Okay, all right.",6,11,91
Michael," Would you come with me?  You know, like old times, instead of… [makes yuck face at Erin]",6,11,91
Michael," Agh, God, you know what, could this day get any worse?  				",6,11,91
Michael, Good to see you.  Where’s your saxaphone?,6,11,91
Michael," Eigth grade graduation, she gave a rendition of When The Saints Go Marching In that would blow your freaking mind.",6,11,91
Michael," Oh, you know what?  You know what?  I shouldn’t go in there.  I’m pretty busy, I should just…",6,11,91
Michael," All right.  Wow.  Um, I am never going to forget today.  Not a chance.  I don’t think I could ever give back to you what you have given me today.  Who here has done something stupid in their lives?  Like skipped out on study hall or mix up the difference between “A” gym and “B” gym, that sort of thing?  Show of hands, anybody, yes, a bunch of you, okay.  Well, me too, I’ve done something stupid which I would like to share.  Ummm. [period bell rings] Should we go?",6,11,91
Michael," Ah.  All right.  I came here today because I promised you tuition and tuition is very valuable.  But you know what’s invaluable is intuition.  You know what that is?  That is the ability to know when something is about to happen.  Does anybody out there have intuition?  Know what’s gonna happen next?  Nobody?  Okay, you’re going to make me say it.  All right, I am so proud of all of you.  Derrick, and Lefevre, and Ben, and Ayana, and Mikela, and Nikki and Jason, and… I’m sorry, okay, sorry spacing, your name?",6,11,91
Michael," Well Zion, I am not going to be paying for your college tuition.  Which brings me to my main point and that is that I will not be able to pay for anybody’s tuition.  I’m so, so sorry.  				",6,11,91
Michael," I lied to myself too.  I’m not a millionaire.  I thought I would be by the time I was 30, but I wasn’t even close.  And then I thought maybe by the time I was 40, but by 40, I had less money than when I was 30.  Maybe by my 50s, I don’t know.  I wanted to pay for your education.  I really did.  It was my dream.  Some people have evil drems, some people have selfish dreams or wet dreams.  My dream was in the right place.",6,11,91
Michael," Okay, hold on.  Hold on.  Now I can’t pay for your college.  But you don’t have to go to class to be in class.  Online courses are a viable option to a traditional college experience.  And the best way to access those courses is with your own personal laptop. [students perk up] Which is rendered useless without batteries, and I have one for each of you.",6,11,91
Michael," Hey, hold-hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  They’re lithium.  				",6,11,91
Michael," Yeah. Yeah. I know, I know, I know, I’m sorry.",6,11,91
Michael," I can give you an extra laptop battery.  Not everyone took one.  How about this?  If you can find a way to pay for your college tuition, let me buy your books, okay?",6,11,91
Michael," Yeah, well, I owe you that at least, right?",6,11,91
Michael," For-okay, okay here’s what I’m gonna do.  I’m going to write 4 checks for $1,000 each.  I’m going to date them one year apart.  Now, you are to use one check a year.  And please call me before you cash the check?  Cause I’ve got monies to move around.",6,11,91
Michael, Please stop.  15 lives.  I destroyed 15 young lives today.,6,11,91
Michael," What do you want from this job, provided the company doesn’t go out of business?",6,11,91
Michael," You know, when I hired Kevin, he was actually applying for a job in the warehouse.",6,11,91
Michael, Yeah.  I just sort’ve had a feeling about him.  I have a feeling about you too.,6,11,91
Michael," Heeeeeere’s Santa! Hey little girl, what would you like for Christmas? Ooh, you have been a very naughty girl, I see. [points to Pam’s’ pregnant tummy]",6,12,92
Michael," It’s insane! A woman Santa, where does it stop? No! Jim, this may be the last Christmas that we have here, doesn’t it make you a tiny bit anxious, me NOT playing Santa? Come on!",6,12,92
Michael," Fine! Then do it anonymously. Ransom note style. You can- I -you know what, I have a bunch of letters cut out of magazines in my desk. You can use those.  ",6,12,92
Michael," If this were Russia, yeah sure. Everyone would go to one Santa, and there would be a line around the block and once you sat on her lap and she’d ask you what you wanted, you would say probably “freedom.” At which point the KGB would arrest you and send you to Siberia. It’s a good thing Russia doesn’t exist anymore.  ",6,12,92
Michael," [santa voice] Ho ho ho! Why pay more to sit next to old Tranny Claus over there, when you can sit on my lap. Phyllis is only … pretending to be a man, I’m the real thing. Sit down on my lap and there will be no doubt!",6,12,92
Michael," No it’s not, not like penis-wise. [as Santa] Hello little boy, what’s your name?",6,12,92
Michael," Oh! I am so sorry that Phyllis hates you. And hates your body. But, Santa remembers a reindeer that was just a tiny bit different as well.",6,12,92
Michael," Right now! Come on over here, big boy! There we go. [Kevin sits on his lap. It’s a struggle] Oh my God.",6,12,92
Michael, What would you like for Christmas little boy?,6,12,92
Michael, What did you think was going to happen?,6,12,92
Michael," All right, just say “some toys” please.",6,12,92
Michael," Okay get off, get off! [pushes Kevin off] Oh! Oh, God!",6,12,92
Michael, Okay you know what you get? You get a thousand helium balloons attached to you so Santa doesn’t have to go through this again.,6,12,92
Michael, Ahhh… Ho ho ho! [struggles to pull Ryan towards him] Come on I need this. Come over here! ,6,12,92
Michael, Yup. Ryan and I are just having some fun!,6,12,92
Michael," Okay. You know what Jim, there are two Santas in the room. Things get ruthless! ",6,12,92
Michael," Oh, do we? Do “We?” Is that what “we” want? Why don’t “we” take a vote on it?",6,12,92
Michael, Hey! Okay! Everybody! The office is being pulled apart! I realize that. There are traditions at stake. And there are–,6,12,92
Michael," No no no wait! No! There are other choices, there is information that we –[Dwight counts the raised hands] Are you kidding me? Kevin? After you almost killed me?",6,12,92
Michael, I’ll get some punch. That looks delicious. [shoves Santa hat into punch],6,12,92
Michael," I don’t ask for much for Christmas, I really don’t. It’s not like I’m begging people to buy me diamonds and …broach pendants. “Oh buy me something expensive or I’m gonna kill myself.”  That’s not – I don’t care about that. All I want to be is Santa. And, you want to take that away from me?  Fine. Go ahead. But when you need my help because I am ruining everything, don’t look at me.  ",6,12,92
Michael," Behold! [extends his arms] Jesus Christ. And I bring to you glad Christmas tidings. I want to remind everyone the true meaning of Christmas. [Angela claps] Those of you who wish to join me, that’s great. I’m excited by that. And those of you who don’t, I forgive you. But I never forget.",6,12,92
Michael, Oh but I can push drugs in here? Is that what you’re saying?,6,12,92
Michael," Well you have to pick one or the other. Your choice. Pick your poison. Get back to me. In the meantime, I am going to spread my goodness all over this company!  ",6,12,92
Michael," [on karaoke microphone] Uh oh, what’s Dwight gonna get? What is iiiit?",6,12,92
Michael, Oh yes. It’s space garbage. Dwight’s gonna be able to build himself a friend! [sings] Deck the halls with crappy gifts…,6,12,92
Michael," [on microphone] Yeah, except for cheating on your wife. Adultery’s a sin, look it up in the Bible people. What’d you get?",6,12,92
Michael," [on microphone] Oh, that’s appropriate. Lot of fire where you’re going. Better get used to it. You’re going to H-E-L-L double hockey sticks. You’re going to Hell Stanley.",6,12,92
Michael," [on microphone] I can’t see from here people. Somebody shout it out, don’t make me get up.",6,12,92
Michael, [on microphone] That’s fantastic. You can make another dress that goes past your feet.,6,12,92
Michael, [on microphone] What? Was I not supposed to say it? [Jim unplugs mic] What? Turn it back on.,6,12,92
Michael," David, guess who I’m sitting here dressed as.",6,12,92
Michael, I’ll give you a hint. His last name is Christ. He has the power of flight. He can heal leopards.,6,12,92
Michael," I’m Jesus, David, and you know why? Because Phyllis, a woman, has uslurped my role as Santa.",6,12,92
Michael, What the hell? How rude! Does she do that all the time?,6,12,92
Michael," Earlier today this office needed a Santa. And then it needed a second Santa. And then it needed a Jesus. And now, it needs a Michael. And that’s one suit Phyllis cannot fit into.  ",6,12,92
Michael, That was a different guy. That was Jesus. Jesus sort of ruined the party. Hurt petulant Jesus.,6,12,92
Michael," You know what’s even more offensive, is baling on this party because some…  jerk ruined the first part of it. Dwight come here. Here’s my debit card, I want you to go pick up a bunch of pizzas and meet me in the conference room.",6,12,92
Michael," I don’t want to say. But, “it’s fun to stay at the -” [nods to fill in blank, but Dwight doesn’t know]",6,12,92
Michael," [gestures the YMCA dance] Mmm, mm mm mm. [Dwight smirks, leaves]  ",6,12,92
Michael," You know what, Christmas isn’t about Santa, or Jesus. It’s about the workplace. All of you feel like my family. Ryan, you are my son. And Pam, you’re my wife. And Jim. And Angela and Phyllis, you are my Grandmas.  And Stanley, you’re our mailman. And I can’t help but look at all your wonderful beautiful faces and think, “How could they do this to us?” ",6,12,92
Michael, It’s not… Nevermind. Nothing. [arguing voices],6,12,92
Michael, David told me on the phone. David told me.,6,12,92
Michael," He said, we have been sold. [upset murmurs]",6,12,92
Michael, David’s gone. Alan’s gone. We’re all gone.,6,12,92
Michael," It’s hard for me to imagine a scenario, where Meredith Palmer keeps her job and David Wallace does not – no offense Meredith.",6,12,92
Michael," Yes, I will. Because I always know how to get through to him.  ",6,12,92
Michael," He told me where his kids go to school. I call the school, I tell them I’m a pediatrician. They patch me through to his secretary. I use my little girl voice. Badda bing, badda boom.  ",6,12,92
Michael," David, you are on speakerphone with the entire branch, and the warehouse.",6,12,92
Michael," David, they do not believe me. When you told me everyone was canned.",6,12,92
Michael, Yeah! [office erupts in cheers and applause and hugs] It’s a Christmas miracle! ,6,12,92
Michael," Woo hoo! [climbs on desk, stage dives into crowd of employees]  ",6,12,92
Michael, Oh! You got it? What is that? [Dwight building his gift],6,12,92
Michael," Huh. Well, maybe those will help. [puts bag of walnuts on his desk]",6,12,92
Michael," I would like an Xbox, and a TV that’s compatible with an Xbox. And, I’m sorry.",6,12,92
Michael," [entering on a Segway Scooter] I see you’ve met Computron, our virtual helper. I’m Michael Scott. Welcome. Welcome. Computron is just one of the many modern devices that I have incorporated into the office. Watch this. Computron?",6,13,93
Michael," That is fantastic. It’s good, but it’s not good enough. Keep working. And here’s Pam. She’s our international sales consultant.",6,13,93
Michael," Ok. Well, I thought I’d show you around a little bit – ",6,13,93
Michael," – since you made the trip out. And I got us reservations at Cooper’s Seafood. You like lobster? You’ve had lobster before, right?",6,13,93
Michael, They make the best Maine lobster in the world. You’ll love it.,6,13,93
Michael," No, Computron, actually I think Cooper’s is the best. You’re gonna love it.",6,13,93
Michael, Alright. Excuse me. [slides past Eric to close the door to Ryan’s closet office before Eric can see Ryan in there] If you will –,6,13,93
Michael," – follow me this way. I’ll introduce you to the crack HR rep that you requested. I give you Toby Flenderson. Have fun, you two. [Toby’s chair spins around to reveal Dwight filling in for Toby]",6,13,93
Michael," I left a copy of Best American Mystery Stories 1999 in Toby’s favorite stall. So, yes, I think I bought us some time.  				",6,13,93
Michael," Hey, Tobes. Whatcha doin’? Whatcha guys talkin’ about?",6,13,93
Michael, HR stuff? [pulls up a chair] HR Pufnstuf. Right up my alley. [pointing to Eric’s notes] What is that? What kind of stuff is that?,6,13,93
Michael, Waste? What does that even mean? Like garbage?,6,13,93
Michael," No. No. No. No. No. No. Respectfully, Toby, no. No. This company does not waste time or resources, ever. [clip montage]  				",6,13,93
Michael, This is a building where friends become lovers and lovers become sexually interactive. [to Toby] Right? Would you agree with that?,6,13,93
Michael," That’s, that is true. [clip montage]  				",6,13,93
Michael, I feel very sorry for that banker because he has to evaluate what we are worth. He has to decide what we are capable of and how do you do that? What is Jim capable of… or Pam… or Kevin? [clip montage over Daryl’s Dunder Mifflin jingle]  				,6,13,93
Michael, I don’t care if he goes and files a report and says that we’re nothing special because I think our future is very bright. We have only just begun.,6,13,93
Michael," Computron, I’m gonna pull your plug. Ok? Buddy?",6,13,93
Michael," [extended Lazy Scranton video] Sittin’ in my office with a plate of grilled bacon. Called my man, Dwight, just to see what was shakin’.",6,13,93
Michael," The Electric City. Lazy Scranton, the Electric City. They call it that ’cause of the electricity. The city’s laid out from East to West and our public parks are libraries are truly the best. Call poison control if you’re bitten by a spider.",6,13,93
Michael," It’s from “Sob-ray”, our new owner, and it is to Sabre, us. I wonder what’s inside. Scissor me. [Erin tosses Michael open scissors, Pam is appalled]  				",6,14,94
Michael,"  Dunder Mifflin was recently bought by an electronics company named Sabre. [mispronounced “sob-ray”]  They stepped in at the 11th hour, and they saved our asses.  Although David Wallace said that we were the one branch that was actually working right, so we probably could have saved our own asses. We didn’t need them touching our asses.  				",6,14,94
Michael," Oh! [rips open cardboard box] Wow. Awesome. [distributing items] For accounting, a brand new printer. And for the sales staff, a new fax machine. This cord has Creed written all over it. And whoever would like a brand new scanner can come visit it in my office. Thank you.  				",6,14,94
Michael, Cool. What next? [Dwight puts his face on scanner],6,14,94
Michael," Okay, everybody, listen up. I have some bad news. Due to circumstances beyond my control – ",6,14,94
Michael," Hey, hey. I have opened a box, which should not have been opened…",6,14,94
Michael, And distributed things which should not have been distributed.,6,14,94
Michael," And – [Jim seals box with tape, rips covered with stickers] Wow. Really nice job. This group of people, when they put their minds together, they can do something great. And I think that you should all be proud of yourselves. [cell phone starts ringing from inside box]",6,14,94
Michael," Alright, relax. We can do it. We just did it. So we can do this again. Erin, scissor me please. [Erin tosses open scissors across Jim and Pam]",6,14,94
Michael," Alright, he’s on his way up. Okay. Are we ready?",6,14,94
Michael, Gabe seems tall. Hope we get along. Had a very good thing going with David Wallace. He was a good guy. He was somebody I could trust. Here he is. [holding up photo of him and Wallace] You can really see that he is ok taking a picture with me. Even though I was there for disciplinary reasons.   				,6,14,94
Michael," You know what, Dwight? Let’s give him a minute to settle in, shall we? Ok?",6,14,94
Michael," Hello, Gabe. I am Michael Scott, co-manager. This is my protege, Jim Halpert. ",6,14,94
Michael," We’re very excited too, aren’t we guys? Right?",6,14,94
Michael, We have a little song prepared for you.,6,14,94
Michael," We’ll still get to use the little cups, though, right?",6,14,94
Michael," You know what can’t fit in a bottle, are the 20 little trips I take to the cooler, and the 20 little scans I do of everybody to make sure everything’s running smoothly. And the 20 little conversations that I have with Stanley.",6,14,94
Michael," There is a small part of me that is actually very excited about this new company. But 70 percent of me is water, and the other part, the real part, the part that has feelings and emotions and thoughts and makes decisions and, if I can be crass, makes babies, that part thinks that all of these changes suck ba –   				",6,14,94
Michael, [in line to fill up water bottle behind Kevin and Toby] Really? You don’t have enough water in there? Your stomach?,6,14,94
Michael, I miss the old Dunder Mifflin. Too much change is not a good thing. Ask the climate.  				,6,14,94
Michael, I don’t want to appear ungrateful for everything Sabre’s doing for us.,6,14,94
Michael," Well, you should have a little. But it’s great that you don’t, because I am trying to embrace all of these changes, but I’m – I’ll be honest, I’m having trouble wrapping my head around a couple of ’em.",6,14,94
Michael, So maybe we should call. We should call someone. I could help. I’m good with bosses. Call one of the higher-ups?,6,14,94
Michael, Hello. No. My name’s Michael Scott. Hello.,6,14,94
Michael, Nice to meet you. We are very excited about the merger with Sabre. I think you have a great accent.,6,14,94
Michael," Well, I am little concerned with all of these changes, to be quite frank. I think we have done things a certain way here at Dunder Mifflin for quite some time, and –",6,14,94
Michael, Ok. I feel very strongly that you can’t just come in here and change everything that people have been doing forever. Is Christian Slater back there? Because… he knows. He’d know what to do. ,6,14,94
Michael," I have already told him, but I will tell him again if you think that will help.",6,14,94
Michael," I have come here today to talk to Mr. David Wallace about this whole thing going on with Sabre. [rings doorbell] He will know exactly what to do. He is not a big fan of me dropping by announced. But then again, who is? [loud drumming as door opens] Hey. Hi, sorry.",6,14,94
Michael, I hope you’re not busy doing something.,6,14,94
Michael," Wow. Oh, yummy. [David spreads marshmallow fluff on bread] You have got the life, my friend. ",6,14,94
Michael, Can I just stay here and never go back?,6,14,94
Michael," Hi. Sorry, I was just in the neighborhood, thought I’d come by, see…",6,14,94
Michael," Sabre is changing everything. [Michael and David sitting in hot tub] Site blockers. They don’t let us use cups. So I started thinking, who could handle this? Who would know what to do? David Wallace would know what to do. What should I do, David Wallace?",6,14,94
Michael, So the kid’s making the noise to pick it up.,6,14,94
Michael, There are very few things that would make me not want to team up with David Wallace. And Suck It is one of ’em.   				,6,14,94
Michael," Well, that’s not the David Wallace that I remember. [reverses out of driveway, Wallace follows him] That is some sort of weird creature that lives in David Wallace’s house. Oh, my god. Alright. Just get me out of here.   				",6,14,94
Michael," Hello. [comes in carrying 4 gallons of orange juice and his water bottle] Is anybody home? Oh, thank you, Erin. Now if everyone would please ready their canteens, so I can fill them with the sweet, sweet nectar of Gabe’s homeland, and then propose a toast. Here we go.  				",6,14,94
Michael, You know when people say getting fired was the best thing that ever happened to them? I feel sorry for those people. That’s the best thing? Really? Ugh.   				,6,14,94
Michael," Well, I’m not really one for making speeches.",6,14,94
Michael, But I feel pretty good right now. I really do. A lot better than I did earlier. Let me tell you. ,6,14,94
Michael, No. This is my toast.  I think this whole thing with Sabre is going to work out. I have a very good feeling about it. ,6,14,94
Michael," Here’s my toast. Orange juice is in here. And, like Saber, it is from Florida, and it is good. ",6,14,94
Michael, Here’s the toast. I’m gonna do it now. Raise your container to us and to Sabre.,6,14,94
Michael," Mm. Wow. That is metallicy. Ugh. That’s like drinking a battery. Ah, really gets you in the fillings, doesn’t it? Okay, anyway, welcome.   				",6,14,94
Michael, No. [to hotel employee on phone] We’re trying to look it up right now.,6,15,95
Michael," Well, I have been booked for three years, so you should have that. I’ve always heard that British Columbia is a very nice place, but I am not getting that from this conversation.",6,15,95
Michael," Alright, I would like to cancel my reservation, please.",6,15,95
Michael," Today, Jo Bennett, the CEO from Sabre, is coming to see us here for the first time. She bought us sight unseen, like a mail-order bride, so she’s gotta be kinda nervous. I mean, are we ugly? Are we smart? Are we cool? Are we too cool? Do we speak English?  				",6,15,95
Michael," [Jo Bennett enters with two humongous dogs, everyone stands to welcome her except Dwight] Why hello!",6,15,95
Michael," Jo, I don’t know how things work in Florida, which from your description sounds like a colorful, lawless swamp, but here it takes two men to do one job, where in Florida it might take one very strong woman to do such a job.",6,15,95
Michael, And sometimes I can hardly handle that!,6,15,95
Michael, I humbly accept the management position.,6,15,95
Michael," Because, well, Jim. Where I’m from, two types of folk:",6,15,95
Michael, I will try to manage my excitement!  				,6,15,95
Michael," I have been saying the word “manager” a lot, so whenever Jo thinks “manager” she thinks of me. Camel cigarettes did the same thing with Joe Camel by making him look like a penis. I can’t even go near a cigarette now without thinking of a penis. And vise-versa.  				",6,15,95
Michael, Sure. You here to tell me that you think I would be a better manager and that you are sorry for being such a jerk?,6,15,95
Michael," Oh, that is my favorite ocean! I love it! I am so happy right now. No! I can’t keep it a secret any longer. Jim is stepping down to salesman, I am going to be the sole manager once again.",6,15,95
Michael," Well, according to the manual, there is no cap on commissions. I have been hustled.  				",6,15,95
Michael, Son of a bitch. [enters conference room] Pardon me.,6,15,95
Michael," Really? Aw, that is so sweet of you! But, I cannot accept, because I have been thinking about it, and I think I wanna go back to sales.",6,15,95
Michael," Yeah. You can take the man out of the salesman, but you can’t take the sales out of salesman.",6,15,95
Michael," No, I think I would be bad. I would sleep in my office, and I would sexually harass people.",6,15,95
Michael," Great! That’s great. Congratulations. Have fun signing my commission checks, boss.  				",6,15,95
Michael," No excuses Erin, come on! Make it happen.",6,15,95
Michael," Oh, yeah. Fine, fine. Leave it here. I have to make some sales anyway. Who should I call with my magic sales fingers? [Michael’s phone rings] Michael Scott, head of sales.",6,15,95
Michael," [on phone] It will be a pleasure doing business with you. Thanks, bye. [hangs up phone, blows train whistle] I just got a new account for the gentleman’s club in Carbondale. It is called “Curves.” I went by there the other day, saw some of the women walking in. Not really my cup of tea. Actually, Kevin, you might like it!",6,15,95
Michael, Why not? It’s part of the sales experience.,6,15,95
Michael, What is that smell? Do you smell that? What is that? Like a sulfur deposit under here?,6,15,95
Michael," No, I’m serious, we don’t have to put up… Is it the dogs?",6,15,95
Michael," You know what, we don’t have to deal with this. I am going to Google sulfur maps.",6,15,95
Michael," You know, it’s funny. I used to stand in here and wish I was out there. Now I’m out there, and I wish I was in here.",6,15,95
Michael, Yeah. Except there’s no grass out there. It’s just a farty dirt patch.,6,15,95
Michael, I really need my job back. We made a terrible mistake here.,6,15,95
Michael," We make a poster that says “Happy Opposite Day!” and she sees it on the way out… Nah, that’s stupid. Ugh! I wish we had one of those amnesia flashlights from Men in Black.",6,15,95
Michael," And weirdly I’m a good dog person, right guys? [dogs go to him] See? They love me.",6,15,95
Michael," Erin, what about my keyboard? [Erin hits a button on an electronic keyboard, playing a beat] Aw, so good to be home. How about a little Bosa Nova?",6,15,95
Michael,"  Oh, oh, oh!  Contraption!  She’s contrapting!  Okay, you know what?  I think I should drive you guys to the hospital, and here is why.  I am a licensed, classy driver in the state of Pennsylvania.  I gassed up the car…",6,16,96
Michael,"  Actually, I put diesel in this time, trying to save some money.",6,16,96
Michael,"  Happy to do it.  Also, I did a heck of a job baby-proofing this office.",6,16,96
Michael,"  Well, the baby was conceived here, so might as well live here a little bit, too.",6,16,96
Michael,"  Oh, yuck!  TMI!  How was it?  I don’t want to know.  Tell me later.  Let’s go!  Let’s go!  Hospital!",6,16,96
Michael,"  Shut up, Nick.  What a weird thing to say.  Weird I.T. nerd.  Don’t get revenge on me, nerd.",6,16,96
Michael,"  No, no, no, no, no.  You know what?  You can’t tell us what to do because you are not co-manager anymore.",6,16,96
Michael,"  Distractions are good!  That means conference room, five minutes!  No, no, five seconds!  Right now, right now!  Conference room!  Topic, potpourri!  Let’s go!  				",6,16,96
Michael,"  Um, I am sort of a master of distraction.  When I was a kid, my mom received compliments left and right from my teachers on how I was always able to distract others in class.  Try to think, what were the first thirteen colonies?  Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.  [Michael covers his mouth and makes fart noises.]  				",6,16,96
Michael,  The purpose for this meeting is to take Pam’s mind off of what’s going on inside of her body.,6,16,96
Michael,"  Does anybody have anything?  Anything interesting, any hobbies, uh, special skills?",6,16,96
Michael,"  [ as Pam shakes her head] Nope, nope, I don’t think anybody wants to see that.",6,16,96
Michael,"  [as Pam gives the thumbs up]  That sounds good!  Do you need some music, or…?  Okay.",6,16,96
Michael,"  [as Pam has another contraction]  Where are we?  We have every six minutes, ladies and gentlemen.  Another seventy five contractions and you are going to be there.",6,16,96
Michael,"  Yeah, happy times.  Come on.  Let’s have happy times.",6,16,96
Michael,"  Jim, as a matter of fact, I have printed out ten ways to induce labor.  And I’m thinking we just do the opposite of those things and we can slow down your labor.  Erin, read the first one.",6,16,96
Michael,"  Okay, nobody touch Pam’s nipples.  Think of Pam’s nipples as Toby’s grundle.",6,16,96
Michael,"  Pam, Pam!  Okay, alright, okay, it’s time.  Time to go to the hospital.  Somebody get Jim, please!  Is it midnight yet?",6,16,96
Michael,"  4:35.  Alright, almost made it.  Almost made it.  Too bad you didn’t have sex like seven and a half hours later.  But you had to have the afternoon delight.  I understand.  Sometimes you have to go for it.  Let’s go to the hospital, shall we?",6,16,96
Michael,  Oh.  What?  You want to eat cat food with Kevin and not go to the hospital?,6,16,96
Michael,"  Okay, okay, Jim.  I think this feast is over and it’s time to go to the hospital.",6,16,96
Michael,"  Let’s go, Pam.  Yeah, I think we should head out.",6,16,96
Michael,"  I know, I know, I know.  It went by too soon.",6,16,96
Michael,"  We’re okay, Jim!  Okay, Pamela.  You know what time it is?",6,16,96
Michael,  You’re not going to.  You know where you’re going?,6,16,96
Michael,"  Yes, you are.  And you know what you’re going to have?",6,16,96
Michael,  Yes!  We’re going to the hospital and we’re going to have a baby.  				,6,16,96
Michael,"  I got it!  I got it!  Everybody it’s go time!  At your stations.  Stanley, man the phones.  Meredith, please, get bottled water.  Erin, call an ambulance, please!",6,16,96
Michael,"  No, Jim, you are in no condition to drive.  I will drive you.  Check!  Got it.",6,16,96
Michael,  Go bag! Where’s my go bag?  Where’s my go bag?,6,16,96
Michael,"  You are telling me now that there is nothing in it.  Okay, great!  Oh, hey, hey, um, should I bring a dictionary to the hospital?",6,16,96
Michael,"  No, no, no.  Dwight, let Jim do that, please.",6,16,96
Michael,  [entering the elevator] Here we go!  Here we go!  On our way!,6,16,96
Michael,"  Come on, Stanley!  Okay.  We’re going now!",6,16,96
Michael,"  No, no, no, no!  Out, out!  Idiot.  				",6,16,96
Michael,"  Okay, just breathe…  She?  You found out?  Come on, guys.  I wanted to be surprised.",6,16,96
Michael,"  Guys, guys!  Stop fighting, come on.  Come on.  Do you want your kid to come out a lawyer?  Right?  Okay, you know what?  I am all over this.  Here we go.  [as he calls Dwight]  Ready?",6,16,96
Michael,"  Hello, Dwight.  Pam left her iPod at her house.  I want you to swing by, pick it up, and bring it to the hospital.  We need it yesterday.",6,16,96
Michael,"  Okay, alright.  [he parks in an ambulance zone]",6,16,96
Michael,  Dunder-Mifflin.  It’s okay.  [he throws the keys into bushes across the street]  I just did.  				,6,16,96
Michael,"  Where is my little nibblet?  Halpert, room D1.  Alright, family only beyond this point, thank you.  Here we go.",6,16,96
Michael,"  [looking horrified as he walks from the room back into the lobby]  Okay, not yet, not yet.  I’m going to go wash my eyes.  				",6,16,96
Michael,  That kid’s going to have a lot of hair.  				,6,16,96
Michael,  I think it’s going to be any minute now.,6,16,96
Michael,"  Phyllis, what could you possibly have to do?",6,16,96
Michael,"  Oh, my God.  Go, go, go!  Are you insane?  Alright.  				",6,16,96
Michael,"  [Pam screams as he approaches the door to their room]  Guys?  Hello?  Um, sorry to be a bother, but if we could have an ETA when this is gonna…",6,16,96
Michael,"  You’re starting, you’re kinda losing them.",6,16,96
Michael,"  [smoking a cigar]  Yeah, that’s right.  It’s a baby, see?",6,16,96
Michael,  Okay.  You can’t smoke anywhere these days.  				,6,16,96
Michael,"  Where’s the baby?  I want to see the baby.  Oh!  Oh, Helene, hi.  Oh, my goodness, what are the odds of this?  Congratulations on being a grandma.",6,16,96
Michael,"  Hello.  Oh, good for you.  I worry about you.",6,16,96
Michael,"  Mm-hmm.  Oh.  Ooh, wow.  Michael.  Michael.",6,16,96
Michael,"  There she sat.  Her name was Pam.  She was a receptionist.  She was engaged to an animal.  There sat Jim.  He was a gawky, tall salesman.  The odds of them getting together were insur-mountain-able.  I made a family!  I got these two together, and I made a family.",6,16,96
Michael,"  I am offering up my services to you all.  You saw what I did with Pam and Jim.  I can help you, too.",6,16,96
Michael,"  Okay, show of hands.  Who wants to live in a world where Stanley has two lovers and you don’t have any?  [Stanley raises his hand]  Who else?  Come on!  People, I know models!",6,16,96
Michael,"  Ha ha, you got that right!  Meredith?  Come on, you’re obviously single.",6,16,96
Michael,"  Well, when you least expect it, expect it.  I am going to fill the empty voids in your life with love.  I am going to fill that empty hole in your body with another person.  And, like Cupid, I am going to shoot you with love.  				",6,16,96
Michael,"  What would you say, if I told you that I was about to change your life?",6,16,96
Michael,  I would like you to meet your new boyfriend.,6,16,96
Michael,"  Okay, hold on.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  You got to let the cookies cool before you pop ’em in your mouth.  Why don’t you guys get to know each other?  Maybe have lunch together?",6,16,96
Michael,"  I’m not so sure.  Kevin has an enormous heart.  Literally, he has an elephant heart.  He had a transplant when he was seventeen.  Had some problems, blah blah blah.",6,16,96
Michael,"  No, Kevin doesn’t have an elephant heart.  But he is very sensitive.  And it won’t kill Erin just to go and have lunch with him in the break room like I promised him…  I bet his heart is enlarged, though.  				",6,16,96
Michael,  Just don’t let him sit on you…  I’m kidding.  You’ll have fun.  It’ll be good.  It’ll be good.  There he is.  Go to him.,6,16,96
Michael,  Kevin.  Erin would like a few words with you.,6,16,96
Michael,"  Oh, my God, this is agonizing.  Look, Kevin, do you really think that you could have dated Erin?",6,16,96
Michael,"  Okay, even if someone told you that, you should know that that could never be possible, Kevin.  And I’m surprised that you didn’t question me in the first place.",6,16,96
Michael,"  This isn’t about me, and that is debatable.  And I have a personality, where as you…  Yes, Andy?",6,16,96
Michael,"  [smoking a cigar]  There is no greater feeling than when two people who are perfect for each other overcome all obstacles, and find true love.  And that is what I thought that Erin and Kevin were going to find today…  I think I’m going to be sick…  				",6,16,96
Michael," It is St. Patrick’s Day, and here in Scranton that is a huge deal. It is the closest that the Irish will ever get to Christmas.  				",6,17,97
Michael, It is. This is a little something for you to remember your time here in Scranton by.,6,17,97
Michael," No, no no- that is a good gift actually. Buildings here in Scranton are literally powered by coal.",6,17,97
Michael," When you work for Sabre, only one thing matters. And I don’t care if you’re a loser, or you practice bestiality, if Jo likes you, you are in. And I am in!  				",6,17,97
Michael," Daryl. Mellow, soulful, smart for warehouse…",6,17,97
Michael," Look at that picture that you drew. Nice job! We’re very proud of you. You know what, we’re gonna tape that up on the refrigerator in the kitchen.",6,17,97
Michael," Oh no! Say it’s not so, Jo, we’re gonna miss you, we’re gonna miss you so much!",6,17,97
Michael, How about July 4th weekend? [Reveals paper ticket],6,17,97
Michael," You know what, in the spirit of full disclosure, I have actually reserved a bunch of different seats on a bunch of different flights, but there are a couple of flights that only have two tickets left, so I think we should pull the trigger and –",6,17,97
Michael," All right, everybody, just try to put a brave face on.  				",6,17,97
Michael, Let’s follow the chain of events. Jo likes Michael. Jo invites Michael to house. Jo doesn’t like Michael anymore. Hmmm.  				,6,17,97
Michael," Hello. I want you to stop what you’re doing right now. You are stressed, and I’m taking you to lunch.",6,17,97
Michael," All right. Well if you need me, I’ll be on the other side of that wall. Knock once for yes, twice for no.",6,17,97
Michael," A real Hoop Dreams story you got there. Oh man, you seem to have caught Jo’s eye. How’d you make that happen?",6,17,97
Michael," How do I put this delicately? Does her family owe your family something, in terms of a past injustice?",6,17,97
Michael, Hey there. So I think I’m done. Gonna head out. Unless you want to chat. Like we were doing earlier.,6,17,97
Michael," Mm? Well, the clock says chatting time, so. ",6,17,97
Michael," No, no, no. That’s super-clear-ish. [Exits, closes door, takes off coat.] Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope.  				",6,17,97
Michael," Ah damn. That sounds great. Unfortunately I am stuck here, because my boss is making us work late.",6,17,97
Michael, Why does she do that? Why doesn’t she just tell you what your schedule is?,6,17,97
Michael," Do I really want to turn out like Gabe? Twenty-six. Single. Tied to my desk. No life, no family. I want to have been married by the time I would’ve turned thirty. That’s just – that’s just depressing.  				",6,17,97
Michael," There is, as a matter of fact. It’s getting sorta late. It’s 8:30. And it’s St. Patrick’s Day, which is a world ethnic holiday. So I have decided I’m going to dismiss my employees.",6,17,97
Michael," I’m thrilled with the work they’ve done today, both quality and the quantity. Great performance, Very, very solid all the way around. ",6,17,97
Michael," Okay. Happy St. Patrick’s Day. [Starts to leave office] And also, I would like to say that I will be canceling my trip down to Tallahassee. Although I do look forward to our professional relationship.",6,17,97
Michael," Did I mess up my career today? My future prospects at Sabre? I don’t know. There is a chance. Yes. I tell you I love my job. But Jo wants me to put on a show for her, and pretend to work late?  Nah. I spent all day, trying to make her like me, and I forgot to ask myself something:",6,17,97
Michael," Okay. Okay, all right. Best night ever. [Meredith joins behind Packer] What the hell is going on back there?  				",6,17,97
Michael," Look at him. Look at him – t-shirt, jeans…",6,18,98
Michael, [laughs] I am flattered. That’s Johnny Depp.,6,18,98
Michael," I am flipping out, man. I mean, you remember my idea for the fourth Pirates movie.",6,18,98
Michael," [feigning accent] Hey, Jim, Jim – where, where do I find the Black Pearl? ",6,18,98
Michael," Captain Jack Sparrow. Captain Jack Sparrow, Jim. ",6,18,98
Michael," Okay, okay. Screw you, Halpert. You know, it’s not easy getting excited about stuff. Remember how you felt when you thought you’d seen Roger Clemens?",6,18,98
Michael, I know! It also explains why the name on his mailbox was M Shulman.,6,18,98
Michael," [speaking at a staff meeting] First up, the lost and found has gone missing. It itself is lost, so please, try not to lose anything until we find it. Ah, pet day. If you don’t have a pet, please don’t feel like – ",6,18,98
Michael," Ah, yes, the leads. The leads that Sabre has spent $50,000 to get from a market research company… are not here yet. But will be.. [muttering, people rise to leave] No, no, meeting’s not over.",6,18,98
Michael," I would like your undivided attention, please.",6,18,98
Michael," Over the last few weeks, things have been changing here. Sabre says it is our duty to support the sales team and the salesmen are letting it go to their heads. I think it’s kind of screwed up, because the way this place used to work was:",6,18,98
Michael," Wow, wowie wowie. Congratulations. It’s a big cheque. [Jim stands in corner, texting]",6,18,98
Michael, Stop sexting Pam. I’m trying to congratulate you.,6,18,98
Michael, Okay. Don’t gloat. Here’s the thing. This kind of money can corrupt people. ,6,18,98
Michael, Honey and jelly sandwich time. [removes lunch from fridge],6,18,98
Michael," Oh, you got to be kidding me. [holds up squashed sandwich] Look at that. That’s – ",6,18,98
Michael, You saw who did this and you didn’t stop them?,6,18,98
Michael, The sales department smashed my sandwich. ,6,18,98
Michael," Alright. Then I guess I should give them out. Hold on. You know what I’m thinking? I’m thinking that I have something that you want. You guys are acting like you own this place. And you don’t. Not even Sabre owns this place. It’s a rental. I’m kind of sick of the attitude around here. I’m sick of the cocky walk, I am sick of you throwing your paycheck in my face, I am sick of your uppity attitude, Jim… I think I am not going to give these to you. [Angela, Kevin and Oscar applaud]",6,18,98
Michael," Then we are just rewarding their bad behaviour. Okay. Just – imagine that instead of going to jail for murdering someone, you got an ice-cream cone. If that were the case, then in the summertime, everyone would go around killing people for the pleasure of an ice-cream cone.",6,18,98
Michael," Hmm. Well, if that is what I am required to do, I will do exactly that. ",6,18,98
Michael," Hello. May I have everyone’s attention, please? Gabe has instructed me to hand out the leads, so I’m going to give the leads to… King Creed! [hands him a lead]",6,18,98
Michael, – and to King Meredith! [hands her a lead],6,18,98
Michael, And to King Angela! [hands her a lead] Because today we are all kings. And queens [pats Oscar’s shoulder]. ,6,18,98
Michael," I’m giving them the leads, Phyllis.   				",6,18,98
Michael," Oh, right, those are clues. And within each clue is a lesson. You learn a lesson, and then you find a lead. The leads are scattered all over the industrial park. I am trying to make your kids respect you. Because a father needs to respect his boss, and kids don’t respect the father who doesn’t respect the boss. Do you understand that line of logic?",6,18,98
Michael, Today I turned an office crisis into a teachable moment. [cuts to Jim fishing one of the leads out of a catering size tin of Ravioli] A lesser manager would have screwed this day up royally [clue next to Jim reads:,6,18,98
Michael," Well, bigshot, ‘If you want to find your leads, go to the man who never breathes’. ",6,18,98
Michael," Oh my god. Oh my god [takes off running] oh my god, no, no no, hey, hey [chases after garbage van] wait, wait!  				",6,18,98
Michael," Okay. You know what, let’s just go to the dump, start looking – Ryan, c’mon, shotgun in my car – ",6,18,98
Michael," Why? Because I am not going to call Sabre and say, ‘Hi, you know those very valuable expensive leads that you gave us earlier today? Well, because of a screw-up by a staff member, they’re now in the city dump.”",6,18,98
Michael," Well, that’s not the way it’s going t sound. Here’s what we’re going to do. We’ll go to the dump, we’ll look around, then we’ll all go out and get pizza, maybe catch a movie, late-night drink, some more pizza, call it a night. What do you – ",6,18,98
Michael," Okay, no, you encouraged it. You were complicit [looks to Jim for vocab-reassurance] Complicit. You were all successories!",6,18,98
Michael," Okay fine, I get it. I’ll just go by myself.",6,18,98
Michael," You know, Dwight, there was a time when you’d be pinching yourself to have the opportunity to look through a dump with me.",6,18,98
Michael," Yeah. Sometimes the acorn just stays the acorn. If you don’t believe me, look in my gutters.   				",6,18,98
Michael," [kicking through rubbish at the dump] You’ve changed, man.",6,18,98
Michael," Since when do you care about money? When I first met you, you were a wide-eyed innocent.",6,18,98
Michael," No, I’m talking about your personality, Dwight.",6,18,98
Michael, You think you would have done better without me? Really?,6,18,98
Michael, Wow. Ohhhkay. Man. When I think about all the time I wasted being your friend – I shouldn’t have been hanging out watching karate movies with you – ,6,18,98
Michael," You know what, I should have been doing? I should have been out at bars, finding my soul-mate, finding my wife, making babies – ",6,18,98
Michael,"  That’s my wife you’re talking about, man.",6,18,98
Michael," If I wanted to hit you, I would have hit you. ",6,18,98
Michael," No no. You just made an enemy with the wrong guy, Dwight. [they throw volleys of rubbish at each other] No, time out, time out. [Michael inspects a box, then hurls it at Dwight] Time in!",6,18,98
Michael," Don’t even think about that [Dwight begins rolling it towards Michael, as he reaches him Dwight kicks it and falls backward. The spool comes to a halt in front of Michael, and Michael pushes it towards Dwight.]",6,18,98
Michael," Okay, Dwight. Here we go [picks up a sink, spills dump juice on his pants] oh god.",6,18,98
Michael," We’re never going to find those leads, are we? [they both sit on the edge of a claw-footed bathtub]",6,18,98
Michael, This [picks up racquet] Why would somebody throw that out?  ,6,18,98
Michael," Yeah, she does – she loves purple. [Dwight sniffs it] Does it stink?",6,18,98
Michael," Know what would be a great picture here? Just this whole dump, and in the middle, one flower. That’s it. And the caption would read:",6,18,98
Michael,"Oh, yeah, sitting on your big fat butt. Alright, that is the number to beat.",6,19,99
Michael,"My respect. [everyone returns to work] Okay, I’ll make it a little more interesting. Anyone who does more than 25 push-ups –",6,19,99
Michael,"Gets to go home. [everyone starts to do push-ups] Ooh! I say ‘dance,’ they say ‘how high?’ Here we go. Oh, no. No, no, no. Butt to high. [steps on Angela] Disqualified!",6,19,99
Michael,"[Stanley straining and breathing heavily] Oh, wow, that is adorable!",6,19,99
Michael,"Alright, alright. [chanting continues]  				",6,19,99
Michael,"Well, it’s not exactly fair. He’s got all of his weight that’s helping him go down.  				",6,19,99
Michael,"Ladies and gentleman, it is quitting time. ",6,19,99
Michael,"Oh, wow, I cannot believe this is happening. This is everything I dreamed. Oh, my God! [laughs]",6,19,99
Michael,"It’s not a birthday, it’s not a good-bye party…",6,19,99
Michael,What is a nice girl like you hanging out with these bums for? [Julie laughs]  				,6,19,99
Michael,"Oh, no, no. Pam and Jim work for me. And if they win, they are fired.",6,19,99
Michael,"No. No, not really. Not really, but they better not win.",6,19,99
Michael,"See, I didn’t think you could teach that. I thought that was something you were born with. What am I thinking right now?",6,19,99
Michael,Yes. I feel like an idiot. Awesome.   				,6,19,99
Michael,"[removing tie] Well, apparently, Michael Scott is on a date. And that, that my friend, changes everything. [puts on backwards golf cap]  				",6,19,99
Michael,"Guys, come on, I’m on a date. Let me do my thang.  				",6,19,99
Michael,"Hi, I’m date Mike. Nice to meet me. How do you like your eggs in the morning? [tries to wink]  				",6,19,99
Michael,"Hey, guys, guys, guys. [steals a cherry from waitress passing buy] Watch this. Ready?",6,19,99
Michael,I’m tying a knot in the stem with my tongue.,6,19,99
Michael,"[choking] Wow. Oh, wow, that was close.   				",6,19,99
Michael,"I would say I kind of have an unfair advantage because I watch reality dating shows like a hawk, and I learn. I absorb information from the strategies of the winners and the losers. Actually, I probably learn more from the losers.   				",6,19,99
Michael,"Yeah, why don’t you send the bill to 23 I Don’t Care Lane, Scranton, Pennsylvania?",6,19,99
Michael,"Hey, she can tell I’m on a date, right? Right? I’m just having fun.",6,19,99
Michael,"Okay, all right. Okay, whoa. I’m just kidding around. I’m sorry. ",6,19,99
Michael,"You let somebody talk to you like that, where does it stop?",6,19,99
Michael,"Hey, you embarrassed my friends in front of me and I’m gonna need you to go back over to the table and apologize. ",6,19,99
Michael,I am here with my employees. I am here on a date. Hello.,6,19,99
Michael,"Well, it just so happens that I am a manager too. And the way I manage people is that I touch their hearts and souls with humor, with love and maybe a dash of razzle-dazzle. And I don’t see that from you. ",6,19,99
Michael,Yes it is. I am writing a book about it.,6,19,99
Michael,"If you’re really interested, it’s called ‘Somehow I Manage’ and there’s going to be a picture of me on the cover, shrugging, with my sleeves rolled up.",6,19,99
Michael,"Read it? I own it. But no, I have not read it.",6,19,99
Michael,I manage a paper company-Dunder Mifflin/Sabre. ,6,19,99
Michael,"Hey, Julie! You having fun? [Julie leaves]",6,19,99
Michael,"Halperts, wait up. Oh, what a great night. Got to hang out with my peeps. Sort of did okay with a new young lady. ",6,19,99
Michael,"I think I did. But I can’t take all of the credit. Some of the credit is due, in fact, to my good friend, Date Mike. Nice to meet me.   				",6,19,99
Michael, Okay. All right. All right. Okay. I’ll take her to lunch.,6,20,100
Michael," [walks over to Erin’s desk] Hi, Erin. Happy Secretary’s Day. ",6,20,100
Michael, I wanted to know what your plans for lunch were because I was hoping to ask you to…[Erin snaps a picture of Michael] lunch.,6,20,100
Michael," Well, Hayworth’s is more business casual, and they always screw up your order. So I’m…",6,20,100
Michael," Okay, well, we’ll figure something. [Michael turns and starts back toward his office]",6,20,100
Michael," [looks at Andy who is urging he agree with her, Michael turns around] Okay, let’s go to Hayworth’s.",6,20,100
Michael, [in his car with Erin driving to lunch] Would you mind if I listen to my book on tape? I’m kind of a bookworm. This is the novelization of the movie Precious based on the book Push by Sapphire. ,6,20,100
Michael, I’ve been trying. I’ve been trying to keep it going. Erin is just weird.   				,6,20,100
Michael," Well, let’s see. Um… Andy. Plays the banjo.",6,20,100
Michael," Other than the fact that he dated Angela, I don’t think he is a snappy dresser.",6,20,100
Michael, I don’t think he is the best dresser.  Reminds me of Easter.,6,20,100
Michael, I don’t know. Probably didn’t want you to have a mental image of him having sex with somebody else. ,6,20,100
Michael," They were engaged, so… [Erin looks shocked] Okay, you know what, sir?",6,20,100
Michael," Yeah, I asked for pickles with my burger. And there are only, like five or six. Could I get some more pickles?",6,20,100
Michael, What are you doing? What are you doing?,6,20,100
Michael," Okay, okay. You know what? You know what? You know what? Everybody’s looking at you right now. ",6,20,100
Michael, [turns to other restaurant patrons] I’ll have what she’s having!  				,6,20,100
Michael, [in Michael’s car] Did you have a… did you like your lunch? Did you have a good lunch? Did you like that? Did you enjoy your food? It was good. I liked my lunch.   				,6,20,100
Michael," You know what, I think we can all agree that Angela’s not so great, so..",6,20,100
Michael," Andy, she’s not the easiest person in the world to have a conversation with. All right? And besides, who doesn’t tell their girlfriend that they were engaged to someone who works four feet away from them? That’s like.. that’s like Mr. and Mrs. Smith crap.",6,20,100
Michael," You know what, I resent the implication that I would keep that secret. Everyone here knows that I can’t and won’t keep a secret.  				",6,20,100
Michael," No, no, I was just watching Cookie Monster. It finally downloaded. Mind if I sit down?",6,20,100
Michael, Oh. Yep. I’m sorry about that. I feel… I’m sorry I caused that thing. ,6,20,100
Michael," Well, yeah, yes. But I still feel sorry. You know what, I wouldn’t worry about Angela. She doesn’t hold a candle to you, Erin. She’s old enough to be your mom for one thing. And she’s, like, three feet tall. And she wears pioneer women clothing. And I don’t think she’s ever pooped in her life. And Andy, you know, come on. Andy, his butt looks big in those khakis. ",6,20,100
Michael," Ahh! You said it! You know who you would love? Oh, this guy in my neighborhood, Tom Dizemore. This is him:",6,20,100
Michael," [walking up] Oh, oh, I was just watching that. Did you do that, man? “Oscar. I am the Count.” Nailed him. Nailed him. [Gives Kevin a fist pump] Good work Cookie Monster.",6,20,100
Michael," No, no, no, no. Solamente en espanol, por favor.  				",6,21,101
Michael," I believe that every man, woman, and child in this country should learn how to speak Spanish. They are our neighbors to the South, and this would be a healing thing for… for all of North America. And… I am going on vacation next week to Cancun.  				",6,21,101
Michael," [clears throat] Oh. Eso es lo que dice, el!",6,21,101
Michael, Can you smell the power of the Halperts? Power couple.,6,21,101
Michael, I went with the people I thought would put the best face on the company. ,6,21,101
Michael," There’s this woman I met a few weeks ago. Her name is Donna, the manager of Sid & Dexter’s and, right now, we’re in the midst of a passionate love affair. Um, no. But she is coming by today. Maybe to buy some printers, so…   				",6,21,101
Michael," Right here, we have the wonder twins, Jim and Pam Halpert. They will be assisting you today. ",6,21,101
Michael," Sorry to interrupt. Sorry to interrupt. Do you, Donna, by any chance shop at Victoria’s Secret?",6,21,101
Michael, Because I keep getting these magazines sent to me via the address of the woman who used to live in my condo before me.,6,21,101
Michael," Uh, yes, uh, the sale is on now through May.",6,21,101
Michael," I took the liberty to scan a few things earlier, and I want to show you… there we go! [Michael’s picture pops up on the PowerPoint screen] Whoa, look at those vivid colors. Look at my eyes. Those are Shrek-green eyes. That is me again. I think this displays the crisp, dazzling white. ",6,21,101
Michael," And that would be a display [image from a catalog of a man wearing only white boxers pops up] of the crisp, gorgeous black.",6,21,101
Michael," It’s subtle. That’s how it works. I show her an image that turns her on. 	And then she looks at me, then back at me, then back at the image. Soon, she doesn’t know what is me, what is the image. She just knows that she’s turned on.   				",6,21,101
Michael, This is a place that I like to go to be alone with my thoughts. I’ve never taken anybody there before.,6,21,101
Michael, And that’s it. That’s me. That’s who I am. ,6,21,101
Michael," Oh, thanks. [softly] You’re not bad, either. ",6,21,101
Michael, Jim! Could you come in here for a sec? What was that printer we were looking at?   				,6,21,101
Michael," [in his office] You didn’t see it, Pam. She was giving me all sorts of signals that she wanted me to make a move. Shortbread?",6,21,101
Michael," Oh really, Jim? What about Pam? And you did a heck of a lot more than kiss. Maybe this could be my Pam. ",6,21,101
Michael," Look, I know that I screwed up in there. I know that I probably messed up your sale. I just want to go in and fix it. ",6,21,101
Michael," So maybe we could find a little wiggle room, right? ",6,21,101
Michael, I think we could. [Donna giggles]  				,6,21,101
Michael," Okay, well sometimes… sometimes it makes financial sense to lose money, right? Like for tax purposes.",6,21,101
Michael, So corporate approval of this contract is contingent upon buyer and seller… ,6,21,101
Michael, Operating blahdy blahdy blah. Boilerplate. Pound of fish. [Donna laughing] Just kidding. Do you like mints?,6,21,101
Michael, I carry mints with me sometimes. You ever tried those?,6,21,101
Michael," Okay, guys, guys, guys. Just tell me it’s not totally insane to try one more time.",6,21,101
Michael," No, guys, guys, guys. Guys, just… thank you for talking. Wish me luck.",6,21,101
Michael," What sort of movie would Rudy have been if he had just stopped, given up, after two rejections? Would have been a lot shorter. Probably been a lot funnier. But it would have ultimately been a disappointment. I still would have seen it, but that’s not… the point.  				",6,21,101
Michael, We should have your contract done by Thursday. ,6,21,101
Michael," Yeah it was nice to do business with you, too.",6,21,101
Michael," [follows her out of office] Ahem. So, um… okay, if you have… if there’s any other questions that you have… ",6,21,101
Michael, I don’t know. I don’t know. Can’t really trust my feelings anymore. ,6,21,101
Michael, Okay. Maybe she wants me to return this to her at her work. ,6,21,101
Michael, Yeah. This could be a signal. People don’t just take barrettes off. ,6,21,101
Michael," I know. You’re right. Thank you. Thanks everybody. [waves, returns to his office, clears throat, turns around and runs out of office]",6,21,101
Michael, Oh. You’re still here. I have your baguette.  				,6,21,101
Michael, You know what? Everybody told me that you weren’t interested. Everybody. And I didn’t believe ’em. And they were right. So… there’s your barrette. ,6,21,101
Michael," Really?! Oh, that’s great. That’s such good news. I did it! [all look at him] I kissed. We kissed. ",6,21,101
Michael," No, I’m serious. It… this happened. I went down to the parking lot and I was… I returned her barrette [holds up barrette] We ki… We did. Okay. We did. We did.   				",6,21,101
Michael, You know what? It doesn’t matter. Because I know it happened. And that is all that counts. [shouts] I did do it!  				,6,21,101
Michael," Ooh! Things with Donna are so… oh-ho-ho! They’re going great. I, uh… we’re just clicking on every level. Emotionally and sexually and… orally and I am not used to relationships going this well. I’m actually having trouble focusing on my job. And I like it!  				",6,22,102
Michael," Who enjoys the weekends? [all raise hands] Of course. Now the weekend is always great if you have someone, which I do. I have Donna. She is hot. She has a Pilates butt. But we need to find something to do this weekend beside have sex. Did I say that? Yes, I did. [all nod] And the reason you are here is that I need ideas for things that Donna and I could do on the weekend.  So just shout it out.",6,22,102
Michael," Okay, you get out of here, big dog. [high-fives Stanley] Ah, no, no, no, no. You guys sit down. I need ideas.",6,22,102
Michael," Yeah, well, Stanley doesn’t help with anything. Come on. Shout ’em out, shout ’em out. ",6,22,102
Michael," We actually went to the Poconos last Tuesday. We headed up there, we went to a little Chinese bistro, um, P.F. Chang’s. ",6,22,102
Michael," Because when your super-hot girlfriend says, “I wanna go to Mount Pocono,” you go to Mount Pocono and you do her. And we screwed. Whoops. TMI. ",6,22,102
Michael," You know what, Kelly? This is the real world. Not The Real World:",6,22,102
Michael," All right.  [all stand up to leave] And she won’t say, “I love you.”",6,22,102
Michael, Nine dates. I said it on the second date. ,6,22,102
Michael," Well, that’s easy for you to say. You have a bad imagination. It’s stupid. I live in a fantasy world. ",6,22,102
Michael," Yes, Jim, I do. And I can’t stay in a relationship that is full of lies and deceit. ",6,22,102
Michael," Ever since I found out that Donna might be cheating on me, I have not eaten or slept. This not knowing, that’s what’s killing me.   				",6,22,102
Michael, [whispers] I want someone to follow Donna. I want her tailed. I need the name of a good private investigator. ,6,22,102
Michael," It’s never too early for ice cream, Jim. But we didn’t have any ice cream, so this is mayonnaise and black olives. ",6,22,102
Michael," It’s comfort food, all right? [disgustedly] God. ",6,22,102
Michael," I know. Well, I hope you’re right. We’ll see what Dwight says. ",6,22,102
Michael, Because I have him investigating her. I’m waiting for a text update.,6,22,102
Michael, It’s too late to undo it. I need to know. Otherwise this thing is going to spiral out of amok. ,6,22,102
Michael," That’s not true. [Pam stares him down] You’re right, I ruin everything. And I’ve known some wonderful women. Holly, Carol, Jan.",6,22,102
Michael," Oh, yeah. Yes, yes. Yes. All of, all of the greatest loves of my life. ",6,22,102
Michael, [sighs] All right. [calls Dwight]  				,6,22,102
Michael," Okay. Well, I am just glad this is all over. ",6,22,102
Michael, I am not paying for that membership.   				,6,22,102
Michael," [sitting on the floor behind Erin’s desk, sighs] Ohhh… mmm… ",6,22,102
Michael," No, I like the attention. Is she here yet? ",6,22,102
Michael," Mm-hmm. Right. Right. Right. [Michael pretends to be speaking on the phone as Donna approaches] Okay, I’ll talk to you later.   				",6,22,102
Michael, I didn’t. Everybody else here did. Everybody convinced me that something was up. They poisoned my mind.,6,22,102
Michael," Ye… pfff. Well, no. It’s a lie. That’s not what happened. I just like you. I can’t believe I get to be with you. You work at an adult arcade. You could have any man you want. ",6,22,102
Michael," If you wanna dump me, I totally get it. ",6,22,102
Michael," Well, you are boner-ific. [Donna laughs]",6,22,102
Michael," Oh, my God, Vero Beach. No. Is that on the water?",6,22,102
Michael, Wow. [Pam knocks on Michaels door and goes in] That’s exciting.,6,22,102
Michael," Oh, my God. Look at how cheap street level rooms are. Am I the only person who enjoys people watching?",6,22,102
Michael," Yeah, I just remembered that I have to go to the bathroom. Pam?",6,22,102
Michael, God! Lowest of the low. That guy. Just a notch above Toby. You know what?,6,22,102
Michael," I’m gonna kill him. No, I’m not. I feel… I… no, I’m not going to kill him. ",6,22,102
Michael, I need to have her tell me herself. Right? ,6,22,102
Michael," I need to say, “What the hell is that? What the hell is that?”",6,22,102
Michael, You know what? We should really do something fun this week. ,6,22,102
Michael, I can’t do Thursday. Book club. How about Friday?,6,22,102
Michael," Oh, really? ’cause I was thinking we could go to this concert. Spice Girls are opening for Weird Al. Front row. It’d be a great, great concert. ",6,22,102
Michael, You’re cheating. You’re cheating on me. ,6,22,102
Michael," Pam told me. [looks up at 2nd floor windows and so does Donna; Jim, Dwight, and Pam are visible on conference room window, they all scramble as soon as Donna and Michael look up, Pam throwing herself on the floor]",6,22,102
Michael, The other man. Who’s the guy? Who is it? ,6,22,102
Michael,"  You’re kidding me? God! You say radon is silent, but deadly, and then you expect me not to make farting noises with my mouth? What is this?",6,23,103
Michael,"  You know what? We’re not gonna die of radon, we’re gonna die of boredom.",6,23,103
Michael,"  Right? And if I had a gun with two bullets and I was in a room with Hitler, Bin Laden, and Toby, I would shoot Toby twice.",6,23,103
Michael,"  Yes, we stab Toby through the heart with an icicle.",6,23,103
Michael,"  Oh, thank you. It’s reversible, I think. [everyone laughs]",6,23,103
Michael,"  Oh! Oh wow, are those Eagles’ flavors? Cake it to the Limit. That’s my favorite! I love that! Too much for me to have by myself. Anybody wanna share?",6,23,103
Michael,  Okay. Well… that’s random. I will dig into those later.  				,6,23,103
Michael,"  Okay, well, I’ll have to take a rain check, but thanks for the offer.",6,23,103
Michael,"  Okay, Pam… she’s not invisible so stop asking silly questions.",6,23,103
Michael,  Since when is this an office where we delve into each other’s personal lives?  				,6,23,103
Michael,"  I like Donna. Is it wrong to keep seeing her? Depends on who you ask. I mean, if you ask her husband… or you took a random poll, yeah, it’s wrong.  				",6,23,103
Michael,"  Well, I think we all know what you’re capable of Meredith.",6,23,103
Michael,"  People, this is Scranton. And many people consider that to be the Paris of northeastern Pennsylvania. And in Paris, it is rude for a woman to have less than four lovers.",6,23,103
Michael,"  I will have you know that I asked Donna about this and she is fine with it. And just to be sure, I asked her again afterward. Same answer.",6,23,103
Michael,  He is never gonna find out. He is a high school baseball coach. He wakes up early. He goes to bed early. Look at how long it took for him to find out. [points to Andy] It was right under his nose. I had to tell him.,6,23,103
Michael,"  I’m sorry, it… why is it okay for Stanley to cheat or for Phyllis to cheat…",6,23,103
Michael,  On her diet! He’s a sports guy. He’s scummy. Dogfighting. Drugs. They spit.,6,23,103
Michael,  You know what? You know what? I am declaring a moment of silence right now. Ten minutes of silence honoring Michael Jackson. just sit there and think about Michael jackson.  				,6,23,103
Michael,"  Mm, no, when are you people going to stop casting the first stone? I am not in the wrong here. I am the good guy. ",6,23,103
Michael,  Do you think this husband is a super sweet nice guy? Do you think he’s an angel? I don’t think so. Why is his wife going off and having a little something-something with me? There has to be a problem with him. ,6,23,103
Michael,  Let’s go. [starts walking towards the elevator] I can’t wait to see this jerk who is making me cheat on his wife. I should punch him in the nose for what he’s making me do to her.   				,6,23,103
Michael,"  Shh! Try not to draw attention, please. That’s him. That’s him.",6,23,103
Michael,"  Right there. Look, look. Follow my finger. Okay? see? The grownup by the base? ",6,23,103
Michael,"  All right. Can you just– can you just act normal for a second, please?",6,23,103
Michael,  You have no idea what you’re talking about.,6,23,103
Michael,"  You don’t know. You don’t– you don’t know anything. Look at him. Look at him over there. High-fiving? He didn’t even do anything. Kid did all the work. I bet he does that at home. I bet it’s like, “Hey, Donna, why don’t you wash the dishes?” “High-five, Donna.” “Hey, why don’t you bring me my slippers?” “Hi-five. I’m taking all the credit.”",6,23,103
Michael,"  Okay, well, that’s because he’s paying their salary. ",6,23,103
Michael,"  I know, I know, I know. It–I’m–it– that was a euphemism.  				",6,23,103
Michael,"  Well, that was not at all what I expected. Hoo hoo! Whoo. My heart’s still racing. I just looked a man in the eyes and I shook his hand. All the time I was thinking, “I’m sleeping with your wife.” And you know who does that? James freakin’ Bond.  				",6,23,103
Michael,  Don’t thank me. Thank Dylan’s mom. Here you go! Oh! Ooh Hoo Hoo Hoo hoo!,6,23,103
Michael,"  Uh, no, they didn’t say team. They just said coal Hawks. ",6,23,103
Michael,"  Well, then it wouldn’t be the first time I stole something away from Coach Shane. ",6,23,103
Michael,"  I am what I am, Oscar. And I want what I want. And right now, I want a piece of cake. From now on, when I’m hungry, I am going to eat whatever I am hungry for. ",6,23,103
Michael,"  I don’t care. I have an appetite for life! [eats cake] Mmm. Mmm! Oh, god. That’s Lemon.",6,23,103
Michael,"  You’ll learn, baby. You’ll learn.  				",6,23,103
Michael,"  Okay. [Phyllis avoids looking at Michael] Phyllis. Okay. Look at me. [continues to look away] Phyllis, look at– [Phyllis turns to leave] okay, that’s… [chases after her] All right, all right. You know what? I’m sick of this. I’m sick of the little disapproving head shakes. If you think that’s going to have any effect on me, it will not. I am going to leave right now and go to a motel to meet Donna.",6,23,103
Michael,"  Because a motel is dirty and it is sexy. Like me. And like Donna. And frankly, the stuff that we’re into isn’t very condo-appropriate.",6,23,103
Michael,"  Okay, Morgan Freeman-narrating-everything.",6,23,103
Michael,  Nobody better try to stop me. Good. [leaves the office. door closes],6,23,103
Michael,"  [driving in car; returns to office; grabs ice cream out of freezer] How do I feel about breaking up with Donna? Good. Moral. I feel proud. [beeping; cut to Donna who is waiting in the parking lot of the motel] Like a grownup.[Donna receives text from phone] That was not easy because I really liked her a lot. And I’m a little bit emotional right now because I know that I absolutely made the right decision. [Donna has disappointed look; cut back to Michael in his office opening ice cream] At the end of the day, we have to do what’s right. And it was either living with myself or… being happy. And I picked… the… former.  				",6,23,103
Michael,"  [sighs] Umm… I have done some very bad things, things of which I am not proud. I would like to publicly apologize to… the coach and the players. And I vow to never listen to my bodily instincts ever again.",6,23,103
Michael,  Oh. Okay. I was talking about… what do– what? What’s going on?  				,6,23,103
Michael," OH! Pack Man, I thought you were a girl!  				",6,24,104
Michael," Apparently, there are allegations that Sabre printers can cause a fire. So they asked me to give a statement to the press. I’m like, what? All right. So I do it. It’s on TV last night. And it’s in the paper today. And it’s online. And then I call Froggy 98.7, the request line. I talk to the host about it on the air. It’s like, come on, people, enough.  				",6,24,104
Michael," Everybody, we are at DEFCON 5. I am officially the second-most watched clip of the day on the WBRE news site.",6,24,104
Michael," Oh, that teacher who was wrongfully accused of being a pedophile. Now, we cannot let the pedophile win again! I would like you all to go to the website and watch my clip eleven times. ",6,24,104
Michael, Yes. Come on! Get it up! That’s what… let’s do it!,6,24,104
Michael," Really? A baby otter? Okay, um, count me in as who cares. It’s not even that interesting a baby otter, it can’t even stand up. [looks toward computer] It’s trying to stand up… [choking up] there it goes.  				",6,24,104
Michael," Jo, Jo, I can assure you it was no one in this office.",6,24,104
Michael," Absolutely. Anyone who talked to the press, please raise your hand.",6,24,104
Michael," There is no reason for anyone here to sign this, because I know everything there is to know about these people. I know when their birthdays are, I know what their favorite kind of cake is, I know what color streamers they like… ",6,24,104
Michael," Yes, yes, but it shows a bigger picture.",6,24,104
Michael," We should give him a one-way ticket to Montego Bay, where they keep all the al-Qaeda. ",6,24,104
Michael," Yes. You put them in jail for a long time, you put them in jail for as long as you can. ",6,24,104
Michael," I want these people to really pay, I want them to suffer. I’d prefer it if they died, ’cause it’s not right.",6,24,104
Michael," Ridiculous, Angela. And like I’m going to believe one of his spermed lovers.",6,24,104
Michael, Is there something that you would like to say to me?,6,24,104
Michael," That’s a little much. All right, all right, all right.",6,24,104
Michael, Did you tell anyone outside of this office that the printers were catching on fire?,6,24,104
Michael," I basically swore up and down that none of my employees did it, and then I find out that one of my best ones did. And now he’s probably going to get fired for it. And if that is not poetic justice, I don’t know what is.  				",6,24,104
Michael," I don’t know what the best plan is, Pam. Oh god… my mind is going a mile an hour. ",6,24,104
Michael, Two whistleblowers… two! I always thought Darryl and Pam might get me fired for something I said.  				,6,24,104
Michael, So see you in Meredith’s van in five minutes.,6,24,104
Michael," No, you know what’s messed up? This situation all up in here is what’s messed up! We need to brainstorm, we need to get out of this! Brain hurricane. Come on, think. ",6,24,104
Michael," It’s okay, she’s cool, she also whistle-blew.",6,24,104
Michael," Hey, hey, it’s as interesting as a morgue.  				",6,24,104
Michael," Okay, here’s what we do. I say we just smash all the computers. We destroy the evidence. No evidence, no case.",6,24,104
Michael," No. Okay, not all the computers, just our computers.",6,24,104
Michael," That’s just what we need, another black man in prison. You know, let’s just…",6,24,104
Michael," I was thinking about our little leak problem. I was up all lunch thinking about what we should do to this individual. You know what I think we should do? We make ’em come to work, and we work ’em, and we make ’em sit next to all the people they screwed over. And, and we pay ’em but we make ’em feel like they did something really wrong. The one question I have is, do we give them a Christmas bonus? I say yes, it’s Christmas, but right after they’re back in the thick of it.",6,24,104
Michael," [on Jo’s jet] Are we going some place far away? I know you said no questions, but… I have an early dinner that I need to get to… with the Chief of Police.  				",6,24,104
Michael," Well, I’m going through a little bit of a rough patch.",6,24,104
Michael," Whole year, actually. My favorite restaurant closed down.",6,24,104
Michael," And my new favorite restaurant sucks… I bought a video camera last year, and I was looking at the tapes, and there were only like twelve minutes that I felt was worth taping the whole year. And most of that was just birds in my condo complex. What is that? … I miss Holly.",6,24,104
Michael, Holly Flax from the Nashua branch. Best HR rep that Dunder Mifflin has ever seen. It’s not been a blockbuster year for me financially. My Blockbuster stock is down.  				,6,24,104
Michael," You know, I would be willing, under the right circumstances, to do that for you.",6,24,104
Michael," I, I surely do, and don’t call me honey. [Jo laughs] You were playing too.  				",6,24,104
Michael," [to press] We at Sabre have betrayed the trust that we have built with our customers. We regret our slow response and our lapse in candor and judgment. At this time, we are issuing a full recall of all Sabre GH400 printers. We will not rest until this problem is solved. There will be no questions. Are there any questions?  				",6,24,104
Michael," Okay. Hey, you could transfer Holly back from Nashua. ",6,24,104
Michael, [performs magic-tricks while lip-syncing],7,1,106
Michael," I suppose summer had to end sometime. It’s sad, though, because I had a great summer. I got West Nile virus, lost a ton of weight. Then I went back to the lake. I stepped on a piece of glass in the parking lot, which hurt. That got infected even though I peed on it. Saw ‘Inception.’ Or at least I dreamt I did.  				",7,1,106
Michael," He’s not the worst, okay? He’s not the worst. You know who’s the worst? That intern we had a few years ago. That guy-remember? Eeeh! That face, how ugly he was? He was the worst. Good worker, though. [starts drinking coffee] Ah! It’s not cappuccino.",7,1,106
Michael," It’s just coffee, guys! But, yeah, I’ll look into it, okay?  				",7,1,106
Michael," Okay, rude. Luke, I want you to go to the supermarket for me.",7,1,106
Michael, To get some ice cream for everybody. It’s national ice cream afternoon. Great.  				,7,1,106
Michael," And another thing I did this summer, I hired my nephew.   				",7,1,106
Michael," Having Luke here is a pretty big deal for me, because his mother, who also happens to be my half-sister, kind of cut me off from that side of the family 15 years  a-  14. The last time I saw Luke was the opening day of ‘Ace Ventura II’ and that was ’95, so yes, 15 years on the dot. Anyway, I lost him in a forest.  				",7,1,106
Michael," That means don’t. Haven’t you seen Ghostbusters, Pam?",7,1,106
Michael," No, it… Yes, okay, right. [erases don’t] All right, yep. My bad. I got it. Here we go. [writes “Don’t”  in front of symbol]",7,1,106
Michael," Come on. Okay, um… [draws a circle around “Don’t” with a line through it] That’s as clear as I can make it.",7,1,106
Michael, Because I don’t want it getting back to Sabre that we’re yelling at assistants. I think it would reflect poorly on us. ,7,1,106
Michael," Nope, it won’t be Gabe but actually, there is somebody in the office that is very, very close to Luke.",7,1,106
Michael," Well, Dwight, he wiped his butt. Is that close enough for you?",7,1,106
Michael," No. No, Toby. He’s not. Yes he is. He’s my nephew.",7,1,106
Michael," Yes, exactly. That is a very nice way of putting it, Oscar. Mixing family and business is a beautiful thing.",7,1,106
Michael, Do you think they should have had open auditions for the band Hanson? What if no one named Hanson showed up? That wouldn’t even make sense. Or what if they just hired the littlest kid and a 50-year-old guy who was a murderer? Really safe.,7,1,106
Michael," God, when he needed help on Earth, who did he hire? Jesus Christ, his son.",7,1,106
Michael," No! No. I’m just saying, why does God get to do something that I don’t?",7,1,106
Michael," Well, then, why aren’t you bugging me to fire everybody who’s bad? You just want me to fire Luke. That’s reverse nepotism.  He should not be punished because he is related to me and bad at what he does!",7,1,106
Michael," Because I wanted you to come to me and say, “Wow, he is so great.” And I was gonna say, “Well, it’s in the genes.” And I was actually gonna be wearing jeans. And I’d point to them, right? No. But you ruined it. So, thank you very much. Here he comes. Guys, look. I don’t want you to treat him like anyone else in the office. I just want you to treat him like my nephew. Hey, there he is. ",7,1,106
Michael," Ok, you know what? Just -just back off! Back off! ",7,1,106
Michael," All right, those might be his. He might own an Ebay store.",7,1,106
Michael," Ok, ok. You know what? This is disgusting. This is like a witch hunt. This is like the Blair Witch Hunt project. ",7,1,106
Michael, I’m reconsidering sending them back anyway. ,7,1,106
Michael," Don’t-all right. Well, ok, you’ve just committed a felony.",7,1,106
Michael," No, I know they fit. It’s not about the fit.   				",7,1,106
Michael, Because Gabe tattled. I was perfectly happy to just hide it from you.,7,1,106
Michael," Well, this office is my pool. And my house is my house. And I just want my nephew to work in my pool.",7,1,106
Michael, I will cover his ass like moss on a Mississippi tree stump.,7,1,106
Michael," Luke and I have been working side-by-side as master and commander. Me as master, he as commander. Occasionally he will need a little push, and I will do that, and he’ll slow down, and I’ll push him again. That’s the thing with kids, you have to keep pushing. You have to push them until they push you back. And then you push some more. It’s all about give and take, but mostly it’s about pushing each other.   				",7,1,106
Michael," Luke is going to use his laser pointer to point to account setup. You click on that first, then a whole new-Not, no, no, no! [Luke points laser at Oscar’s forehead] Luke, come on. Come on. Not on Oscar’s head. Alright. Luke, come on. Stop it!",7,1,106
Michael," No, just power it down. No, no, no, no, no. Not on Angela’s boob. Come on. Come on. Luke, seriously. ",7,1,106
Michael," All right. Okay. Good job. Okay, email accounts. So we’re starting with account setup-",7,1,106
Michael," Ok, I am going to count down from five. ",7,1,106
Michael," [bending Luke over desk, spanking him repeatedly] You are going to learn to be more professional, Luke!",7,1,106
Michael, All right. Are we good? [Luke runs out crying] You’re okay. He’s okay. There are many different schools of thought on capital punishment. ,7,1,106
Michael," Yes, of course. What is this in reference to?  				",7,1,106
Michael," Would have been nice to work with my family. It would have been nice if Luke had been able to stay here. But he couldn’t. These things seldom work out. I don’t know how Ringling Brothers do it. Night after night, town after town, all across America. You would think they’d be sick of each other by now. But, clearly, they make it work. And my hat’s off to them.   				",7,1,106
Michael, That’s it? Really? That’s nothing. All right. That’s highway robbery.,7,1,106
Michael,  This is the worst! You are the worst! I hate looking at your face! I wanna smash it!   				,7,2,107
Michael,"  Ok, you know what? I made a mistake. I committed corporate punishment. My bad. It’s over. It’s done. But my punishment is … um … worse than hell.   				",7,2,107
Michael,  I know what you want to ask me. “Did your mom ever see you naked?” ,7,2,107
Michael,"  So you can molest me? Oh, ok. I don’t think so. We’re going to leave the blinds open so every one can see what a big failure you are. That’s the key.  				",7,2,107
Michael,"  One hour. We’ve done one hour. Let’s just speed this up, ok? Keep it moving. I want to do all six hours today. ",7,2,107
Michael,"  No, no, no! I know my rights! All I had to do was sit here for six hours. Do my time. ",7,2,107
Michael,"  You know, do you have any idea how angry this is making me?",7,2,107
Michael,"  Yes, I will. I will talk alright. Be careful what you wish for Toby.   				",7,2,107
Michael,"  Well, the other night, I was sitting at the table, eating my penis… I mean peas. That was weird. Aaaah… weird. I think that was … I was probed. By an alien life form. An A.L.F. Alf, you know, I might have actually been probed by Alf. You might think he’s a puppet. You never see the lower half. But there is a lower half.   				",7,2,107
Michael,"  And I was raised by wolves. I was 25 years old before I saw my first human being. Wait, is it a full moon tonight? [howls and growls like a werewolf]",7,2,107
Michael,"  Yes, Yes. They are all fake stories. What sort of twisted mind would come up with weird stories like that? [pause] Three hours. We’re half way done. ",7,2,107
Michael,  I’ve played it once or twice with Jeff.,7,2,107
Michael,"  Jeff was my mother’s boyfriend, who she married.",7,2,107
Michael,"  Yeah, Yeah. I guess I never thought about it that way, though. ",7,2,107
Michael,"  Yeah. You know what? He took me to a baseball game once, I remember. It was weird though. They took the pitcher out of the game. I felt really bad, because the pitcher wasn’t able to play with his friends anymore. But Jeff said that the manager was making a really good move, by taking the pitcher out. He really respected the manager.   				",7,2,107
Michael,"  I was afraid I would find him in the park, playing with another kid.",7,2,107
Michael,  I guess that’s why I thought he ran away in the first place. To find a kid he liked better.,7,2,107
Michael,  Right. Why would a dog do that? That’s silly. ,7,2,107
Michael,"  When I hear myself say it, it sounds ridiculous. But I’ve never said it out loud, so…",7,2,107
Michael,"  Well, lets not get too… This isn’t a counseling session… Ok. Son of a gun. Son of a bitch. Wow! Ok.",7,2,107
Michael,  You. Bitch. God! You’re very helpful aren’t you? You try to help everybody. Do you want to play another game?,7,2,107
Michael,  You are good. But you know what? You can’t help people. You couldn’t help your marriage. You lose. I don’t need your help. Nobody needs your help. Nobody wants it! You can’t help anybody. I don’t need your help! Am I going to make you cry?,7,2,107
Michael,  You’ll do. . . ok. Filled out. Good. Thank you doctor. Take two of these [giving Toby two middle fingers] and call me in the morning.   				,7,2,107
Michael,  You forged them! You forged the forms!,7,2,107
Michael,"  Yes, but you had me so worked up that I made a mistake. ",7,2,107
Michael,"  You don’t make a mistake on purpose, Toby! Then it is no longer a mistake… Gabe. He messed it up. He messed up the forms, I bet… [mimicking Gabe] “I mess everything up so I can fix it and keep my job! Bah! Good thing I’m here cause I do nothing. I make everybody nervous!” [normal voice] Ah, ok. Got your notebook? Alright. Alright, lets bang this out. Let’s do it to it!  				",7,2,107
Michael, [cheers loudly after cast finishes singing song] That was amazing! That was awesome! I auditioned for this. When did the cast list go up?,7,3,108
Michael, Really? They didn’t call me. Who am I playing? …Andy?  				,7,3,108
Michael," They say that no one can take your pride, but the people who cast Andy’s play, they took mine.  				",7,3,108
Michael," I can’t Andy, it’s too hard. That’s-I put everything I had into that audition. Do you understand that?",7,3,108
Michael," I wish I could, Andy, but I can’t. I have plans that night. I’m going to see a friend in a play called Sweeney Todd. You’re that friend. I’m going to see your play. ",7,3,108
Michael,"  I did, because I am being the bigger man, and balloons are bigger than flowers. ",7,3,108
Michael, [trying to stuff balloons below the seats] This is ridiculous. You’d think they’d discourage people from bringing in balloons.,7,3,108
Michael," No, Darryl. This guy’s a world-class actor. He doesn’t daylight as your plumber. ",7,3,108
Michael," Thank you. You, too. [steals a bottle of wine from the bar]  				",7,3,108
Michael, [during curtain call for Sweeney Todd] Boo! Boo!  				,7,3,108
Michael," Mmm! Fruit is so much better when it’s dried. I’ve already eaten, like, 30 apricots. ",7,3,108
Michael," Hmm? No, there were a lot of people booing you. I wasn’t one of em.",7,3,108
Michael," Well, he was getting a lot of applause, and I just didn’t think it was indicative of how people were really feeling. ",7,3,108
Michael," Hey, what’s going on here? Post-show blues? ",7,3,108
Michael," Yeah, I get those every day after work.",7,3,108
Michael,"  Oscar. Enough with the sass, please. God! What is wrong with you? Andy, listen to me. Look me in the eye. I thought that you were awesome. ",7,3,108
Michael," I am not just saying that. You can trust that I am telling you the truth. I booed someone tonight. I have no filter. And if I thought you were terrible, I would have booed. And if I thought you had done a better job, I would be saying nicer things right now. But I thought that you were exactly awesome. No better, no worse.",7,3,108
Michael, I did not say that to make you feel good. I just said it. Total integrity.,7,3,108
Michael," In the criminal justice system, the people are defended by two separate but equally important groups, the police who investigate the crimes and the district attorneys who prosecute the offenders. These are their stories. Kun-kun! [imitates vacuum cleaner] I’m just a cleaning lady. Aah! A dead body. He wrapped his belt around his own neck. It looks like a classic case of autoerotic asphyxiation. Yeah, looks like everyone’s tightening their belts in this economy. [humming theme music] Last time you saw the victim, was he happy? Last time I saw this John, he was-he wasn’t a victim, if you know what I’m talkin about.",7,3,108
Michael," No, that was- I’m just getting into the first act.   				",7,3,108
Michael, There are many reasons a man would wear a fake mustache to work. [spinning in chair] He is a fan of the outrageous. He loves to surprise! He loves… other things as well.  				,7,4,109
Michael," [shying away] Look, [sighs] It’s a pimple Phyllis. Avrile Lavigne gets them all the time and she rocks harder than anyone alive.",7,4,109
Michael," Just a cold sore, thank you. Phyllis, I don’t have acne. I have a cold sore. I don’t even have a cold. I don’t know how I got it.",7,4,109
Michael, Yeah! My last physical when I was forty.,7,4,109
Michael," Why at least? If you’re guessing forty six just say forty six. [later in his office, places a band-aid over his cold sore]  				",7,4,109
Michael," How did this happen, how did I get this?",7,4,109
Michael," You know what, I feel like one of those old timey sailors. With the eye patch. [in pirate voice] It’s me own damn fault. Woman in every port.",7,4,109
Michael, Don’t even! Holly was clean! Okay? If anything I gave it to her.,7,4,109
Michael, Okay! You know what? Might! Might be crawling with herpes. I might have gotten it after her.,7,4,109
Michael, [makes grunt in attempt to stop Dwight. Dwight hangs up]  				,7,4,109
Michael," I have a disease, for which there is no known cure, that has been sexually transmitted to me.",7,4,109
Michael," No, I am calling to see if you gave me herpes. Because if you did I would be able to avoid a lot of sucky conversations. So you have it right?",7,4,109
Michael, Yes I am telling you you have to get tested for herpes. Good-bye!,7,4,109
Michael, Busted. So what can I do for you Holly.,7,4,109
Michael, [Dwight looks confused to the camera] Were they in the missionary position? [Holly laughs]  				,7,4,109
Michael, [still on phone with Holly] Do you ever wonder what life would have been like if you hadn’t been transferred?,7,4,109
Michael," We would have twins. [Dwight points towards the corner of his lip, indicating Michael’s “herpes”]",7,4,109
Michael, I don’t romanticize th- [Dwight nodding and mouthing ‘Yes you do’] No…,7,4,109
Michael," He had no arms or legs, he couldn’t hear see, or speak… This is how he let a nation.",7,4,109
Michael," [after long wait, to Dwight] Would you excuse us…",7,4,109
Michael, Am I the kind of person to misremember our relationship as more than it ever was?,7,4,109
Michael," Well, there was a little bit of a learning curve in the conversation department, but between the sheets we were like Jordan and Pippin!",7,4,109
Michael," [sighs] Ok, so I’m the guy at the station.",7,4,109
Michael, I used to think that she was the one. Or at least A the one. And if I called that one so wrong…  				,7,4,109
Michael," You know, I don’t know if I trust Jan’s judgment. She…",7,4,109
Michael," No, I’m not talking about paper. Relationships, they have the ability to point out if the man is making a bigger deal out of something that is really there.",7,4,109
Michael, [walks into park with Dwight] Hi stranger! Long time!,7,4,109
Michael," Oh hey! Dwight, would you take my grandmother for a walk while I talk to Helene?",7,4,109
Michael, Did I make more of what we had then what was really there?,7,4,109
Michael," Just a quirky indie movie weird sort of thing, breaking all the rules. But had to end, because the summer was over. For you…",7,4,109
Michael," I’m great! I saw your-your sign outside. And I decided, I’m going to pull in, and maybe buy a house from her.",7,4,109
Michael," You put the TV here, you put the family over here.",7,4,109
Michael, Someone told me that I romanticize relationships,7,4,109
Michael," I just found out today. It’s, uh, right there.",7,4,109
Michael," I knew what I was thinking at the time, but right now it just seems ridiculous.",7,4,109
Michael," Hi Holly it’s Michael, I just wanted to call and let you know that I was thinking about what you said. It’s just. You know?  It’s weird. Today I ended up seeing a lot of women that I used to date, and in my mind they were all great. And then when I actually saw them, it was mostly a freak show. And you and me, that must have been a real train wreck. You know what, Holly? You’re wrong. You are wrong. I remember every second of us. And talking to them today, I don’t feel for them anything like what I feel for you. I didn’t joke with any of them, I joked with you. You are the only one who was actually happy to hear from me. And I don’t know why you downgraded what we had but I did not make us up. Ok.  Oh, wait, and you should talk to a doctor because you might have herpes. Bye.  				",7,4,109
Michael," Oscar, we once sucked face in public. As part of an office presentation to destroy the stigma of gay kissing. Do you recall?",7,4,109
Michael, You may have given me a sexually transmitted disease.,7,4,109
Michael, I have already contacted all of my ex-lovers except for you.,7,4,109
Michael," Moolit Gandala, carrage drive through Central Park…",7,4,109
Michael, An electric car dealership. [Oscar gets up and starts leaving],7,4,109
Michael, Oscar! Think abou- Think! [door slams]   				,7,4,109
Michael," Oh, look at that. [pushing bike]  Smooth roll.",7,5,110
Michael," Yes, I can ride a bike. I take spinning classes three times a month. I think I know how to ride a bike.  				",7,5,110
Michael," I did, yes! I had those extra wheels on the back…that support you. [Pam and Jim begin wheeling him] Mi-chael! Mi-chael!",7,5,110
Michael," [crashes into Jim and Pam’s parked car] Oh, my god!",7,5,110
Michael," Ow! [grunts, stumbles to his feet] You never forget. Whoo!  				",7,5,110
Michael," Brainstorming session is now open. Anyone has an idea-[cell phone rings] Hold on. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Hello?",7,5,110
Michael," I will see you in ten. Bye! Hold tight. [hangs up] Well, I know a lot of you thought that my sales days were behind me, and to be honest, so did I…and the only reason I got out of the sales game was to be reluctantly called back in.",7,5,110
Michael," [laughing] No, I don’t have time for this. Are you kidding me?",7,5,110
Michael, No! Okay. [runs out the door] All right.  				,7,5,110
Michael," That…hello. Michael Scott, Dunder-Mifflin Paper Company.",7,5,110
Michael," Yeah, well…we call it overkill. Why am I telling you my strategy?",7,5,110
Michael, Buh-bye. I could swear that guy was a male model.,7,5,110
Michael," Oh, thank you. All right. On the count of three, it’s showtime. Ready, one, two–",7,5,110
Michael," Okay, you know-all right, just forget it then.",7,5,110
Michael, It’s showtime! Oh…never mind. Let’s go.  				,7,5,110
Michael," When I knock on your door, you know who it is; it’s Michael Scott. We’ve been together forever and we-",7,5,110
Michael," You know what? You are having some problems with your loading dock, are you not? All right. We’re going to deliver to you on weekends.",7,5,110
Michael," And you know what else we’re gonna do? I can’t believe I’m gonna say this…we are going to offer you our paper at cost. I know. I could get in a lotta trouble for this, so you’d better shake my hand right now.",7,5,110
Michael," Stop it. Just stop it. We did what we should have done, we just got bested. [pounds the elevator button] Why is there a door close button if it doesn’t even close the door?  				",7,5,110
Michael," How do I feel about losing the sale? It’s like if Michael Phelps came out of retirement, jumped in the pool, belly-flopped, and drowned.  				",7,5,110
Michael," You know who we always lose out to? Staples, the big guys. Osprey? They’re a small company. They’re smaller than we are. What’s our excuse? How do we combat this guy? Stanley, how do we combat him?",7,5,110
Michael," Okay. You know what? You clearly don’t care, so why don’t you just leave?",7,5,110
Michael," Why don’t you go outside and…take a shot of insulin and have a nap, okay?",7,5,110
Michael," I don’t know, your frame, your build-why don’t you have a glass of apple juice and tell me you’re not a diabetic. [Stanley stands to leave] See? I could tell by the sound you made when you stood up that you have-okay. Yes, Phyllis?",7,5,110
Michael, You know what this is? This is a stinger.,7,5,110
Michael," Paul Newman, Robert Redford. They’re bank robbers.",7,5,110
Michael," Pull it together, all right? Stop lookin’ at him.",7,5,110
Michael, Oh…my god! He’s making her sell to him.  				,7,5,110
Michael," Stop, stop! Oh, my god! [enters office] Okay. Stop it, stop it, stop it. Gross! Stop it, please. Everybody, stop.",7,5,110
Michael," I said stop. Okay, Danny…this is not Pennsylvania Solartech. This is Dunder-Mifflin Paper Company. This is Meredith Palmer-",7,5,110
Michael," Don’t! Get away from him. Please, just leave. Get out of here. Go. Forever.",7,5,110
Michael," I owe you…a most sincere and humble apology. We were trying to watch you to see your sales technique, so we could stop losing so many clients to you.",7,5,110
Michael, Yes. And it’s the sincerest form of flattery.,7,5,110
Michael," Okay. You know what, it wasn’t just me. Jim and Dwight are behind that wall in the surveillance room and it was their plan as well.",7,5,110
Michael," No, we don’t. Here’s-here’s my point. Danny, listen, you have to understand that we are not normally like this. We just-we wanted to know your tricks.",7,5,110
Michael," You are, you are. You are! Stop it, stop it. Stop. [closes door] You are a good salesman. And because of that…I want you to work for me.",7,5,110
Michael," Hold it, hold it. [forcing door closed] Hold on, hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait. Wait. Danny, I want you to look at me. Do you want your life to be better…or to be worse or to stay the same?",7,5,110
Michael," Answer the question. Do you want a better life, Danny?",7,5,110
Michael," Do you want more freedom, less freedom, or to stay the same?",7,5,110
Michael," I can give you more money-there’s your better life. I can let you come and go as you please-there’s your freedom. And you already know Dunder-Mifflin has the best service and the best prices, but you beat us anyway. Can you imagine how well you would do selling our stuff?  				",7,5,110
Michael," Everyone, may I have your attention? I would like to introduce you to Mr. Danny Cordray. He is going to be joining us as our new traveling salesman. Say hello to Danny!",7,5,110
Michael," O-kay. You know what? No. No. This is not some sort of construction site…or all of Italy, where you can just go around treating people like meat. We are to respect him. I respect him because he reminds me of somebody. Can anybody guess who that is?",7,5,110
Michael," No, me. Right? Sorta like…a little younger version of me.",7,5,110
Michael," Okay. Let’s-all right, all right. Let’s talk. Please don’t let him leave. [pointing to Danny] Don’t leave. Don’t let him.",7,5,110
Michael," Guys, let me ask you something. Do you want your life to be better or worse or stay the same?",7,5,110
Michael," Okay. Well…get ready, ’cause it’s gonna get better.",7,5,110
Michael," No, no. Wrong. He would have stolen your clients, but you know what? He can’t now. This guy used to steal sales from us; now, he’s going to steal sales for us.",7,5,110
Michael," He doesn’t need to sit, he’s a traveling salesman. Look, I am not going to exclude good people from our staff simply because they are threatening to you. And unless you have a better argument than that, I suggest you leave.",7,5,110
Michael," This morning, Danny Cordray stole a sale from me. So what do I do? I go out and I steal Danny Cordray. The sale that mattered, I made. Boom. Funny thing about it, we don’t even need him. We already have Packer on the road. Chhguuh! Crap. I forgot about Packer.  				",7,5,110
Michael," [standing outside the conference room, wearing fake teeth, watching Stanley walk in] All right, everybody, take a seat. As you may have heard, our branch on the planet Jupiter is up eight thousand percent in sales! ",7,6,111
Michael," A lot of people are really getting into Halloween this year! [puts head down over fake bomb made from cardboard, high pitched voice] Six seconds, MacGruber! [lifts head] Pam’s got a lot of fun stuff planned! [puts head down, high pitched voice] Uh, two seconds MacGruber! [lifts head] Including a… costume contest, and bobbing for apples, and a Ouija board… OHHH! BOOM! OHH EXPLOSION! [throws fake bomb, takes off sunglasses, points to camera] MACGRUBERRRR!  				",7,6,111
Michael, [laughs] OH! Who likes to water ski on Lake Erie? No wai-where does Dracula like to water ski?,7,6,111
Michael," So, wait, drivers are going to be able to sell paper on the road?",7,6,111
Michael," Oh, so… I almost forgot. You’ll find this hilarious. Apparently corporate is going to have drivers sell paper on their routes now. That’s like, exactly sort of the idea that you had.",7,6,111
Michael," Yeah. I’m sorry. I blew this. You should have gotten credit for that, man.",7,6,111
Michael, Okay. [reaches out and shakes Darryl’s hand] Okay.,7,6,111
Michael, Oh. It’s a ream of paper. Thought you might hit me.  				,7,6,111
Michael, Darryl Philbin is the greatest guy in the world. And you know what I’d like? I would like to have all the racists brought together and take Darryl Philbin out to lunch. Just to see what they’re missing.   				,7,6,111
Michael, Erin! Would you please do me a solid and get Darryl Philbin on the speakerphone?,7,6,111
Michael," You need to stop being so shy, come out here, and embrace who you really are, superstar!",7,6,111
Michael," Yeah, I bet it is! If you’re gonna do your job well here, you gotta get used to being embarrassed.",7,6,111
Michael, This whole delivery slash sales idea? You know whose idea that was? That was Darryl Philbin’s. He thought of that way before the corporate fat suits.,7,6,111
Michael," I got in the way. I said no. And it just stopped. But then corporate comes up with this idea, but you know what? They need to know that it was yours. And I don’t care if I take a bullet. We’re gonna call them, we’re gonna put them on speakerphone right now…",7,6,111
Michael, And we are going to straighten this out.,7,6,111
Michael, I’m a little peeved at Darryl right now.,7,6,111
Michael," No, he didn’t go behind my back. He went over my head.",7,6,111
Michael, [staring at Gabe and Kevin] What the hell are they talking about?,7,6,111
Michael," Do you think that Kevin is going over my head? I don’t-[sees Kevin and Gabe fist-bump] Oh my GOD. Okay. All right. All right. You know what? That’s inappropriate, Kevin. I am your boss, and if you have something to say, it goes through me, and then I take it to Gabe. Chain of command. Do you understand?",7,6,111
Michael," Okay, this whole going over my head-gate? Is making people act weird. The chain of command is crumbling. Do you know what just happened? I just made Kevin cry. And Gabe looks like Lady Gaga. That’s not Halloween. Halloween should be a day in which we honor monsters and not be mad at each other.",7,6,111
Michael, You went over my head. And then you lied to my face. So my head and my face have taken a beating.,7,6,111
Michael," Okay, that might help. If you said “I’m sorry” in front of everybody.",7,6,111
Michael," Yeah, I gotta get in on this. [mocking Darryl] Hey, it’s cool, man, I work in the warehouse! I’m cool! I’m hip and I’m jive! And I don’t care about nobody! Do you know who I am? Happy Halloween, jerk!  				",7,6,111
Michael, Still don’t know who I am? I’ll give you a hint. I go over other people’s heads.,7,6,111
Michael," NEVER! [tosses wig] Okay, you know what? Fine.  I’m not Darryl. And thank God I’m not Darryl.",7,6,111
Michael," Hey, can I play? Why don’t you ask if Darryl is a bad friend who backstabs people in the back?",7,6,111
Michael, If you had one word you would use to describe Darryl what would that word be?,7,6,111
Michael," If they’re good ideas, I’m not gonna say no!",7,6,111
Michael," That was-okay, you make one mistake in fifteen years and you drag me over the coals, after everything I did for you?",7,6,111
Michael," Stop it! Stop, stop. We’re thinking. We’re thinking about it.",7,6,111
Michael," You don’t have to point to the fact that we’re thinking about it. Stop it! Just let us think. Okay, next time you have a really great idea, we will put it in a hat, and then we will have Erin pick it out of the hat and let her decide.",7,6,111
Michael, Okay. We both reserve the right to go to Jo if we disagree with Gabe.,7,6,111
Michael," Unless you and I decide we want to talk to Jo, then we’ll give her a call.",7,6,111
Michael," That’s true, that’s true. I dated her momma, and you know what-",7,7,112
Michael," [under his breath] Um… kay. Uh, alright.",7,7,112
Michael," Oh, yes. [mimicking smoking] Doobie-doobie doo.  				",7,7,112
Michael," I invited everyone in the office because it’s not a day for just Jim or Pam or the baby or me. It is about us all. And I thought we should all celebrate… my joy. And our, all of ours joys.  				",7,7,112
Michael, [in an old man mobster voice] Hey. Hey. I got an offer that you can’t refuse. Scooch over.,7,7,112
Michael, Scooch. Before I shoot you in the head.,7,7,112
Michael, [clears his throat] So who is the godfather?,7,7,112
Michael," Okay. Old friend, like, you’ve known him since kindergarten?",7,7,112
Michael," No, I have plenty of friends, so… all right, well, you have great seats. Enjoy the show.",7,7,112
Michael," I don’t even know how to say this, but Cece is turning out to be a little b-i-t-c-h. And that’s not true, but her parents are kind of boxing me out.  				",7,7,112
Michael," Jim and Pam and Cece really seem to be clicking. They are totally gelling. It’s as if they leave my office and they go to another office that sells happiness. And good for them. That’s great, because, you know, the paper industry’s not gonna last forever.  				",7,7,112
Michael, [walking around and greeting people] How are you? Good morning. Good morning. ,7,7,112
Michael, I am feeling this. Call it the Holy Spirit or the passion of the Christ. I am loving these people.  				,7,7,112
Michael," You know what, guys, let’s just enjoy lunch.",7,7,112
Michael," [overhearing Dwight’s conversation] Hey, Dwight. Dwight, hey.",7,7,112
Michael, [pointing to group of young adults laughing] Look at that. Look at that. That’s fun. We need to do stuff together outside of work. Let’s go help Africa. Let’s go build an airport. We’ll start small. We’ll have a car wash. We’ll send some cheerleaders to regionals.,7,7,112
Michael," Yeah, well, that’s just a pick-up scene. Okay, we don’t have to volunteer. But I think we should hang out more together.",7,7,112
Michael, Look at these people. These are church-going people. And they know how to party.,7,7,112
Michael," No. Okay, you know what? This is inappropriate. What is wrong with you guys? What is wrong with you? What is so horrible about wanting to get together and do something nice? Why did you guys even come today? What’s so great about your lives that you think you’re better than everybody else? That you can make fun of everybody else? You’re mean. You’re mean girls. Like the movie, Mean Girls. And Kevin and Stanley, if you don’t stop worrying so much about what you’re gonna put in your gullet, you’re gonna die in about a month.  				",7,7,112
Michael, [standing in a line saying goodbye to the kids going to Mexico] Bye. Good luck. Good luck to you. Bye. Do good. Do good. Bye. Have fun. We’re proud of you. [starts to walk down through the line and into the bus] Bye. Okay.  				,7,7,112
Michael, [on the bus] Hey. Hey. Is this the bus to Mexico?,7,7,112
Michael, [in reference to the team shirts] I’ll take a shirt.,7,7,112
Michael," Really? [cheers, applause] Thank you. All right.  				",7,7,112
Michael," No, I’m not. I’m staying on the bus. I’m already on the bus. I’m going.",7,7,112
Michael, It is not irresponsible! I have never been more confident about a decision in my life.,7,7,112
Michael," You know what, my job will be here when I get back.",7,7,112
Michael," Tell them that I died, and I turned into an angel, and when they feel a breeze in a room with all the windows closed or that-that chill on the back of their neck, that is just me watching over them.",7,7,112
Michael, [waving goodbye as the bus drives away] See you in a few months.  				,7,7,112
Michael," Well, you know what, everybody thinks that I am crazy, and that tells me that I am the sanest person I know. So… ",7,7,112
Michael," Ooh. What are we building down there again? Like, a hospital? A school for Mexicans? What?",7,7,112
Michael, Why aren’t they building it themselves?,7,7,112
Michael, Do we know how? I don’t know how. You know how?,7,7,112
Michael," Carla knows. Oh, I feel like there were so many more people on this bus. There were, like, 200, 300 people before. Hey, Carla? Carla? Hi. What are you doing?",7,7,112
Michael," What is happening? Oh, God, what is happening?",7,7,112
Michael," Oh, God, you know what? I’m gonna be in Mexico for my half-birthday.",7,7,112
Michael," No, we-No. You know how these things go. Construction projects, they say three months, and then, after two years, the lazy bums haven’t even started. Now we’re those lazy bums. I gotta get off this bus.  				",7,7,112
Michael, Can you fake a seizure or a heart attack or something?,7,7,112
Michael," [having walked up to the front] Okay, driver, driver, if you’re not gonna stop this bus, then I’m going to stop it for you. Okay? Hang on. [pulls the string to request a stop, makes a dinging sound]",7,7,112
Michael," Yeah, just get him to stop the bus, please.",7,7,112
Michael," I didn’t sign up for this. You guys are young, that’s great. You want to give back to society. I’ve done that. I need to take.",7,7,112
Michael, We could go back and forth all day. It’s not gonna solve anything.,7,7,112
Michael," Do you want that for little Jessica? No, you don’t. And the answer is clear. Stop the bus. Okay?",7,7,112
Michael," [bus stopping] Okay, well, a pleasure. Go save the world. We’ll keep an eye on America for you.",7,7,112
Michael, It is so nice to be back in a country that has movies.,7,7,112
Michael, [whispering to Pam] They have him surrounded. It’s the SWAT. The SWAT’s arriving.,7,8,113
Michael," Ok, that’s our street! That’s our street! He’s going down our street! [runs out of conference room.] Come on everybody! [all quickly follow]  				",7,8,113
Michael, [on sidewalk] There it is! I saw it! I saw it! He went right by! You missed it! [all groan]  				,7,8,113
Michael," [collecting pebbles off the street into a jar] Grandpa, where were you the day the the Scranton Strangler was caught? [old man voice] Well kiddo, I was there. I was there… And I’ll tell you what. [shakes jar of pebbles] You go sell these and buy yourself a nice spaceship.  				",7,8,113
Michael," [obviously faking being serious the whole time] Glee? What is Glee, some television program? Jim I need that thing stat!",7,8,113
Michael, Dwight! Sign please. I don’t have time for parties I don’t have time for TV shows. Stanley! What time is that thing I have to do?,7,8,113
Michael, Cancel it! Are you still here? [to Erin] ,7,8,113
Michael, MMM MMM MM MM MM! Did you hear what I said? I’m a very busy man. I don’t have time for your TV show.,7,8,113
Michael," I’m joking. I’m kidding around! I’m not actually angry. [Erin laughs] I’m not busy at all, I’m not doing anything. And I know what Glee is, I’m a total Gleek.",7,8,113
Michael, You know who my favorite character is? The invalid. [Jim makes a face] I am coming to your party.  				,7,8,113
Michael, What? No Gabe is… Gabe is not the boss.,7,8,113
Michael, Yeeee… Guys! Do you consider Gabe to be the boss?  				,7,8,113
Michael," Gabe likes to entertain a lot, ad he cooks in an oven, and all that jazz. I just have a different life style. They have these bags of vegetables that steam right inside their own bag. So I’ll get a few ingredients, sit down in front of the TV, a bag of vegetables, before you know it I’m ready for bed!  				",7,8,113
Michael," Try and destroy the old ways, Gabe, well I will not let you. [throws pizza dough, hits the ceiling]  				",7,8,113
Michael," Where’s Michael? Where’s Michael? We can’t start without Michael! Oh here he is! Ohhhh. Yayyy, and let the show begin! [turning up volume]",7,8,113
Michael," Actually I think it’s not loud enough. May I? Thank you sah! [takes remote, raises volume] There we go. Glee right? Rock and roll! Turn it up to elevaan! Spinal Cord!",7,8,113
Michael, [grabs different remote from the table] Well I will turn up the volume.,7,8,113
Michael," Okay…  Heeeere’s what we’re gonna do! Right down the hall is a bed room. All the real Glee fans are gonna go down the hall to the real Glee party in the bedroom, follow me! Where we can crank it!  				",7,8,113
Michael," Pam I have a loaded gun in my desk at work. If I ever start acting like that weenie Gabe I want you to take that gun, and I want you to shoot me like a hundred times in the groin until I’m dead. Okay?",7,8,113
Michael," [Pam in the background struggling with Cece] Better men than Gabe have tried to be my boss. David got fired. Charles got fired. Jan went crazy. Ed Truck, who I liked, got decapitated.",7,8,113
Michael, Is this the same dough you used for the pizza crust?,7,8,113
Michael," So these are pizza dogs, they aren’t pigs in a blanket per se.",7,8,113
Michael, [grimacing] That’s what she said. [leaves]  				,7,8,113
Michael, [outside opening Gabe’s cable hookup box] Okay… Alright.  				,7,8,113
Michael, What does that mean? Party’s over? Everybody leaves? Are you sure?,7,8,113
Michael," Boy I wish I could see that. You know what? I have an idea. I don’t know if it’s gonna work, but let me give it this. Okay, I’m gonna give it shot. [hurries out]",7,8,113
Michael," No I was just check- Yeah. Yes I did, yeah yeah.",7,8,113
Michael," What is there to like? He’s just, he’s a weird little skeevy guy with no waist, why do you care whether we like him or not?",7,8,113
Michael, Why? I’m not your father. [Erin looks sad] All right.,7,8,113
Michael, You listen to me. You listen good. You are are ,7,8,113
Michael, As long as you are living under this roof you are going to do what I say.,7,8,113
Michael," [enters, looks to Gabe] If you break that girl’s heart, I will kill you. It’s just a figure of speech. But seriously, if you break that girl’s heart I will literally kill you and your entire family.    				",7,8,113
Michael," Gabe, just go and have fun with Erin. But not too much fun! That girl’s gonna turn my hair gray.  				",7,8,113
Michael," Okay, moving backwards, our I.T. Guys have been…  Glasses, Turban, Ear Hair, Fatty 3, Shorts, Fatty 2, Lozenge, and Fatso. I think Lozenge was the one who installed it.",7,9,114
Michael," You know what? It made me laugh when I heard it, but Pam got really offended.",7,9,114
Michael, The important thing is… this kept us secure people.  ,7,9,114
Michael," I sent you a Facebook message yesterday, I still haven’t heard anything back. ",7,9,114
Michael, I think an investor’s ski trip is the best idea. It will be a bonding experience. ,7,9,114
Michael," I was looking at a trail map, and I was thinking that we should start on a bunny hill, because I’ve never actually been skiing. And then work our way up to death drop. ",7,9,114
Michael," Excuse me, everyone… SEX! Now that I have your attention… ",7,9,114
Michael," Wuphf! All right, I’ve warmed them up for you. You have the floor, Ryan.",7,9,114
Michael," Wait, Ryan, so this could be over by the weekend?",7,9,114
Michael," No, not this weekend; next weekend. We were gonna go on the investors ski trip. I bought poles.  ",7,9,114
Michael, Look at that. Triple your investment by January. ,7,9,114
Michael, Look at that! He threw ’em on the ground!,7,9,114
Michael," No, it’s not weird, Andy, and you know what else? We have an offer from Washington University. So monetize that. ",7,9,114
Michael, I won’t sell. And you know what? Ryan and I have the majority of shares. Isn’t that right?,7,9,114
Michael, I–yes. We’re not selling. I will not sell.   ,7,9,114
Michael," We Don’t? Well, why have I been separating the trash into whites and colors?",7,9,114
Michael, [throws the sack of garbage onto the floor] Eight Years.,7,9,114
Michael, I’m just saying that I think I agree with your point.,7,9,114
Michael, I thought it might make me feel better. ,7,9,114
Michael, [singing] But it just may be a lunatic… [stops singing] No.  ,7,9,114
Michael," Always have your back. So, any ideas on how we can get over this nine-day hump here?",7,9,114
Michael, Maybe I could take a second mortgage on my condo.,7,9,114
Michael, So you would think that’s a good idea for me to do?,7,9,114
Michael," Yeah, well, we never even have dinner now, so… ",7,9,114
Michael, Oh right. What am I saying? Rain Check.,7,9,114
Michael," I. Do not agree to sell, which is to say nay.",7,9,114
Michael," I’m not blind! I know exactly who he is. He is selfish and lazy and image-obsessed, and he is a bad friend. [all seem to be in agreenment] And he’s also clever. And he shoots incredibly high. And he may just make it. But you know what? Even if he doesn’t, I would rather go broke betting on my people, than get rich all by myself, on some island like a castaway. And there is no middle ground. ",7,9,114
Michael," Only if he fails. And you know what? Ryan, I believe in you. Just like I believe in all of you. You have nine days to save everybody’s money.",7,9,114
Michael," The world sends people your way… Ryan came to me through a temp agency. Andy was transferred here. No idea where Creed came from. The point is you just have to play with the cards that you’re dealt. [camera pans to different people in the office] Jim, that guy is an ace. Dwight is my King up my sleeve. Phyllis is my old maid. Oscar is my queen. That’s easy. Gimme a hard one. That’s what Oscar said. Toby is the instruction card you throw away. Pam’s a solid seven. And yeah, you know what? Ryan is probably, like, a two. But sometimes twos can be wild. So watch out. And I am obviously the joker. So… [phone rings, computer chimes, etc.] That’s Uh… ",7,9,114
Michael," [examines items on the reception desk] Mmhmm, China. China.",7,10,115
Michael," Everything here was made in China, Pam.",7,10,115
Michael," They used to make stuff in America, Andy. But we’re falling behind, did you know that? China is a sleeping dragon that is just beginning to stir.",7,10,115
Michael," Yeah, right here. It is right there. [holds up magazine] Anybody read the news any more?",7,10,115
Michael," I found that in the waiting room at the dentist’s office. This kid had the magazine I wanted to read, that’s the only one I could reach and I read it and then I read it again.  				",7,10,115
Michael," My whole life I believed that America was number one, that was the saying. Not America is number two. England is number two. China should be like eight.  				",7,10,115
Michael, So much for keeping our secrets up high.,7,10,115
Michael, I know what we’re going to do. We’re going to put our best minds on it.  				,7,10,115
Michael," Everybody stop working. I want you all to imagine a world in which America is not the number one superpower, where forks are irrelevant, and where every man, woman and child is expected to learn how to play the cello. Now open your eyes.",7,10,115
Michael," How do we stop it? With a big idea. That’s what America is built on, big ideas. Blue jeans, the Grand Canyon. Whose got one, whose got a big idea?",7,10,115
Michael, Once a week antacid is the idea to beat. Anyone else? Nobody? Okay then we are… yes.,7,10,115
Michael, I don’t know what the [expletive] that was.,7,10,115
Michael," No he’s not right. We’re not. Where would we even drop it, Phyllis? Did you know that in China there are fifty six cities with over a million people? You know how many we have here? Nine.",7,10,115
Michael, So I happen to know more than the smartest guy in the office. So what? [laughs] I don’t care.  				,7,10,115
Michael," Okay, now where were we before I bested Oscar?   				",7,10,115
Michael," Absolutely, Pam this is exactly why I hired you as Office Administrator, handle it. Taking care of business.",7,10,115
Michael, Not if the printer isn’t hooked up. You are making some very dangerous assumptions Oscar.,7,10,115
Michael," Alright, well I just need to learn everything about China. To be safe I should learn everything about everything but I don’t have time. Okay, okay, I’ll just learn about China and science and geography and math and literary.",7,10,115
Michael," I’m pretty good on politics. “California is bankrupt, and California, California.” [Jim and Andy follow Michael into his office] What?  				",7,10,115
Michael, I could talk about boobs. I bet he knows nothing about boobs.,7,10,115
Michael," Wait, wait, wait. How long is this going to take?",7,10,115
Michael," Did you know, that China has a new missile, that can sink a US Naval Carrier nine hundred miles off the coast?",7,10,115
Michael," Did you also know that China has secretly been expanding its nuclear arsenal. But what do I know, I mean, that’s just according to the Pentagon. Our Pentagon.  				",7,10,115
Michael, China has been loaning us billions upon billions of dollars. We are going to be owing them for the rest of our lives. And they will control us.,7,10,115
Michael, How then do you explain that in the past year manufacturing in China has risen by 17% and in the US it has only risen by 8%?,7,10,115
Michael," This chat. Two men, one white, one latina. A boss and a money cruncher. I could fire you.",7,10,115
Michael," My point is… that as long as people like you and me don’t stop talking, nobody can stop the USA.",7,10,115
Michael," I am talking about freedom, about choice. America, I don’t think you need to worry. Because if you want to beat China you will. If you don’t, that’s fine. That my friend, is your victory. Y’know, a lot of people say if you dig long enough and hard enough you will get to China, and that may be the true, but what they don’t tell you is that if you dig long enough and hard enough in a conversation, you get to a friend. So here is to conversation.",7,10,115
Michael," People, wait, wait, wait. Come back, come back. One fun one. We’re gonna do a fun one.",7,11,116
Michael, That’s it! That’s a picture! Yes! Jump in the air. We’re gonna jump in the air. Here we go.,7,11,116
Michael," Okay, everybody jump in the air this time, please. Here we go.",7,11,116
Michael," Don’t answer that. People, listen up and listen good. We need to just get one picture where we’re all in the air at the same time. Yes?",7,11,116
Michael, I believe in us. We can do this. Here we go.,7,11,116
Michael," Oh, ho, ho, ho! Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas, little children! [dressed as Santa]",7,11,116
Michael, No? Good. Did anyone get drunk already?,7,11,116
Michael," Good for you. Angela, lay it on me. What’s the problem?",7,11,116
Michael," So Stanley, how big is the bug up your butt today?",7,11,116
Michael," Alright. Well, I will be in my office making toys for the good children. Andy?",7,11,116
Michael," Well, that’s a relief. Santa’s gonna take some much-needed free time. Alright. Good!  				",7,11,116
Michael," My kids are growin up. As a boss, I look at that and say great. It is exactly what a boss would hope would happen because that’s what I want. That’s what every boss wants is a, is a wonderful Christmas with no drama.  				",7,11,116
Michael," Uh, because you’ve been on the Lam? Because the ‘boring police’ have been after you, and they finally caught up with you?",7,11,116
Michael," Yes, the case of the horrible red-headed sad sack. And the verdict, it was Toby. And the sentence, death. Death to Toby!",7,11,116
Michael," You know what you, you, you leave these huge pauses in your sentences. What do you expect me to do?",7,11,116
Michael," That is a great question, Erin. How do you describe somebody who is at the same time an old friend, and was a lover, and was a complicated part of my past, and maybe, just maybe a part of my future?",7,11,116
Michael," Holly’s coming back, everybody, and we have to have a party.",7,11,116
Michael," You know what, we’ll postpone this party until then. This is too important. Cancel this one. Dwight get rid of the tree.",7,11,116
Michael, Cancel. We’re canceling it. [Michael starts to throw away all of the food],7,11,116
Michael," No, no, no, we’re gonna get fresh for Holly. Fresh and new.",7,11,116
Michael, It’s not. They’re not. Fresh and new. Please let go. Please let go.,7,11,116
Michael," Well then everybody’ll chip in, it’ll be fine.",7,11,116
Michael," You know what, I’ll pay for it. I’ll pay for the party. It doesn’t matter. This is way too important. People, Holly’s coming back, and this is the most important Christmas party of my life. So back to work.  				",7,11,116
Michael," Man, I worked hard. I worked so hard for this! I was after corporate constantly. I emailed Joe. I wrote letters. And, know who I end up owing this to is the Scranton strangler. Thank you. Thank you, Scranton strangler. I love you! You just took one more person’s breath away.  				",7,11,116
Michael," We have always had good Christmas parties here, as you know, but they’ve never been cool. [imitating Sean Connery] The name is Bond… Santa Bond. I’ll have an eggnog, shaken, not stirred. Classic Brosnan. Santa… wonderful tradition. Everybody loves Santa. Everybody can’t get enough of the jolly old man. But that is a myth, because you know what, he is not necessarily a big fat guy with a beard. He’s not necessarily an old guy. No one knows what the real Santa Claus… God! Ow! [camera pans down to Angela pinning Michael’s pants]",7,11,116
Michael," Well, this year’s gonna be different. We’re gonna have fun. It’s not gonna be tacky. It’s going to be, you know what, the food is going to be austere. It is not going to be tacky, deli platter food. It’s not gonna have a big, fat, gross Santa Claus. It’s gonna be cool, sleek Santa.",7,11,116
Michael, Could he help us with some parking tickets?,7,11,116
Michael," Okay… [sighs] Oh, no, no, no, no! Fake tree. No, no!",7,11,116
Michael," Pam, no, no. Holly’s coming from New Hampshire. Somebody from New Hampshire looks at that and thinks it’s a burning cross. No, no. I want you to go and get a real tree. Take some money. Thank you.",7,11,116
Michael," [scats awkwardly] There’s nothing classier than boring Jazz music. I am here to tell ya. And I made a bit of a judgment call. I hired one musician, because I thought, what’s better, to hire an entire quartet for half an hour, or one bassist for the entire day?  				",7,11,116
Michael," When Holly gets here, I want you to be very helpful to her.",7,11,116
Michael," She doesn’t need an internet presence, you just know.",7,11,116
Michael, What the hell are you doing here? You’re supposed to be in the courthouse.,7,11,116
Michael," And then he will come back here and replace Holly, so stop asking him questions.  				",7,11,116
Michael," There she is. Hey. Erin, would you help her, for God’s sake?",7,11,116
Michael," [imitating her accent] Well, I never thought I’d see your face around these parts, you old bastard.",7,11,116
Michael," [as Curly] Why, you’re some sorta wise guy, huh?",7,11,116
Michael," Oh no, not the huggy monster! I don’t wanna die! I don’t wanna die! I don’t wanna die! [both sigh] Wow. Well, everybody, you remember Holly.",7,11,116
Michael," Well, you came on the day of our Christmas party.",7,11,116
Michael," Isn’t it wonderful? We love it here. Don’t you love it? All right, let me show you to your desk. [in a stereotyped Mexican accent] I show you to your desk.",7,11,116
Michael, What kind of guns do you have? Six-shooter?,7,11,116
Michael, This is weird. I can’t believe you’re here. This feels like you never left. Doesn’t it?,7,11,116
Michael," Oh, and you have a Woody. Bah! [the both chuckle] Oh, I love toy… ",7,11,116
Michael," Well, that’s understandable. Still raw. Woody your favorite character?",7,11,116
Michael, You know who my favorite character in Toy Story is? Andy’s mom.,7,11,116
Michael," Because without Andy’s mom, there’s no plot. And without any plot, there is no movie.",7,11,116
Michael, Really? That’s creepy. How did AJ get in your house?,7,11,116
Michael," [fighting back tears] Yeah, Randy Newman’s the best.",7,11,116
Michael," Hey there, Jada. Nice to see you again. I’m Santa Claus. Welcome.",7,11,116
Michael," Yeah, well, I was told that Holly would be here, single and ready to date. And we all got misled.",7,11,116
Michael," Nora Ephron, in every romantic comedy ever made.  				",7,11,116
Michael," I guess there are just some people who you stay together with when you transfer, and some people you don’t. And that’s just the way it is. And I can be mature about that. [clip of Michael throwing Holly’s Woody in the trash and pouring coffee on it]  				",7,11,116
Michael," What if Meredith was taking her smoking break below that window? You know what would have happened? The shards of glass would have shaved her face right off. And, yes, it might have been funny. But it also would have been incredibly tragic.",7,11,116
Michael," All this arguing reminds me of a very funny story. You see this on my desk? [he holds up a toy taxi cab] Know who gave me this? My girlfriend Tara, who lives in New York City.",7,11,116
Michael," I’m a man in my mid-40s and I still get zits. I think that’s pretty interesting. But you know what? I am not on trial here. The Scranton strangler is. So, anyway, we have this great weekend, and she drives me to the airport, and we get to JFK, but I am flying out of LaGuardia. So we laugh and laugh and laugh, and then we spend the rest of the day walking around Slo-mo, drinking latte. And at the end of the day, she gives me this, and she says, “Michael, maybe next time, you should take a cab.”",7,11,116
Michael, Did you see her face? Well it seems to me that there is a person sitting out there in the annex that still has feelings for Michael G. Scott. And it ain’t Tara.  				,7,11,116
Michael," What happened? What happened? Toby, what did you do? I think Toby’s very jealous of all the attention you’ve been getting.",7,11,116
Michael," Oh, really? Turn it on me. Well, isn’t that nice? Thank you very much.",7,11,116
Michael," Mmhmm. Mmhmm. Well, the fact that you would think that points to the possibility that it is probably not me. And that I have been framed.",7,11,116
Michael," Ahhhhhh! [laughs] Surprise! It was part of the party. Pretty funny, huh?",7,11,116
Michael, [laughs] I don’t. But someday I think we will laugh about this… when we tell our kids…,7,11,116
Michael," All right. Shh. Okay, you know what? Holly, I didn’t mean to do it. It was an accident. An accident borne of jealous feelings.",7,11,116
Michael," Oh, really? You certainly seemed jealous when I told you about my fake girlfriend. That’s what Jim and Dwight thought.",7,11,116
Michael," When you got transferred, and I drove you up to Nashua, you said, “Michael, I love you, but I can’t do this.” But then, with this other guy, you don’t have any problem with a long-distance relationship, do you? And you know what, that is what is the matter with me.",7,11,116
Michael, And we did this whole stupid party for you.,7,11,116
Michael," Mmm. Erin, would you do me a favor and find my street clothes for me, please?",7,11,116
Michael," Good, good. Good to see you. Have fun. Enjoy the partay.  				",7,11,116
Michael," Oh, hey, hey, no, don’t run. You’re gonna slip.",7,11,116
Michael," Yup. I read this story about a woman who slipped on some black ice, and she hit her head and went into a coma forever. And then every day, her husband went and visited her in the hospital until she died.",7,11,116
Michael," [voice breaking] Yeah, well, at least he was married.",7,11,116
Michael," No, it’s not. It’s not. Oh, man, I can tell you confidently that it is not gonna be okay.",7,11,116
Michael," Yeah. I mean, I can wait till then. Come here. I don’t want you to fall.  				",7,11,116
Michael," I was in the mall, and I saw that, and I thought it had your name written all over it.",7,11,116
Michael," No, that’s not… no, I went to the mall and I picked that out especially for you.",7,11,116
Michael, [hands Kelly a receipt from his wallet] From the mall. That…,7,11,116
Michael, Thank you. A Hostess apple pie! This is my favorite breakfast. How did you know that? Thank you very much.,7,11,116
Michael," Oh, you know, I seem to remember that Santa promised that he would listen to all the gifts you wanted for Christmas. Didn’t he say that?",7,11,116
Michael," You, are you sure you don’t want a pony? You want a real horse?",7,11,116
Michael, All right. You have to pick up after them.  				,7,11,116
Michael," January three, 2011. A day which will live in-famously. Holly Partridge Flax, otherwise known as Holly, otherwise otherwise known as a living, breathing angel, is engaged to another man. This is freaking me out. I- okay, let’s switch to the happy video, okay? No, no, no, no, let’s push through. We’ll do this.  				",7,12,117
Michael," Today will either be the best or the worst day of my life. Holly gave AJ an ultimatum. He either proposes by New Year’s or they break up. Now, if she’s engaged, I’m gonna go crazy, and I’m gonna start attacking people. If she’s not engaged, in all honesty, I may just burn this whole place to the ground out of happiness. Either way, I am going to need some talking down. And nobody talks me down like myself in a video talking me down.  				",7,12,117
Michael," [filming video] Michael, I know what you’re thinking. Holly’s engaged to another man, and you want to kill yourself. It may seem like a good idea, but it’s not.",7,12,117
Michael," Okay, so killing yourself. [laughs] I was just thinking about snot.  				",7,12,117
Michael," I did! I did, indeed. Two front row center, to Paula Poundstone, Live in Poughkeepsie. Holly’s favorite. I hope she doesn’t call us up on stage. That would suck. “Hey, you think you can do my job better?” I don’t know. “What’s your name?” Michael.  				",7,12,117
Michael, So… high five me. We’re back. To a happy… [grabs Holly’s hand] look at those! Mittens. Are those a present?,7,12,117
Michael," They’re so fuzzy and warm! Let me feel those. Let me feel that. Put ‘er there. Give me a good firm… ooh! That’s a good firm handshake. You’re hired! Yes, let’s get right into the Anderson account, shall we? Yes, yes, right away.",7,12,117
Michael, Oh my God! [sprays champagne on Erin]   				,7,12,117
Michael," Hello! Oh, somebody’s got a new phone! ",7,12,117
Michael, [imitating E.T.] E.T. phone Holly. Holly like phone?,7,12,117
Michael," I still have my old phone. This thing… indestructible. [slams phone on desk, phone breaks]",7,12,117
Michael," Holly doesn’t seem to be engaged, but she’s talking to AJ like she is. I can’t figure it out. Do you think she’s already dating a different AJ?",7,12,117
Michael," When you broke it off with Roy, did you still tell him you loved him?",7,12,117
Michael," No. She’d just resent me. Or worse! She would think of me as her friend. [disgusted voice] Oh, hi friend! Blegh.",7,12,117
Michael, That’s true. She’s really nice. She’d talk to anybody. Why don’t you bring Erin to balance you out?,7,12,117
Michael," Next year? Come-I mean, what is the point? What is the point of that? I made a resolution to floss, and I did it. 12:01, January first, BAM! Blood everywhere.",7,12,117
Michael," What is wrong with you people? Can’t you stick to anything? Erin, I want you to go to the kitchen and get me some vegetables. Creed, you say you want to do a cartwheel? Nothing’s stopping you. Come on, old man, do a cartwheel!",7,12,117
Michael, You’re just gonna somersault around for the rest of your life and you know what’s going to be on your tombstone?  Loser.,7,12,117
Michael, [holding broccoli in front of Kevin] Eat it.,7,12,117
Michael," No. No cheese whiz, no hollandaise, no chocolate sauce, just eat it. Come on. Here comes the airplane, there you go. Open, open, into the hanger, there you go.",7,12,117
Michael," Eat it. Put it in your mouth, and just eat it.",7,12,117
Michael, I don’t care whether you hate it! You said you’d do it! ,7,12,117
Michael," Let me see if you swallowed it, open your mouth. Under your tongue. [reveals hidden broccoli, spits it out] Oh, God! You guys are pathetic. ",7,12,117
Michael," Well, I just want to talk about what happened in there. ",7,12,117
Michael," Holly, come on in. Thanks for coming. I thought there should be an HR rep here for this. So, Kevin and Creed, things got a little bit intense in the conference room.",7,12,117
Michael," And I wanted to apologize. These resolutions should be about you, and I made it about me, and it was none of my beeswax. ",7,12,117
Michael," I really wanted you to follow through on your resolutions. The cartwheel, the veggies… I… care about you. Very much. And you loom so large in my heart that I crossed the line. ",7,12,117
Michael, You’re right. And I hope that we can still be friends. ,7,12,117
Michael, My resolution? I never want to make Holly cry again. Unless it’s from laughing too hard. Or making love too beautifully.   				,7,12,117
Michael, Look at where you’re going to be doing the cartwheel. So look at where you’re going to be placing your hands. So pick a spot.,7,12,117
Michael, You know what? I’m going to stay here as long as it takes.,7,12,117
Michael," Congratulations. All right. Well, all right. See you tomorrow.   				",7,12,117
Michael," Oh no no, I’m not picking on you at all. You’re English, correct?",7,13,118
Michael, I’m working on an English character. Would you mind gi…  It’s called Reginald Pooftah. ,7,13,118
Michael," No, no, no. And people don’t understand that is has nothing to do with making fun of a different nationality. ",7,13,118
Michael," [enters] [in a gruff voice] Hello, I am here for the small business seminar. ",7,13,118
Michael," I am the plant. Every great seminar has one. My job is to make the speaker look good, and I do this through the techniques of leading questions and laughing at all jokes. And the character “Mikanos”, is just a little added flava. “Mikanos” is loosely based on another character I do, “Spiros”, who is more about the ladies.   ",7,13,118
Michael," You know what might be kind of fun?  I was thinking , you know Andy is having a seminar today? What if we went in as a greek couple? Mikanos and… ",7,13,118
Michael," Holly broke up with A.J last week, which is the greatest thing that has ever happened… to me. To Holly, it’s been the worst week of her life, and I know for a fact that there was a week for her in high school when she got mono and her first period ever. Too much information? That’s what I thought. But, you know what? Here I am using it.   ",7,13,118
Michael," [as Mikanos] If-a you change-a you mind, why don’t you talk to Mikanos? ",7,13,118
Michael, Ugh. You’re the fifth person to tell me that today. ,7,13,118
Michael," Okay, yeah, like a character history. Good. Tom Hanks does that.   ",7,13,118
Michael," [as Mikanos] I like the musical “Grease”, or as we call it, “home”. ",7,13,118
Michael, [laughs] I can’t believe-ee. It’s a miracle. She can talk! ,7,13,118
Michael," [as Mikanos] Dah, dah, dah, dah, dah. You know, I like you. I’m going to give you my secret gyro recipe. Come out here since it’s a secret, and I’ll tell you. [exits conference room] [normal voice] All, you have to close right now. ",7,13,118
Michael," No, you’re not. You’re getting past it. You have to close. You can do it. ",7,13,118
Michael," You, Kelly and Creed, Kevin, they believe in you. Don’t let them down. Don’t let yourself down, Andy. I’m gonna go back in. I’m going to stall them for a little bit. I want you to get your head together, and then come back in. I want you to close. [entering conference room] [as Mikanos] What is taking that guy so long?   ",7,13,118
Michael," [as Mikanos] Almost as good as the first day when we first met. You are the love of my life. Come to me, Necropolis. Put your lips on my lips. Come on. ",7,13,118
Michael, What? Come on. It’s time for grapes. [regular voice] Real fun day.   ,7,13,118
Michael, Just a minute. How long do we have to wait?,7,14,119
Michael," I don’t understand. I really don’t. I mean, we know we are going to start dating. Why not now?",7,14,119
Michael, Why does the sun rise in the morning? Why do magnets stick together? Because everybody says so. Everybody. ,7,14,119
Michael," Yeah, I understand. I just don’t agree. ",7,14,119
Michael, I have my own opinion and my opinion is to disagree with you. ,7,14,119
Michael, Just drive faster. I want to get back. ,7,14,119
Michael," Okay, fine. My feelings don’t matter to you. What matters to you is your precious speed limit. ",7,14,119
Michael," No I’m not. I’m not in a bad mood. I’m not, Jim. Hello? Ok fine, ignore me. Have it your way. Let’s just talk about you, as always. Is sex different after the baby, Jim? ",7,14,119
Michael, What part of “I need to pee” do you not understand? I’m upset. My bladder is full. There is no telling what I might do right now all over the inside of your precious little car. ,7,14,119
Michael," I know, I know you have a phone policy. I understand. But this is an emergency because my friend isn’t here and I am worried that he has been abducted. ",7,14,119
Michael, There is no way he ditched me. There is no way that happened. He’s my… Ok. May I please just use your phone? Please! ,7,14,119
Michael," Ok. I will make it quick. I will make it very quick. [opens phone] And you don’t have my numbers on speed dial. Ah, Ok. What is it? ",7,14,119
Michael," You know what, I can dial 411, get Jim’s number. ",7,14,119
Michael," Actually this is good. I am going to take this opportunity to go walk-about. Good. Good. [to cameras] Nope, get away. No, that’s enough. Ok.   ",7,14,119
Michael, [at puppies] Hey you guys. Listen to me. Don’t get hung up on just one girl because there are a whole lot of other girls out there. Look over there. See? They look cute. [at parrots] Hello! You guys are so beautiful. You’re so colorful. I wish I could understand you. That’s a metaphor I guess. [at snake] You are disgusting. You’ll never find love. Yekkk. [holding puppy] Do you think she needs more time or is it never going to happen? [licks his nose] I’m being serious. Seriously.   ,7,14,119
Michael," Hello. I would like a hot dog please. Now, I don’t have any money so here is what I would like to do. I leave you here with my watch, and I come back later to pay for the hot dog. ",7,14,119
Michael, Well I understand that but this is a $45 watch.,7,14,119
Michael, All right. What do you do with the hog dogs that you don’t sell?,7,14,119
Michael," Well, okay, instead of throwing them all away later, why don’t you just throw one away now into my mouth?",7,14,119
Michael," Oh, boy. That was yummy. Thank you so much. You know what? I think I left my wallet in my car. Do you mind if I run out and get it?",7,14,119
Michael, Okay. I’ll be right back. [goes to leave but walks back]. Okay. You know what? I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I don’t have my wallet and I was gonna try to dine and dash and that was stupid and I realize I can’t do that to you fine people. ,7,14,119
Michael," Well I can, but I will have to come back later tonight and pay you. But the point is I did the right thing.",7,14,119
Michael, Well the number three is not such a giant feast. ,7,14,119
Michael, I am not. I just have had a bad day.  And I… okay. I’ll be back later with the money. I’m just gonna leave right now. ,7,14,119
Michael," Well, I think I can get through the door.   ",7,14,119
Michael, Hi. [laughs] How did you know I was up here? ,7,14,119
Michael, I got turned around. I thought I could see Dunder Mifflin. ,7,14,119
Michael, Yeah. [laughs] Wow. I just miss you so much. ,7,14,119
Michael, Miss you. Okay. I’ll be in my office if you need me. ,7,15,120
Michael," Okay, bye. Bye. All right, bye. Bye… bye. ",7,15,120
Michael, Don’t go. I don’t want you to go. Oh don’t go. Don’t go.   				,7,15,120
Michael," Holly and I are dating. It’s been a week, and I still can’t believe it. [sighs] It goes to show that everything you want in life, you get. And you can’t work for it. It just comes to you.   				",7,15,120
Michael, [rubbing hands with Holly] Are these numbers correct? ,7,15,120
Michael," Are you… are you sick, Oscar? Do you need to go home? ‘Cause you’re grossing me out. ",7,15,120
Michael," Sit. Okay, just close your eyes. [massaging Holly’s back]",7,15,120
Michael," [sitting in Holly’s lap] Yes. Michael Scott, Dunder Mifflin. What is the purpose of this meeting?",7,15,120
Michael, Perfect. Yes. It is quite apro-propriate. Carry on. ,7,15,120
Michael," What, are you talking about me and Holly? ",7,15,120
Michael, Whispering and tickling have their place in business. ,7,15,120
Michael," I… Okay, yeah, that’s pretty hot. I will give you that. Look, you are all hypocrites. You all do it. ",7,15,120
Michael, You win. But here’s what we are going to do. We are going to designate one of our closets as a hook-up zone. ,7,15,120
Michael," Okay, then we have two closets. No, no, we’re gonna have three closets, one for each base, no homers. Yes?",7,15,120
Michael," No, no, it’s great. I love working at Dunder Mifflin, a division of Taliban enterprises.   				",7,15,120
Michael," Ah, the old “leave behind.” Oldest trick in the book. Good thing it’s working. ",7,15,120
Michael," Since when is comfort the most important thing? I mean, I don’t… I don’t sit on your lap because it’s comfortable. I sit on your lap because I like the way your thighs feel on my butt. ",7,15,120
Michael," Oh. Okay. Well, if it makes you uncomfortable, then we’ll stop. ",7,15,120
Michael, Holly and I are like Romeo and Juliet. And this office is like the dragon that kept them apart.   				,7,15,120
Michael," Hey, you know why people here are complaining? They are jealous of two people in love on Valentine’s Day. ",7,15,120
Michael, I am really disappointed in the office’s policy on PDA at this moment. I love you. [shakes Holly’s hand],7,15,120
Michael," Yeah, whatever. No big deal. Just the hottest girl in the world loves me.   				",7,15,120
Michael," No touching. Ah, I’m trying not to touch you. ",7,15,120
Michael," Oh, no, so close. Oh. No, we can’t do that. We can’t do this. Ohh. ",7,15,120
Michael, I don’t know what your body feels like ’cause I can’t touch it. ,7,15,120
Michael, I will grab you here anyway. [laughs]  				,7,15,120
Michael," I did say I would, but I was wrong. I can’t stop. You don’t what it is like to love a woman and have her love you back. It is a feeling that cannot and will not, and frankly, cannot be contained. ",7,15,120
Michael, I haven’t thought about you having to go back to Nashua. ,7,15,120
Michael, That’s what we said last time. Remember? We broke up on the drive. How’s this gonna be any different? ,7,15,120
Michael," …is ticking down. When it goes off, no more kissing. No more hugging. ",7,15,120
Michael, [into recorder] Boner Bomb starring Jason Statham. Or we go against type with an Eisenberg or a Michael Cera.,7,15,120
Michael, No. [into recorder] Saving the world has never been this hard. ,7,15,120
Michael," No, I can’t talk to her. I can’t even look at her without thinking about it ending. ",7,15,120
Michael, Don’t do the squirrel. Throw your poop. ,7,15,120
Michael," Holly, I love you so, so, so much. And I think we need to break up. ",7,15,120
Michael," Actually, it’s Valentine’s Day. Shouldn’t be doing this today. I’ll talk to you tomorrow. ",7,15,120
Michael," You’re gonna go back to Nashua eventually, and I can’t handle it. So let’s just…let’s…",7,15,120
Michael," Ladies and gentlemen, I have an announcement to make. As of today, officially, Holly and I are moving into together. Yay! [claps] Thank you. Thank you. Oscar, this must be tough for you, watching this go down. You could not stand in the way of true love, my friend!",7,15,120
Michael," Well, the point is, there will no longer be any need for PDA here at the office between us because, when we get home, we are going to make love to and with one another, and that, to me, is the best Valentine’s Day present that a person could receive. So I bid you all adieu. ",7,15,120
Michael, [pulls out two handguns and kills the man with an unnecessarily large amount of bullets] Clean up on aisle five. [Threat Level:,7,16,121
Michael," After three years of writing, one year of shooting, four years of re-shooting and two years of editing, I have finally completed my movie, Threat Level:",7,16,121
Michael," That’s… That’s. Well, don’t put words in my mouth.  ",7,16,121
Michael," Mhmm! It’s got action, it’s got heart, it’s got some bosom.",7,16,121
Michael, [lying on bed with a bottle of alcohol] I’m up.,7,16,121
Michael," [holding a quarter up] Heads I do it, tails I don’t. Best out of seven. [flips the coin] Heads. [flips it again] Tails. [President winces each time he says tails]…Heads…Tails…Heads…Tails. [flips one more time and the quarter spins around on the table. Michael looks at it] Well, it looks like there’s going to be a clean-up on aisle five.",7,16,121
Michael," I’m not here to learn how to mop, I’m here to learn how to play hockey.",7,16,121
Michael," [Michael and Goldenface skate around the rink, Goldenface shooting with a solid gold gun, Michael with two pistols. Michael is out of breath at the end of the race] Nice try Goldenface, but you forgot one thing, to kill me.",7,16,121
Michael, I am sorry that I have to do this… [starts choking Oscar to death with his towel],7,16,121
Michael," Not who, what. The Funky Cat is the hippest Jazz Club in town. [stands up with his cup of tea and walks by Samuel, pouring his tea all over him]",7,16,121
Michael, [pulls out a recording device from his pocket and clicks it on],7,16,121
Michael," By far and away, the most expensive shot in the movie. But, it was integral to the story.  ",7,16,121
Michael," The joke’s on you Goldenface, that man was a wanted animal rapist.",7,16,121
Michael," It’ll take a lot more than a bullet to the brain, lungs, heart, back, and balls to kill Michael Scarn.",7,16,121
Michael," For the insurance money! I knew it all along! [the President, Goldenface, and his minion pull out automatic machine guns] You will never get away with this! [takes a painting of Abraham Lincoln and awkwardly smashes it on the President’s head, runs out of the office as Goldenface and his minion shoot at them]",7,16,121
Michael," Where had I gone wrong? All I wanted was to start a family with my beautiful wife. But somewhere along the way, things got messed up.",7,16,121
Michael, [laughs to himself] Don’t ever change Billy. Goldenface is going to blow up the NHL All Star Game tomorrow.,7,16,121
Michael, I’m too depressed to save the big game Billy.,7,16,121
Michael," No Billy, I haven’t done that dance since my wife died.",7,16,121
Michael," [A funky beat sounds from the Jukebox and Michael starts dancing poorly] Well my name’s Michael Scarn and I’m here to say, I’m about to do The Scarn in a major way. [the bachelorettes and the others in the bar stand up to join him] You jump to the right and you shake a hand and you jump to the left and you shake that hand. You meet new friends, and tie that yarn, and that’s how you do The Scarn! [doing the actions he says to] You jump to the right and you shake a hand and you jump to the left and you shake that hand. You meet new friends, and tie that yarn, and that’s how you do The Scarn! You jump to the right and you shake a hand and you jump to the left and you shake that hand. You meet new friends, and tie that yarn, and that’s how you do The Scarn!",7,16,121
Michael," [turns off the movie from the remote, the office complains]",7,16,121
Michael," [to Holly] Well that’s a… pretty good reaction. [Holly nods] Pretty cool, right? Did you like it? Did you like that?",7,16,121
Michael," Okay. [Stands up and leaves the conference room to the dismay of the office] No, it’s not good enough. It’s not good enough…",7,16,121
Michael," Mmmm, good? Everybody out there says it’s great!",7,16,121
Michael," No, no. Holly, this isn’t Ocean’s Eleven, where you get together with all your friends and just have fun and don’t care about how it turns out. What’d you really think, honestly.",7,16,121
Michael," Is it, is it because you’re afraid of where this is gonna take me? See, because I need you… to keep me grounded.",7,16,121
Michael," [angrily] It was eleven years, okay? This has been my dream for eleven years, and if you don’t think it’s great than you’re basically saying that you don’t believe in my dream.",7,16,121
Michael," I talk about a lot of things, Holly! I was eventually gonna get around to my dream! Obviously! Eleven years I could’ve been working on the Scarn Nebulus.",7,16,121
Michael," Because, if I don’t have this, what do I have? I have nothing.",7,16,121
Michael," I have my book on business, Somehow I Manage. I have my HBO comedy special, Here I Go Again dot-dot-dot. But you know what? When I think about it, when I really think about it, none of those things are as real to me as my movie.",7,16,121
Michael," Yeah, you’re a real pain in the ass. And I’m gonna go watch the movie with people who think it’s great! And I’m sorry I called you a pain in the ass, I’m angry, and I love you.",7,16,121
Michael," I am a huge Woody Allen fan. Although I’ve only seen Antz, but I’ll tell you something. What I respect about that man, is that when he was going through all that stuff that came out in the press, about how Antz was just a rip-off of A Bug’s Life, he stayed true to his films.  Or at least the film that I saw which again was Antz. The thing is… I thought Bug’s Life was better, much better. Than Ants. The point is, don’t listen to your critics, listen to your fans.  ",7,16,121
Michael," I know, it’s a good thing my trainer and mentor is here to cheer me on!",7,16,121
Michael, [crying] This one’s for you Cherokee Jack. [Michael skates into the rink of an already in-play match],7,16,121
Michael," We filmed this during an actual Scranton High School Hockey Game, trying to qualify for states.  ",7,16,121
Michael," No, no! Actually it’s really screwed up because they [chuckles], they were trying to qualify, they were disqualified, they had to forfeit the game. Undefeated season. That’s why there were so many people there. [Michael stands up, clearly realizing that his movie is not as great as he thought]  ",7,16,121
Michael," No it’s not. [kisses Holly while smiling] It’s not. But, they really seem to be enjoying it.  ",7,16,121
Michael, [ees Cherokee Jack from a confusion of heavenly light and smoke] Cherokee Jack.,7,16,121
Michael," [skates forward, hits the puck, and stares in wonder as it flies by]",7,16,121
Michael, [in Scarn manor] Some breakfast for me [shows a plate of bacon and eggs] and some breakfast for you. [pulls out an oil can and oils Samuel’s circuit board on his back],7,16,121
Michael," Oh yeah, I guess I did let him be a robot.  ",7,16,121
Michael, [phone rings] I’ll get it! Man I love being retired! Scarn here!,7,16,121
Michael," No, no Dwight. He’s just being stupid. [the office laughs]  ",7,16,121
Michael," It was the best of times, it was the awesomest of times. And now Packer wants to come home. And ohh, look who’s here to sign off on it! My boo, Holly.  				",7,17,122
Michael," Oh, yes yes yes yes. Just so you know, he’s at his funniest when you’ve given him five shots. ",7,17,122
Michael, And it also helps if you’ve had five shots.,7,17,122
Michael," [peering into conference room] Don’t know, don’t care.",7,17,122
Michael," [sees Holly and Todd shaking hands in the conference room] Yes! The Pack is back! Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to introduce you to a man who needs no introduction, probably because most of you have done it with him. Just kidding he wouldn’t be interested in any of you. In all seriousness, Todd Packer, is a permanent salesman at this branch. And I would like to invite you to welcome him with open arms.",7,17,122
Michael," You did! You got burned, because Packer’s back! Packer is turning in his car for a desk. He is turning in his condoms, for a condominium! Although he’s probably going to have to use condoms from here on out.",7,17,122
Michael, Special delivery for Dwight K. Schrute.,7,17,122
Michael, And I don’t have anything for you. But I do wanna talk to you about something. We have been thinking about where Packer should sit… And we can’t just sit around and wait for Creed to die.,7,17,122
Michael," So you wouldn’t mind permanently relocating, so that Packer can take this desk here. [Jim looks appalled]",7,17,122
Michael, [Grunting as he crawls under Dwight’s desk. Dwight follows] Let’s look at this.,7,17,122
Michael, Don’t be a baby! Okay! There it is. Packer was here and so was your mom! [Todd starts humping Dwight and Michael who are still under the desk.,7,17,122
Michael," Question, should I get stripes shaved on the side of my head?",7,17,122
Michael," Yeah, You love him right? [Holly seems unsure] You love him. I can tell.",7,17,122
Michael," Whoa! Look, are you jealous of him? Because you think he’s funnier than you? Oh honey…",7,17,122
Michael, So I’m less funny than not funny at all?,7,17,122
Michael," And you made Hank smile, that doesn’t happen often. You’re very charming. That is something you should take upstairs, and use on people that really matter. [Hank looks irritated again]",7,17,122
Michael," I don’t know, Holly mentioned that there were some complaints. And that you had said some things about Kevin.",7,17,122
Michael, I guess you said something weird about your daughter?,7,17,122
Michael," You’ve been on the road a long time. And you’ve been an outdoor cat. And now you have to be an indoor cat, so you can’t be peeing all over the walls.",7,17,122
Michael," [Michael and Todd are walking into the office] Okay, every body. I need you to see this. Because maybe there is somebody here that you all underestimated, who will surprise you. Todd Packer, is going to apologize. Kevin! Front and center, come here.",7,17,122
Michael," Kevin, we know that you are just trying to save face, we know that you are hurt and embarrassed.",7,17,122
Michael," Okay, sweetie, no. You shouldn’t be apologizing to Packer. That doesn’t make any sense. You ready for this? You ready for this? Gentlemen, start your engines.",7,17,122
Michael," That-That was maybe too much. Packer is a survivor of divorce Stanley. Packer doesn’t speak with his child, Meredith. Packer never lived up to his parent’s expectations, Andy. [Andy looks confused and shrugs] Angela loves pussy cats, and Packer loves-",7,17,122
Michael," I was going to say dogs! Okay, you know what, this is over! Apology has been issued! And we’re through with it. Packer will be here until the day he dies, just like the rest of us!  				",7,17,122
Michael," I cannot believe this, you’re sending Packer to Florida? Why?",7,17,122
Michael," Okay, so you’re tricking him into flying to Florida?",7,17,122
Michael, You have to tell him. You have to tell him what you did.,7,17,122
Michael," He is my oldest friend, I am going to tell him.",7,17,122
Michael, Well… I don’t know if that’s a good idea.,7,17,122
Michael, That is. [Jim sees them and looks happy] It’s gonna be awesome. I think you’re really going to enjoy it down there.  				,7,17,122
Michael, [kisses her and speaks normally again] You ahh.  				,7,17,122
Michael, I uh… I actually don’t know why I brought that because It’s kind of priceless.,7,18,123
Michael, You know it’s really more for a bachelor pad. I just want to get a fair price.,7,18,123
Michael, I don’t have an in case. Do you have an in case?,7,18,123
Michael," [on phone] Yes, hello Mr. Flax this is Michael Scott, your daughter’s boss. I am calling because I am going to have to fire your daughter Holly because she is such a terrible employee. I’m just kidding. I’m kidding. I’m actually calling because I’m in love with her. I love your daughter, and I have for some time. And I would like to discuss my intentions with you… which are to ask her to marry me. And I was just hoping you would give me your approval. And this isn’t a joke. So call me back, when you get this. And I look forward to speaking. Thank you.  				",7,18,123
Michael," Oh, you know what, you have a siphon? I think I’m gonna run out of gas.",7,18,123
Michael, Hey you know what? I’ve got gas all over my hands and my shoes. Would you light it? Would you do the honors please?,7,18,123
Michael, Ok. Thank you all for coming. I would like to talk to you all today about… recycling.,7,18,123
Michael," No, no, no, no. My minds made up I am not going to change my mind you can’t talk me out of it.",7,18,123
Michael, I had a great idea until you ruined it.,7,18,123
Michael," How about this I throw a corpse dressed like me off of the roof, it hits the ground, the head pops off, this leads me to the line ‘ I lost my head when I fell in love with you.’",7,18,123
Michael," It’s easy enough to get a corpse, you just go to a med school. I already have the ring.",7,18,123
Michael, That mush have been a surprise when… at the gas station you proposed.,7,18,123
Michael, Oh yea you didn’t say that the weather was bad that sounds perfect. I want this to be an event that everyone talks about always and forever.,7,18,123
Michael, I know but I’m still scared I don’t know why.,7,18,123
Michael, Get this… Kevin thought I was gonna sell my Bowflex for 200 dollars and I told him ‘Dude this was a prop in my movie.’,7,18,123
Michael," Ok it’s because we haven’t sold anything. You know what? We just wait until the end of the day, people get desperate, and they’re gonna pay anything.",7,18,123
Michael," Yeah, yeah well you definitely need to do that.",7,18,123
Michael," No, no, shhhhut it. Mhmm. Oh God. Nope, nope, nope.  				",7,18,123
Michael, No. I am not going to be proposed to in the break room. That is not going to be our story. Mhm hm. Should have burned this place down when I had the chance.  				,7,18,123
Michael, That’s great and we still have most of our stuff. Good.,7,18,123
Michael," No, no, no, no, lets not talk about that.",7,18,123
Michael, Shhhh. Let’s go on a little walk. You know what? I wanna show you some stuff.  				,7,18,123
Michael, So this is one of my favorite places in the world.,7,18,123
Michael, This is where Toby announced that he was going to Costa Rica. Happiest day of my life. Until the day you came to replace him. Let’s go in here.   				,7,18,123
Michael, And this is where we first made love. Remember what I tried there?,7,18,123
Michael," Through these blinds is where I first saw you, and you had all these boxes, and I thought you were the prettiest mover I had ever seen. And I was sitting at this desk when I called you to tell you that I had herpes and that I was still in love with you and you said that it was over, and that you didn’t love me. Thank goodness none of that was true. Including the herpes. ",7,18,123
Michael," Right in here… this is where we first co-ran our meeting. Remember, obesity awareness?",7,18,123
Michael, We saved a lot of lives that day. That’s where you first met Michael Klump.,7,18,123
Michael," And right over there is where you found out that Meredith was prostituting herself for Outback steak. And I will never forget that you had the cutest look on your face because you couldn’t believe it, you thought it was so wrong.  				",7,18,123
Michael,"  Well, nothing. Nothing really. I would just find an excuse to come here so I could stare at you through that window. This is what I’d do. [runs water through hand]",7,18,123
Michael," This is where our love faces its toughest test. After this, its just smooth sailing for the rest of our lives.",7,18,123
Michael, That guy’s got more than he can handle as it is.,7,18,123
Michael, That would be hot. I would pay to see that.,7,18,123
Michael, Only one that I was kind of worried about.,7,18,123
Michael," [the area where Holly’s desk is is filled with lit candles] This is where I fell in love with you. And this is where I ask you to marry me. It started with.. [fire sprinklers go on] Holly Flax, marrying me will you be?",7,18,123
Michael," Thank you. So guys, guys, guys. We’re moving to Colorado.",7,18,123
Michael, Holly has to go back to Colorado. I’m going with her. I’m leaving.  				,7,18,123
Michael," Actually, I am meeting somebody, but I’m a little bit early. Leaving my company. After 19 years.",7,19,124
Michael," And to middles, the unsung heroes. And to moms.",7,19,124
Michael, Do not tell my fiance I’m drinking on a Wednesday. ,7,19,124
Michael," I’m moving out to the burbs… actually, I’m moving further than the burbs, I’m moving to Colorado.",7,19,124
Michael," No, no. I don’t want to end up like Sunny Bobo.",7,19,124
Michael," You know, I would like to try the luge, through.",7,19,124
Michael, Oh… wow. The mountains. Where things are.,7,19,124
Michael," Man, he is late. I’m gonna call him. Do you mind? I’m sorry. [calls Deangelo, Deangelo’s phone vibrates]",7,19,124
Michael," No, I’m here. I’m right… I’m at the bar. ",7,19,124
Michael," I’m been here about… gosh, over half an hour.",7,19,124
Michael," I see your voice in the phone. Oh, man! [holds out hand] Michael Scott.",7,19,124
Michael, [entering Dunder Mifflin offices] Here we go! Are you ready?,7,19,124
Michael," [pops up from below camera, and runs out of room]",7,19,124
Michael," Ok, everyone, as you know, one of my favorite things is fanfare for it’s own sake. So, without further ado, let’s start clapping! Presenting Deangelo Vickers! ",7,19,124
Michael," And we talk for like 20 minutes, no clue it’s Deangelo the whole time!",7,19,124
Michael," I happen to like the hilarious hijinx I get myself into. There he is! Deangelo, I was just telling them about last night, when we met. Remember that? That was crazy!",7,19,124
Michael, Oh yeah… I know… that’s what I was just saying… that’s what…,7,19,124
Michael," This is Jim and Pam, aka Jap. What started as an affair has blossomed into a family before our eyes.",7,19,124
Michael, Are you kidding? I’d come anywhere to see a turtle? Where’d you find him.,7,19,124
Michael, Now I’m gonna have to go online and look at turtles or I’ll be off all day.,7,19,124
Michael, So you decided to have an orgy and not invite me? I call the middle!,7,19,124
Michael," I know, I know, I’m sorry, but if it’s not a big deal we should just-",7,19,124
Michael," Well, whatever. Whatever you think will work.",7,19,124
Michael, You can do the old way or whatever you think would work. [phone rings],7,19,124
Michael, [to Erin] Shave me. [walks into office with Deangelo] This is going to be funny! Looks like we are going to be shaving buddies!,7,19,124
Michael," And this is Erin and she is going to shave my face. Here we go. [Erin puts too much shaving cream on Michael’s face, none on the neck] ",7,19,124
Michael," It really does. This is luxery. Here we go. Ah, that is nice.",7,19,124
Michael," Well, we don’t really do rap sessions. We kinda do… [Erin shaves Michael] god… we sorta do more of like powwows or-",7,19,124
Michael," You know what, everybody? You have to be honest, here. You can’t say that everything is perfect. So, you know, come up with something.",7,19,124
Michael," Ok, you know what, I mark it urgent A, urgent B, urgent C, urgent D. Urgent A is the most important, urgent D you don’t even really have to worry about.",7,19,124
Michael," You know, this office sort of has a perfect Feng Shui to it, so… you know, let’s not go overboard with the re-decorating, and I’m still here-",7,19,124
Michael," I still have to look at this stuff, guys.",7,19,124
Michael," Deangelo’s great. I love the guy. But I’m not sure he’s a great fit for the office. And also, I’m not sure if I love the guy.  				",7,19,124
Michael, [interrupting Deangelo] Snack time! It’s the witching hour! It’s the sandwitching hour!,7,19,124

Michael, No one had a problem with the air here until you came around.,7,19,124
Michael," No, that’s good. You just stay in there, stay in there by yourself, loser. No body go in. [disgusted comments by co-workers] No body go in there. Stay where you are.",7,19,124
Michael," No, it’s not insane, Oscar. I’m been here for 19 years, and just because someone else is called the boss, you’re gonna throw it all away? No. ",7,19,124
Michael," Well, who needs him. Guess it’s just you and me, Dwight.",7,19,124
Michael," I start with some chit-chat and a maybe a couple of jokes. And you might want to develop a couple of characters. You know what, you’ll be fine.",7,19,124
Michael, Ok. [hugs Deangelo from behind] Why did you have to be so damn good?,7,19,124
Michael," No, no, no. Come on. You are good, they know it.",7,19,124
Michael," Every year! This happens, you have a lot to learn my friend. [DeAngelo laughs]",7,20,125
Michael, Why do you always say that? You’re gonna love it.  				,7,20,125

Michael, [walking into the office] Good morning Erin.,7,20,125
Michael, You are getting so funny! [Erin giggles] Very good.  				,7,20,125
Michael," The Dundies are my baby, and they need to go on. When Larry King died they didn’t just cancel his show. They got Pierce Morgan to come in, and do his show, and, that way, Larry lives on.  				",7,20,125
Michael, Anything can happen at the Dundies! [DeAngelo laughs] They’re like the Golden Globes but less mean. And I just want all of us to have a good time!,7,20,125
Michael," A la, tonight we will be hosting at Louie Volpies!",7,20,125
Michael," Shh, shh! Okay, okay. Everybody’s right. They’re like breadsticks on steroids. Right?",7,20,125
Michael," So as you know, the Dundies are my legacy. So I’m going to need to train a replacement. So this year, I have decided to have a co-host. [Dwight looks suspecting] And that person is [he and DeAngelo roll their tongues as a drum roll] DeAngelo! [all applaud]  				",7,20,125
Michael, [all in conference room] Guys! I want you to help us work on some banter.,7,20,125

Michael," [cutting him off] Okay, okay. You know what, I didn’t actually lose my keys…",7,20,125
Michael, Mmmmkay. There needs to be what you call a rat-a-tat. And right now it’s all rat and no tat. Ryan come on up here. Tap DeAngelo out. Just watch this. Okay. [Ryan stands next to Michael up front] Ryan how are you today?,7,20,125
Michael, [very excited] There you go! Lovely! Regis and Kelly! Nice! Use that as an inspiration.  Just be funny.,7,20,125
Michael," No, no, no! This is the performance of your life!",7,20,125
Michael," This is my last Dundies ever, if I want mind control over him, is that too much to ask?  				",7,20,125
Michael," Now, tell me something terrible that happened in your childhood.",7,20,125
Michael," [getting off his stomach] Too personal. I don’t wanna hear about it. [picking up a portable tape player] Let’s try this. Put these on. [DeAngelo puts the headphones in] I am going to turn this on, and turn the volume all the way up. So you can’t- [DeAngelo winces] That’s right, you’re not going to be able to hear yourself.

Michael, [also in a poor Australian accent] The Dundies!,7,20,125
Michael, I’m here. [DeAngelo gasps and turns around] In a good way! I’ve been here the whole time.  				,7,20,125
Michael," [in the bathroom] DeAngelo, what are you doing? There’s a live audience out there!",7,20,125
Michael," No, Ryan would never do it. It’s too on the radar. Look, look. The boss, hosts, the Dundies! It’s sort of our perk!",7,20,125
Michael," Listen to me, you’re not doing this for me, you’re not doing this for you, you’re not even doing this for them!",7,20,125
Michael," [slaps him] You’re doing this for all those kids out there, eating off the Louie Volpies kid’s menu, wondering: Does it get better? What I want you to do, is I want you to say: It’s showtime. Get out there.  ",7,20,125
Michael," Now hit me. [DeAngelo slaps him] One, two, three.",7,20,125
Michael, Okay! Okay! Sorry about the delay everybody! But we were at the DMV waiting in line. [everyone laughs],7,20,125
Michael," There are a lot of great salesmen in this office, but one of our great salesmen is also a great dad. And a close personal friend of mine, Jim Halpert! Best Dad Dundie! [Dwight plays a celebratory honking noise on his keyboard]",7,20,125
Michael," Which moves us to, Best Mom Dundie. [Pam gets ready and Jim smiles at her] I guess we all kinda consider her a mom around the office. Meredith Palmer!",7,20,125
Michael," Year after year, I catch a lot of flak on this particular award, because year after year I present this award to a guy instead of a girl. Hottest in the office goes to, [Ryan stands up] Danny Cordray! [Ryan quickly sits] Danny couldn’t be here tonight…  				",7,20,125
Michael," Stanley Hudson is a grump, everybody knows that. [Stanley looks angry] But did you know, that Stanley Hudson is also the face of a debilitating disease known as diabetes. The Diabetes Award goes to Stanley Hudson! [Stanley slowly walks over, angry] Come on up here you sick bastard.  				",7,20,125
Michael," You know, herpes affects one in five sexually active adults? [manager looks up, angrily at Michael] Pippy Longstocking, Ronald McDonald’s wife, Ron Howard, Ron Weasley, what do thay all have in common? Red heads. Erin Hannon, come on up here and receive your Cutest Red Head in the Office Award! [Erin looks thrilled and walks up to the stage]",7,20,125
Michael," It is difficult to recognize the person who will be replacing you. But he is a good guy, so the Michael Scott Award for Best Dundies Host goes to DeAngelo Vickers. [DeAngelo jogs up and takes the Dundie and tries to go back to his seat]",7,20,125
Michael," [stopping Manager] DeAngelo is expressing himself. [manager pulls the microphone cable, everyone can still here DeAngelo.",7,20,125
Michael," [Outside of the restaurant, obviously sad] So that is how it ends. My last Dundies ever. I was hoping it’d be more like Godfather Three. That rapped up the whole franchise in an extremely satisfying way. But instead it is like Godfather One! That was, very confusing, had maybe three big laughs. Oh well…",7,20,125
Michael," No, no. You’re being too hard on yourself. We had a very truncated rehearsal time.",7,20,125
Michael," So what you’re saying is you kinda like it? [Phyllis impression] I’ve fallen and I can’t get up! [normal again] That Phyllis bit, that was pretty good.",7,20,125
Michael," [to Stanley, who is cracking up again] You were laughing right?",7,20,125
Michael," That’s true, we wouldn’t get seats together.",7,20,125
Michael," [in the car] You know, despite a couple hiccups, I think that went very well.  ",7,20,125
Michael, Man! Maybe you should have won the Kind of a Bitch Award.,7,20,125
Michael," Okay! That, that is unfair! The clothing was safe, but tasteful.",7,20,125
Michael," [in conference room] Here… [Andy walks in] Okay! By his own omission, this person actually tried marijuana in college, so the Doobie Doobie Pothead Stoner of the Year Award goes to, Andy Bernard! [Andy walks up]",7,20,125
Michael," [choked up] Yeah, okay. [pauses, then takes a deep breath] Well this is gonna hurt like a mother[bleep].  				",7,20,125
Michael, Here he comes! Alright! You deserve it! [Toby comes up and take the mic],7,20,125
Michael," [Michael takes one and bites] Oh, these do not taste like oysters.",7,21,126
Michael," I don’t own Dunder Mifflin, okay? [Dwight scoffs] The job was not mine to give. [sighs] Look, I need your advice on something. I am told that there are bears in the Rockies.",7,21,126
Michael," Well, I was just thinking that maybe I should keep a salami in my pocket…",7,21,126
Michael," Okay, so no salami in the pants. How about a pepperoni?",7,21,126
Michael," Yes. Yes, you know what? Take my favorite truck. Sure.",7,21,126
Michael," Sad? No, no, no. I don’t leave ’til tomorrow, so… Tomorrow I will be a wreck.  				",7,21,126

Michael,"  Tomorrow I want everyone to have a good time. No drama. And as for today, just a typical day. Alright?",7,21,126
Michael, Sounds good. Fudge it up! [all seem surprised at Michael’s behavior]  				,7,21,126
Michael," [holding up his “World’s Best Boss Mug”] I bought this for myself. And yesterday, they gave me this. [holds up a Dundie that reads, ‘World’s Best Boss 2011, Michael G. Scott’, throws his mug into the garbage can and places his Dundie at the front of his desk] I still need something to drink out of though.  				",7,21,126
Michael," [pulls out a list of everyone in the office, then puts it back in his jacket] Attention everyone, before I leave tomorrow I would like to reveal a secret I have kept for over twenty years. A secret about Phyllis.",7,21,126
Michael," When Phyllis was in high school, she was so… cute. [Phyllis looks relieved] And she still is.  				",7,21,126
Michael," [hesitantly] Sounds great, I just think it’s great. Oh, I have gifts as well! [goes into his office and comes out with a bag] And I will start, by giving the first gift to Phyllis! Phyllis, you are shy and sweet, and you don’t often speak your mind, but you should. Because you have great ideas. So Phyllis, I am giving you this, so you can always remember to speak your mind. [presents to her a mouth wind-up chattering toy]",7,21,126
Michael," Stanley, you love your Sudoku and your puzzles, I bestow upon you, my felt. [gives Stanley a small felt table] May you never lose the fun loving quality in life.",7,21,126
Michael," Well, okay… And Andy, Andy who needs confidence  that he is a great salesman. I give you, my clients, our ten most important accounts. [other salesmen look outraged]",7,21,126

Michael," You sold us all on Andy, a product that nobody wanted.",7,21,126
Michael, Just do your best! I have faith in you.,7,21,126
Michael," [rips the poster in half] Don’t be a caricature Kevin, never be a caricature. How did that feel when I tore that up?",7,21,126
Michael," Good, stand up. [Kevin does so] You will be thin. You Won’t drool over pizza like an animal anymore.",7,21,126
Michael," Don’t be. You should never settle for who you are. [moving on] Oscar, Oscar, Oscar! Oscar, you are-",7,21,126
Michael," [quietly groans] Okay, you know what? Just do your best buddy! Okay, Oscar, you are very smart, and you have a gigantic education. And, I think of you as my scarecrow, because you gave me a brain. So that’s why I made you this. [takes a sack tied in the upper middle making a crude head, with a face drawn on, obviously the product of poor craftsmanship, Oscar pretends to like it]",7,21,126
Michael," [laughing] It looks like a [more laughing] It looks like it was made by a two year old monkey on a farm! He just accepted, accepted that I put all this work into it! [laughs more] He has the lowest opinion of me, of anybody!  				",7,21,126
Michael," Was it just me, or did you think that we were going to have sex at some point?",7,21,126

Michael, Who’s that? Who’s that guy? [points to second guy in the pictures],7,21,126
Michael," [crying] I can’t do this. All the channels are gonna be different there. I’m not gonna be able to find my shows. I’m not going to start improv at level one, and I don’t think my credits will transfer. Ugh, and you know what? I just figured out where I was supposed to go to vote.

Michael, Okay. I’ll see you tonight. I love you.,7,21,126
Michael," [hangs up and composes himself] Yes, so I know I told everybody that tomorrow is my last day, but I’m, I’m gonna be leaving tonight. I head to the airport at four.

Michael," [still trying the backwards basket] Catch you guys- [forklift drives in front of the camera] Catch you guys on the filippity flip. [misses and picks it up again] Flippity flip! [misses again and grabs it back] Flippity flip! [makes it in, gets excited] Really? [composes himself] Okay, see ya guys! [walks away, containing his self-pleasure]  				",7,21,126
Michael," Erin, listen to me. You shouldn’t rush into this. At all. And you know why? Because you are beautiful. And you are fun. And you are smart. [Erin is smiling] And when the right guy comes along, you’ll know it. You will. [kisses her head] And you know what? You don’t need a mom. Because you have my number, and you can call me anytime.",7,21,126
Michael," Okay. [both chuckling. Michael leaves Erin, looking thoughtful]  				",7,21,126
Michael," Listen to me. It’s two p.m. From now until four, your priority is knitting. Knit like the wind.",7,21,126
Michael," Dwight, I will be leaving tomorrow. [pulls out an envelope from his jacket]",7,21,126
Michael, So I wanted to give you that. [hands him the envelope] It’s a letter of recommendation. [Dwight looks eager. Michael nods to him and walks away]  				,7,21,126
Michael," [in the office, crosses Dwight off his list. He has paint in his messed up hair, and is containing his laughter]  				",7,21,126
Michael, [looks at the clock to see it is three o’clock] Jim where is Pam?,7,21,126
Michael," But it is already three o’clock! [Michael leaves, Jim gives a knowing look to the camera]  				",7,21,126
Michael," [in his office talking to Creed, Gabe, and Meredith in that order] Whether you’re scared of dying, or dying Alone, or dying drunk in a ditch. Don’t be. It’s going to be okay.  				",7,21,126
Michael, Yeah I was tripling up. There’s not enough time in the day to have a special moment with everybody.  				,7,21,126
Michael," [Gabe is still standing in front of Michael’s desk] And you, why are you still here.",7,21,126
Michael,"  No, you are not going to quit today. For goodness sake, this is not going to be your last day in the office. Everybody gets dumped Gabe. Can I give you a piece of advice? [Gabe nods] A little cover-up on your Adam’s apple will make it appear smaller, and make you look less like a transvestite. [Gabe looks awkward and Michael winks]  				",7,21,126
Michael," [standing in front of his office, sees that it is three forty five] Okay, everybody come on. Conference room five seconds! Let’s go! Hurry up, let’s do this! [Dwight runs into the conference room. All others follow]  				",7,21,126
Michael," Okay, here we are in the conference room. Once again. And I just wanted to call you all here, together, because I have something important. Well there’s two things actually. Okay first, I would like a whereabouts on Pam. [Jim looks regretful] And secondly, Phyllis how are those mittens coming? Because I would actually like to bring them home and pack them. I’m leaving for the day at four.",7,21,126
Michael, [cutting her off] Well power through the arthritis Phyllis you can do it!,7,21,126
Michael," [the office looks up expectantly] Ummm… Hm… No. [changing his mind] No. There’s a special guest that I would like to invite to say one last goodbye. So here he comes, he’s coming right in. [walks out and then back in, now using a Vietnamese accent] Oh hi everybody, it’s Ping! [the office groans] And I’m here to say goodbye to all you wonderful people! Thank you everybody! You’ve been so wonderful! [only Kevin is laughing. Stanley tries to leave. Michael hugs him] I ruv you all! I ruv you very much!  ",7,21,126
Michael, Why am I so sad? Am I doing the wrong thing?,7,21,126
Michael," [pulls out a recorder and speaks softly into it] T-Shirt idea, goodbyes stink. Okay, alright. So. James Halpert. [starts to cry] You started with this company, as a fine young man…",7,21,126
Michael, [hears a taxi honking] Oh shoot! That’s my cab.,7,21,126
Michael," I know, it’s okay. Just, give her a hug. Alright?",7,21,126
Michael, I am looking forward to lunch. And hearing about what a great boss I am.,7,21,126
Michael, Okay… [crosses Jim off his list] Phyllis.,7,21,126
Michael," No no no, let me see. [picks up the mostly knitted mittens] Oh Phyllis, nice try. I love ’em. [waves goodbye to her with the mittens] [Michael begins walking out the office, he takes one last look at all his friends to see them working, and Jim looking back, teary eyed]",7,21,126
Michael," Got almost everybody. So… Holly’s my family now. [you see video of Michael getting into the cab, and driving off. As the cab leaves, Pam drives in] She’s my family. The babies that I make with her, will be my children. The people that you work with, are just… when you get down to it… your very best friends. They say, on your deathbed, you never wish you spent more time at the office. But I will. Gotta be a lot better than a deathbed. [You see Michael getting out and entering the airport, and going through security] I actually don’t understand deathbeds. I mean, who would buy that?  				",7,21,126
Michael," [putting his shoes back on, talking to the camera crew] Well, I guess this is it. Hey will you guys let me know if this ever airs? Thank you. Alright… Oh! [pulls out his mic from his shirt] This is gonna feel so good, getting this thing off my chest. [he hands them the body mic, when he speaks it is inaudible now] That’s what she said! [waves goodbye and walks off to his gate, halfway there Pam comes running up to him and they hug for a while. They say their goodbyes to each other, and Michael walks off for good]  				",7,21,126
Dwight, [singing] Shall I play for you? Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming] I have no gifts for you. Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming]  					,1,1,1
Dwight, Just clearing my desk. I can’t concentrate.,1,1,1
Dwight," It’s overlapping. It’s all spilling over the edge. One word, two syllables. Demarcation.",1,1,1
Dwight, Safety violation. I could fall and pierce an organ.,1,1,1
Dwight," Downsizing? I have no problem with that. I have been recommending downsizing since I first got here. I even brought it up in my interview. I say, bring it on.  					",1,1,1
Dwight, I’m Assistant Regional Manager. I should know first.,1,1,1
Dwight," OK, um, can you just tell me please? Just tell me quietly. Can you whisper it in my ear?",1,1,1
Dwight," Please, OK? Do you want me to tell ’em?",1,1,1
Dwight, OK. You tell ’em. With my permission. Permission granted.,1,1,1
Dwight," Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager.",1,1,1
Dwight," Uh… yeah I got a ’78 280Z. Bought it for $1,200. Fixed it up. It’s now worth three grand.",1,1,1
Dwight," New engine, new suspension, I got a respray. I’ve got some photos.  					",1,1,1
Dwight, That’s real professional thanks. That’s the third time and it wasn’t funny the first two times either Jim.  					,1,1,1
Dwight," It’s OK here, but people sometimes take advantage because it’s so relaxed. I’m a volunteer Sheriff’s Deputy on the weekends. And you cannot screw around there. That’s sort of one of the rules.  					",1,1,1
Dwight," OK you know what, you can be a witness. [points to Ryan] Can you reprimand him?",1,1,1
Dwight, It’s always you. Are you going to discipline him or not?,1,1,1
Dwight," OK, that’s great. I guess what I’m most concerned with is damage to company property. That’s all.",1,1,1
Dwight, Yes I do. I should have done it weeks ago actually.,1,2,2
Dwight," I’m sorry. It’s an orientation. It’s not a race. Plus a lot of other races are intolerant of gays, so…paradox.",1,2,2
Dwight," Excuse me, I’m sorry, but that’s not all it takes to be a hero.",1,2,2
Dwight," A hero kills people, people that wish him harm.",1,2,2
Dwight," A hero is part-human and part-supernatural. A hero is born out of a childhood trauma, or out of a disaster that must be avenged.",1,2,2
Dwight," Lots of cultures eat rice, doesn’t help me.",1,2,2
Dwight, Um… Shalom. I’d like to apply for a loan.,1,2,2
Dwight," OK, do me. Something stereotypical so I can get it really quick.",1,2,2
Dwight," Outback steakhouse. [Australian accent] I’m Australian, mate!",1,2,2
Dwight," OK, first, let’s go over some parameters. How many people can I fire?",1,3,3
Dwight," OK, we’ll table that for the time being. Two, I’ll need an office. I think the conference room should be fine.",1,3,3
Dwight," [to self] Yes, I have an office. [to camera] Bigger than his.",1,3,3
Dwight, What did I do? I did my job. I slashed benefits to the bone. I saved this company money. Was I too harsh? Maybe. I don’t believe in coddling people.,1,3,3
Dwight," In the wild, there is no health care. In the wild, health care is, “Ow, I hurt my leg. I can’t run. A lion eats me and I’m dead.” Well, I’m not dead. I’m the lion. You’re dead.  				",1,3,3
Dwight," Uh, knock, please. Please knock. This is an office.",1,3,3
Dwight," Just knock, Please? As a sign of respect for your superior.",1,3,3
Dwight," Aww, times are tough, Pam. Deal with it.",1,3,3
Dwight, Don’t need it. Never been sick. Perfect immune system.,1,3,3
Dwight," I don’t need them. Superior genes. I’m a Schrute. And superior brain power. Through concentration, I can raise and lower my cholesterol at will.",1,3,3
Dwight, It’s a great plan. It saves the company a fortune.,1,3,3
Dwight," OK, everyone. Gather round. Step forward. It has been brought to my attention that some of you are unhappy with my plan. So what I’d like you to do is to fill this out and write down any diseases you have that you might want covered and I’ll see what I can do.",1,3,3
Dwight," OK, well, I didn’t say to write your name down, did I? Fill it out, leave it anonymous. Or, don’t write any disease down at all and it won’t be covered. Sound fair? Good. I’ll be in my office.",1,3,3
Dwight," All right, who did this? I’m not mad. I just want to know who did it so I can punish them. ",1,3,3
Dwight," Uh, someone forged, uh, medical information and that is a felony.",1,3,3
Dwight," Uh, leprosy? Flesh eating bacteria. Hot-dog fingers. Government-created killer nanorobot infection.",1,3,3
Dwight," I know it was you. Fine. You know what? I’ll have to interview each and every one of you until the perpetrator makes him or herself known. And until that time, there will be no health care coverage for any one!  				",1,3,3
Dwight," The problem, Jim, is that people who are really suffering from a medical condition won’t receive the care they need, because someone in this office is coming up with all this ridiculous stuff. [reads off of paper] “Count Choculitis”",1,3,3
Dwight, Why did you write that down Jim? Is it because you know I love Count Chocula?,1,3,3
Dwight," Jim! Damnit! No! Jim! Let me out! Jim! Let… [Without looking, Jim throws his keys to his left, they land on a shelf next to Stanley]",1,3,3
Dwight, Yes I can. I’m manager for the day. Clean out your desk.,1,3,3
Dwight," Uh, hello. Uh, this is Dwight Schrute calling for Jan Levenson-Gould.",1,3,3
Dwight," Hi. Dwight Schrute calling, acting manager, Scranton branch. Listen, I needed your permission to fire Jim Halpert.",1,3,3
Dwight, He is not here right now. He put me in charge of the office.,1,3,3
Dwight," That’s not entirely true, because he put me in charge of picking the health care plan.",1,3,3
Dwight," Call you immediately. Good. Oh, hey, listen, um, since I have you on the phone, um, can I fire Jim?",1,3,3
Dwight," Oh, this is your cell, I thought this was your… [dial tone]  				",1,3,3
Dwight," I tried being rational, OK? And what happened? The employees went crazy, I got no help from corporate. That leaves me with no options.  				",1,3,3
Dwight," I’m now going to read out loud your submitted medical conditions. When you hear yours read, please raise your hand to indicate that it is real. If you do not raise your hand, it will not be covered.",1,3,3
Dwight," You know what? You have forfeited that privilege. I have tried to treat you all as adults, but obviously I am the only adult here. Number one, inverted penis.",1,3,3
Dwight, I thought your vagina was removed during your hysterectomy?,1,3,3
Dwight," OK, great. Dermatitis. Thank you Angela. I’ll make sure that’s covered. OK, now. Who wrote this, hysterical one? Anal fissures?",1,3,3
Dwight," Oh, um… Jan wants you to call her.  				",1,3,3
Dwight, I wanted to talk to you about the downsizing?,1,4,4
Dwight," I, but if there were, I’d be protected as assistant regional manager?",1,4,4
Dwight," It’s a real shame, ’cause studies have shown that more information gets passed through water-cooler gossip than through official memos. Which puts me at a disadvantage, because I bring my own water to work.  				",1,4,4
Dwight," I didn’t do it. What do you mean? Oh, the water cooler was brought over here for… maintenance. So what do you guys hear? What’s the scuttlebutt?  				",1,4,4
Dwight," Hey, so listen, I was thinking that it might be a good idea if you and I formed an alliance. ‘Cause of the downsizing? I think an alliance might be a good idea, you know. Help each other out.",1,4,4
Dwight," Do you want to form, an alliance, with me?",1,4,4
Dwight," Good, good. Excellent, OK. Now we need to figure out who’s vulnerable and who’s protected…  				",1,4,4
Dwight, The gun show. [Rolls up his sleeve and kisses his bicep]  				,1,4,4
Dwight, There’s one other thing and this is important. Let’s keep this alliance totally a secret. Don’t tell anyone.  				,1,4,4
Dwight," Jim! Hey. Hi, Pam. Listen, could I talk to you a second about the… paper products?  				",1,4,4
Dwight," They seem awfully chummy, don’t you think?",1,4,4
Dwight," I could tell, from the body language.  				",1,4,4
Dwight," Name, Meredith Palmer. Uh, personal information, divorced twice, two kids. Uh, Employer, Dunder Mifflin Paper Incorporated. Awards, multiple Dundies.",1,4,4
Dwight," No no, yes there is. Behind the shelves. Oh my God.",1,4,4
Dwight," I’m a deer hunter. I go all the time with my dad. One thing about deer, they have very good vision. One thing about me, I am better at hiding than they are… at vision.  				",1,4,4
Dwight," This is going to be perfect, OK? Centrally located. Perfect cover. I can hear and see everything.",1,4,4
Dwight," Look, I can breathe just fine. OK, but if it makes you feel better, I’ll poke holes in the box.",1,4,4
Dwight," No, you need to go upstairs to the party so people don’t notice we’re both gone.",1,4,4
Dwight," Can I trust Jim? I don’t know. Do I have a choice? No, frankly, I don’t. Will I trust Jim? Yes. Should I trust Jim? You tell me.  				",1,4,4
Dwight," Do I feel bad about betraying Jim? Not at all. That’s the game. Convince him we’re in an alliance, get some information, throw him to the wolves.",1,4,4
Dwight," [With blonde hair] That’s politics baby. Get what you can out of someone, then crush them. I think Jim might have learned a very valuable lesson.  				",1,4,4
Dwight," Michael, can I talk to you, please? Privately? In your office? I think I should be on the team.",1,5,5
Dwight, And that’s why you have an assistant regional manager.,1,5,5
Dwight," So we need someone to work this Saturday and I think that, that should be…Jim.",1,5,5
Dwight," Michael, look. [Dwight throws paper at the garbage can]",1,5,5
Dwight," OK, we’ll see who’s working this weekend then.",1,5,5
Dwight," [taking off his shirt] OK, we’ll be skins!",1,5,5
Dwight," De-fense! [clap, clap] [Michael joins in] De-fense! [clap clap]",1,5,5
Dwight, [scores] Yeah! [points to Madge] In your face!,1,5,5
Dwight," Here, give me that. You have to break the interior bag. [bag explodes]",1,5,5
Dwight," The purse girl hits everything on my checklist. Creamy skin. Straight teeth. Curly hair. Amazing breasts. Not for me, for my children. The Schrutes produce very thirsty babies.   				",1,6,6
Dwight, Hmmm… she’s been talking to Michael a lot. ,1,6,6
Dwight, True. Plus I can talk to her about the origins of my last name. ,1,6,6
Dwight, I don’t want a purse. Purses are for girls. ,1,6,6
Dwight," Okay, I’m just going to use the bathroom, and then I’m going… ",1,6,6
Dwight, Michael could I ask you something? I wanted to ask your permission to ask out Katy. I know it’s against the rules and everything. Because…,1,6,6
Dwight," Thank you, Michael. I appreciate this so much.  ",1,6,6
Dwight, Is that all it is? Just a ride home? Like a taxicab? ,1,6,6
Dwight," Please. Please, I am your inferior and I’m asking you this favor. Can you promise me that it will just be a ride home? ",1,6,6
Dwight," You cannot promise me, or you won’t promise me?  ",1,6,6
Dwight," Hey, how’s it going?  Good. Can I talk to you for a second? In private? ",1,6,6
Dwight, Please? I wanted to talk to you in private because I wanted to ask you out on a date. ,1,6,6
Dwight," Ok was that no to talking to me in private, or was that no to the date? ",1,6,6
Dwight, Mine are at home in a display case above my bed.,2,1,8
Dwight," So, what’s the joke? You’re not perfect either.",2,1,8
Dwight," That is defacement of company property. So you better tell me. Kelly, if you tell me, you’ll be punished less.",2,1,8
Dwight," …no, no, no, no, it’s not what you think.",2,1,8
Dwight," Excuse me, everyone, could I have your attention please. I just wanted to say that the women in this office are terrible. Especially the ones who wrote that stuff about Michael on the bathroom wall. Having a bathroom is a privilege. It is called a ladies room for a reason. And if you cannot behave like ladies, well then you are not going to have a bathroom.  					",2,1,8
Dwight, Be prepared to hold folks [Michael comes out of his office] From 9 am to…,2,1,8
Dwight," Nnnnno, there needs to be repercussions…",2,1,8
Dwight, Welcome to the eighth annual Dundies awards.,2,1,8
Dwight," Before we get started, a few announcements. Keep your acceptance speeches short, I have wrap it up music, and I’m not afraid to use it. [points] Devon!  					",2,1,8
Dwight, Really? We don’t have any girls from HR.,2,1,8
Dwight," Quick, quick, the woman is having a seizure. Grab her tongue, grab her tongue! It’s okay, I’m a sheriff’s deputy.",2,1,8
Dwight, Don’t get into that now. We need something to cushion her head. Throw pillow? A cush-,2,1,8
Dwight," Thanks, I had to, uh, check her pupils to make sure there wasn’t a concussion.",2,1,8
Dwight, So the monkey does the sex thing right here! [monkey noises in background] ,2,2,9
Dwight, Do you want the link because then you could forward it around?,2,2,9
Dwight, You said that we could come to you if we had any questions.,2,2,9
Dwight," Where is the clitoris? On a website, it said at the crest of the labia. What does that mean? What does the female vagina look like?   				",2,2,9
Dwight," And it worked. They should bring the stocks back. People’d obey the law, there’d be less troublemakers.",2,3,10
Dwight, I’m good. I can make sure things are up to code.,2,3,10
Dwight," Please, I’m always the guy you rely on at work. ",2,3,10
Dwight," I have been Michael’s #2 guy for about 5 years. And we make a great team. We’re like one of those classic famous teams. He’s like Mozart, and I’m like Mozart’s friend. No. I’m like Butch Cassidy, and Michael is like Mozart. You try and hurt Mozart; you’re going to get a bullet in your head courtesy of Butch Cassidy.   					",2,3,10
Dwight, What kind of shocks you got on this baby?,2,3,10
Dwight, [tries to open sun roof] I want to put the top down. ,2,3,10
Dwight, Check it out. [points at sunglasses] Terminator.,2,3,10
Dwight," Actually, I do own property. My grandfather left me a 60 acre working beet farm. I run it with my cousin, Mose. We sell beets to local stores and restaurants. It’s a nice little farm. Sometimes teenagers use it for sex.   					",2,3,10
Dwight," Actually, no. We have a couple of questions, about the neighborhood. ",2,3,10
Dwight, Let’s go check out the master bedroom.   					,2,3,10
Dwight," No, no, no, no, no. This is a shared wall. Neighbor throws his wife into the wall, plasma screen hits the floor. Totally smashed. ",2,3,10
Dwight," Warrantees don’t cover it, plus they’re a rip-off. ",2,3,10
Dwight, Listen. [puts ear to wall] Can you hear that? Oh man. These babies are thin.   					,2,3,10
Dwight," Wow, you’ll be paying this off in your mid-seventies.",2,3,10
Dwight," Forget about retiring when you’re 65. Hey, I’ve got an idea. You know that extra bedroom? If the whole girlfriend thing never happens, that’s where the nurse can live. ",2,3,10
Dwight," A thirty year mortgage at Michael’s age essentially means that he’s buying a coffin. If I were buying my coffin, I would get one with thicker walls so you couldn’t hear the other dead people.   					",2,3,10
Dwight, Totally having fun. Can you imagine those poor saps stuck at the office today? [laughs]  					,2,3,10
Dwight, Question. Where can I put my terrarium?,2,3,10
Dwight, It’s a fish tank for snakes and lizards. ,2,3,10
Dwight, Question. My grandparents left me a large number of armoires.   					,2,3,10
Dwight," Question. What about carpooling, who pays for the gas?",2,3,10
Dwight, Question. Can sometimes I drive your car and you drive mine?,2,3,10
Dwight, Question. Who is the primary on the fire insurance?,2,3,10
Dwight," Thank god. It was nice of him to offer, but I live in a nine bedroom farm house. I have my own crossbow range. It’s a perfect situation for me. Although two bathrooms would have been nice, we just have the one. And it’s under the porch.   					",2,3,10
Dwight, You know you can always refinance your mortgage. We had a 15 year on our beet farm.  We paid it off early.,2,3,10
Dwight, Michael’s in there right now evaluating the temp. He hasn’t evaluated me in years.   				,2,4,11
Dwight," Michael and I have a very special connection. He’s like Batman, I’m like Robin. He’s like the Lone Ranger, and I’m like Tonto. And it’s not like there was the Lone Ranger, and Tonto, and Bonto.   				",2,4,11
Dwight," Please, move quickly! This is a paper company, people! Step lively! ",2,4,11
Dwight," This whole place is a tinder box, it is ready to blow!   				",2,4,11
Dwight, STANLEY! Have you ever seen a burn victim? ,2,4,11
Dwight," We’ve got smoke! We’ve got smoke! Smoke! Gah! [Spots Kelly] Oh, Kelly! You’re okay! I’ve got you!",2,4,11
Dwight, Cover your nose and mouth. Breathe through your nose. ,2,4,11
Dwight," Breathe through your nose. Remove your stockings. Okay? They’ll melt right into your flesh! Stay below the smoke line. Let’s go! Clear out, stat! STAT MEANS NOW!   				",2,4,11
Dwight," Okay, guys, listen up, we need a head count. We need to count off. Michael’s number one. Where is he? Where is he?   				",2,4,11
Dwight," Hey, Michael. Um… Ryan needs his number for the count off. ",2,4,11
Dwight," Okay, he can have 14. Marjory’s not here today. ",2,4,11
Dwight," Oh, you know what else? I thought of a nickname for the three of us. Three Musketeers. ",2,4,11
Dwight," That’s funny, too. But if we’re the Three Musketeers…   				",2,4,11
Dwight," [to firemen] Hey guys, great response time. Listen up, I got some theories. Okay, there’s a…   				",2,4,11
Dwight," Okay. Great, that’s going to keep you warm for like 7 seconds. Question:",2,4,11
Dwight," Yeah, but look, I mean, he didn’t need business school. Okay, Michael comes from the school of hard knocks. ",2,4,11
Dwight, Self taught. You didn’t even go to college. ,2,4,11
Dwight," [scoffs] Come on. I’m studying with the master, huh?  ",2,4,11
Dwight," [to Ryan] You should learn from him, right? ",2,4,11
Dwight," Yeah, it’s all him and Michael talk about anymore. ",2,4,11
Dwight," Oh yeah, Pam. Right. That’s going to help things, just talk it out. I hope the war goes on forever and Ryan gets drafted. ",2,4,11
Dwight," I’m sorry I said that, I didn’t… just part of me meant it. Besides, he’d end up being a hero anyway.  ",2,4,11
Dwight," Oh Jim, I’m not going to quit. Then Ryan wins. ",2,4,11
Dwight, Thanks you guys. I just need some alone time. ,2,4,11
Dwight," If you had your cell phone, it would make you happy? ",2,4,11
Dwight," [coughing] Everyone, okay? Uh, I have an announcement. Apparently, in business school, they don’t teach you how to operate a toaster oven. Because some smart, sexy temp left his cheese pita on oven instead of timing it for the toaster thing. ",2,4,11
Dwight," I have a song. Attention, everyone! That I want to sing. That I wrote especially for this occasion when I was up there among the flames. Ready? [sings to Billy Joel’s “We Didn’t Start the Fire”] Ryan started the fire! It was always burning since the world’s been turning! ",2,4,11
Dwight, Eat it! You gotta eat it. You have to eat it!  				,2,4,11
Dwight, Was it worth it? Was it worth it temp? ,2,4,11
Dwight," [sings] Joe McCarthy, Richard Nixon, Studebaker, television, North Korea, South Korea, Marilyn Monroe, Ryan started the fire!   				",2,4,11
Dwight, [eyeing Jim’s costume] What is that?! What are you supposed to be?,2,5,12
Dwight," Yeah, well look… [pulls his hood over his head and pops up his light saber] What about me?",2,5,12
Dwight, I am a Sith Lord. [looks at Jim] Oh big deal. Three round pieces of paper taped to a shirt. This cost me 129 dollars.,2,5,12
Dwight," Wait, what are you again? Oh, right… Three-hole PUNCH! [punches Jim in the chest and cracks up laughing]  				",2,5,12
Dwight, Stanley. Pam. Oscar. Meredith. Kevin. Angela.  				,2,5,12
Dwight," Stanley, could you come with me, please.",2,5,12
Dwight," Look! I’ve got some bad news. You’re fired. You need to pack up your things and go. [Stanley laughs.] I’m serious, Stanley. It’s over.  I’m sorry.",2,5,12
Dwight," If you want to fire him, you’re going to have to tell him yourself.",2,5,12
Dwight," [whispering on the phone] Cumberland Mills?! And how did you get my resume? Oh no, no. I’m very flattered. Don’t get me wrong. I’m just not sure that it’s my official resume or if it’s something that maybe a satisfied customer posted online. What does it say under martial arts training? Oh. Okay, I’m gonna have to supplement that. Could I have your fax number?   				",2,5,12
Dwight," Would I ever leave this company? Look, I’m all about loyalty. In fact, I feel like part of what I’m getting paid for here is my loyalty. But, if there were somewhere else that valued that loyalty more highly, I’m going wherever they value loyalty the most.   				",2,5,12
Dwight," [on the phone] So you got the fax? So why didn’t you add it to the res… ? What do you mean? Of course martial arts training is relevant. Oh, excuse me! I know about a billion Asians that would beg to differ. Uh, yeah, I get a little frustrated when I’m dealing with incompetence. Well, you know what? You can go to hell, too. And I will see you there… burning. Fine! Okay… oh wait! So you’ll let me know when you’ve made a decis… [stops and hangs up phone.]  				",2,5,12
Dwight," This is called leveraging an offer. [walks into Michael’s office] Michael, can I talk to you for a moment?",2,5,12
Dwight," I just thought you should know that I was just offered a job with better pay, better benefits and a better title at Cumberland Mills.",2,5,12
Dwight, … so I was hoping to be made Assistant Regional Manager officially.,2,5,12
Dwight, I can’t. I… I suppose I coul… no. They never really made me an offer anyway.,2,5,12
Dwight, This is not funny.  This is totally unprofessional. ,2,6,13
Dwight," Ok, I am going to tell Michael and this entire office will be punished!",2,6,13
Dwight," [In bathroom, answers phone] Dwight Schrute.",2,6,13
Dwight," Jim, I’ve given you this information, like, twenty times.",2,6,13
Dwight," [Also on the phone] Sensei, hello it’s Sempai… ",2,6,13
Dwight," Yes, I just had a ques-… Yes Sensei. Arigatou gozaimashita. Hai.",2,6,13
Dwight," I am now Sempai, which is Assistant Sensei.",2,6,13
Dwight," I am a practitioner of Goju Ru Karate, here in Scranton. My Sensei, Ira, recently promoted me to purple belt, and gave me the duties of a Sempai. Not that a lot of people here in America know what a Sempai is, but it is equally as respected as a Sensei.  					",2,6,13
Dwight, Impossible. The way they’re programmed… You’re mocking me.,2,6,13
Dwight," Look, I’m going to offer you a little piece of advice. I’m not afraid to make an example out of you.",2,6,13
Dwight, Arigatou. This is not a toy. This is a message to the entire office so they can see that I am capable of physically dominating them.   					,2,6,13
Dwight," No women or children, unless provoked. ",2,6,13
Dwight," Michael, I told you, it was because it was New Year’s Eve and it began to snow at exactly midnight. ",2,6,13
Dwight," Did I want to harm Michael? The one man I’ve been hired to protect? No, I did not.   					",2,6,13
Dwight, I come from a long line of fighters. My maternal grandfather was the toughest guy I ever knew. World War II veteran. Killed 20 men then spent the rest of the war in an Allied Prison Camp. My father battled blood pressure and obesity all his life. Different kind of fight.   					,2,6,13
Dwight," [to Kevin, who he is teaching to fight] Take this pen and stab me with it. ",2,6,13
Dwight," Now watch, let me take you from behind.",2,6,13
Dwight," In case you remember, I was defending my honor… like a samurai.",2,6,13
Dwight," Ok, fine. Tit for tit. Give it your best shot. Two punches. Go!",2,6,13
Dwight," No, I would block your first punch rendering it ineffective.",2,6,13
Dwight," No, it’s free during the day. It’s fine.",2,6,13
Dwight, I need to change my emergency contact information from Michael Scott.,2,6,13
Dwight, Just put “The Hospital.” Contact number:,2,6,13
Dwight, I can handle it. I can. Wow. So I guess this will just be my office.,2,6,13
Dwight," Michael, I have so much to learn from you.",2,6,13
Dwight, You took something that doesn’t belong to you.,2,7,14
Dwight," Not in a thousand years, Catherine.  We work together.  And get off my desk!  ",2,7,14
Dwight," Yes, I have acted before.  I was in a production of “Oklahoma” in the seventh grade.  I played the part of Mutey the Mailman.  They had too many kids, so they made up roles like that.  I was good.  ",2,7,14
Dwight," If it isn’t my old partner, Samuel L. Chang.",2,7,14
Dwight, Thank you for noticing.  Now keep me company for one more mission. [Pam gets up to talk to Roy],2,7,14
Dwight," Yes, perhaps I would, Goldenface.  Sam, get my luggage.",2,7,14
Dwight," Samuel, you are such an idiot, you are the worst assistant ever.  And you’re disgusting, Dwigt. [out of character] Wait, who’s Dwigt?  ",2,7,14
Dwight," Ok, you know what? I am done with this.  That’s it, the end.  ",2,7,14
Dwight," Uh, you don’t speak for everyone, Jim. Ok, announcement.  My uncle bought me some fireworks.  Anyone who wants to see a real show, come with me outside now.",2,7,14
Dwight, [waking up on office couch] Michael?  Michael? [goes into Michael’s office]  Michael?  [looks out Michael’s window] His car’s not in the parking lot.  I should check the accident reports. [taxi pulls into Dunder-Mifflin parking lot] Who’s this?  Jan?  ,2,7,14
Dwight, Do you even know what this is?  It is a fitness orb and it has completely changed my life.  Forget everything you thought you knew about ab workouts.,2,8,15
Dwight, This ab workout is specifically designed to strengthen your core. [knocks things around Jim’s desk] Sorry.,2,8,15
Dwight," Numerous health benefits, strengthens your back, better performance in sports, more enjoyable sex.",2,8,15
Dwight," Plus, improves your reflexes [knocks over more stuff] see, I would have caught that.",2,8,15
Dwight," Oh, hey, listen, Jim.  Here’s a little tip for your performance review.",2,8,15
Dwight, Tell Michael that we should be stocking more of the double-tabbed manila file folders.,2,8,15
Dwight," Yeah, it’s a new product.  So, you should just suggest that to him and he’ll be sure to give you a raise.",2,8,15
Dwight," Uh, that is so stupid.  What if he gives it to you?",2,8,15
Dwight," Ugh, you know what?  I am going to zone you out for the rest of today.  I need to stay focused, and I don’t have to see you tomorrow or Sunday and please don’t call me, and we’ll see how things go on Monday.  Uh, stupid.",2,8,15
Dwight," No, I went out and got drunk with my laser tag team last night.  Crap!  I never go out on a Thursday night; what the hell was I thinking?  				",2,8,15
Dwight, You need to do something about your B.O.,2,8,15
Dwight," Yeah, who wants to come in on a Saturday?",2,8,15
Dwight, “Don’t sleep with your boss”? Do you think this is referring to you boning Jan?  				,2,8,15
Dwight, [loud metal music playing in a stairwell; Dwight pacing] You are giving me this raise!  I deserve this raise! [plays air guitar] Yes! [kicks] Yes! Yes! Hiya!  The least you can do is keep my salary consistent with inflation! Keeya eyah!  Yes!  Why are you gonna give me this raise?  Why?  Because… I’m awesome! I am awesome!  				,2,8,15
Dwight," I’m sorry, am I interrupting?  Oh God; were you guys making out?",2,8,15
Dwight," Uh, wait, I would like to discuss my raise?",2,8,15
Dwight, That is an excellent question. Thank you for asking.  Let me bring up one word:,2,8,15
Dwight, I’d also further like to talk about my merits in the workplace.,2,8,15
Dwight," For instance, the time I brought in deer jerky for the whole office. ",2,8,15
Dwight," It’s a delicacy.  And you know what?  It’s an aphrodisiac.  So when we’re done here, you guys could go over to The Antler Lodge, sample some deer and talk about my raise.",2,8,15
Dwight," And in conclusion, I think that Lex Luthor said it best when he said “Dad, you have no idea what I’m capable of”.  ",2,8,15
Dwight," Smallville.  And that is why, I feel, that I deserve this raise.  				",2,8,15
Dwight, [running through parking lot] I’m here! I’m here! I’m here! It’s ok!  				,2,8,15
Dwight," Ok, I’m sorry.  What is going on in there? Why is he here?  What are you doing?",2,9,16
Dwight," Look, Michael, I know you don’t want to have to think about this, but if something were to happen to you, God forbid, then I would need to know in order to take over.",2,9,16
Dwight," Yeah, but that doesn’t matter, you could get a brain aneurysm-",2,9,16
Dwight," Or a bus or a train. Get poisoned, fall in a well, step on a mine, choke.",2,9,16
Dwight, So it’s true?  You have access to our e-mails?,2,9,16
Dwight," Oh hey, just so ya know, if you have a lot of sensitive e-mails, they need to be deleted immediately.",2,9,16
Dwight, Does he have access to their medical records?,2,9,16
Dwight," I think one of the greatest things about modern America is the computerization of medical records.  As a volunteer sheriff, I can look up anyone’s psychiatric records or surgical histories.  Yeast infections.  There are a huge number of yeast infections in this county.  Probably because we are down river from that old bread factory.  				",2,9,16
Dwight," Unfortunately, I’ve got plans. I have to go to practice.  Soccer practice.  ",2,9,16
Dwight," Have fun tonight!  Whatever it is that you’re doing, and I’ll see you Monday. [to the camera]  He has no idea!  				",2,9,16
Dwight," Jim!  You really think this is a good idea, huh? A hide-a-key rock? ",2,9,16
Dwight," Thanks.  Yeah, I always keep an extra set in the car, for special occasions.  Jim, come here.",2,9,16
Dwight, I’ve got it leveraged. Push. Straight up.,2,10,17
Dwight," One, two, three. [they push the tree up and it breaks through a ceiling tile.]",2,10,17
Dwight," [now wearing an elf hat and ears] Okay, everybody listen up! It is time to get your presents, wrap them, and place them under the tree like so. If you do not get your present wrapped and under the tree within the next five minutes you will be disqualified from Secret Santa. All right? No exceptions except Michael.  				",2,10,17
Dwight," Gather round. Secret Santa, let’s go. Let’s go. Come on. Stanley, no, I’m going to handle the cord. Okay, safety reasons.",2,10,17
Dwight," Hey, I could get some flares from my car.",2,10,17
Dwight, Okay. Okay. That’s enough. Let’s keep it moving on. Jim.,2,10,17
Dwight," All right, next. Ryan. [tosses present]",2,10,17
Dwight, We don’t do anything until Michael gives us further instructions.,2,10,17
Dwight," Yes, now you can steal the oven mitt, the old shirt or the shower radio or pick a new gift.",2,10,17
Dwight," Okay, moving along. Meredith, let’s go.",2,10,17
Dwight, It’s already been stolen this round. Pick something else.,2,10,17
Dwight, I never said it was better than an iPod.  				,2,10,17
Dwight," Michael keeps bragging about his iPod, but you know what? Two paintball lessons with someone as experienced as I am is worth easily, like, 2 grand.  				",2,10,17
Dwight," [shooting paintball gun at target] Take that, Saddam!  				",2,10,17
Dwight," Pam, steal something or pick the final gift.",2,10,17
Dwight, Yes! There you go. I want the teapot. Gracias.,2,10,17
Dwight, Yankee Swap is like Machiavelli meets … Christmas.  				,2,10,17
Dwight, “A real man makes his own luck.” Billy Zane. ,2,10,17
Dwight," True. But I get sinus infections, and sinus infections can be cured by making your tea from green tea leaf stems .. ",2,10,17
Dwight," .. and pouring it directly into your nose, like so. [demonstrates]  				",2,10,17
Dwight," Oh, hello there. [Kelly leans up and kisses him] But what are you doing?",2,10,17
Dwight, You shouldn’t do things like that. The man is supposed to do that.  				,2,10,17
Dwight, This is not funny. Why is my stuff in here?,2,11,18
Dwight," Yeah, well, I’m not paying for my own stuff, okay? I know you did this, because you’re friends with the vending machine guy.",2,11,18
Dwight," No, no, no, no, no. That’s my pencil cup.",2,11,18
Dwight," Uh, I think so, and you’re going to hand it over to me.",2,11,18
Dwight," [putting quarters in] Five, ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five…   				",2,11,18
Dwight," I was the youngest pilot in Pan Am history. When I was four, the pilot let me ride in the cockpit and fly the plane with him. And I was four. And I was great. And I would have landed it, but my dad wanted us to go back to our seats.  				",2,11,18
Dwight, [singing] What do you do with a drunken sailor? What do you do with a drunken sailor? What do you do with a drunken sailor early in the morning?,2,11,18
Dwight," I can’t. Do you want us to run aground, woman?!  				",2,11,18
Dwight, Wow. You should be the motivational speaker.,2,11,18
Dwight," Yeah. He gives me real responsibility, Michael. Captain Jack delegates. He’s let me steer the ship for the last hour.  				",2,11,18
Dwight, Seasick? Captain Jack says you should look at the Moon.,2,11,18
Dwight," Don’t worry, Michael. I’m taking us to shore.",2,11,18
Dwight," [silence, Dwight enters the office] What is going on? What is going on?",2,12,19
Dwight, Hold on Michael! I am coming! Wait there!,2,12,19
Dwight," Hey, Pam, I’m assistant regional manager, and I can take care of him. Part of my duties are to.",2,12,19
Dwight," Yeah, they’re like an i-Pod only they’re better ’cause they’re chunkier and more solid.",2,12,19
Dwight," Oh, no no no.  Don’t go there.  I know this Russian website where you can download songs for two cents a piece.",2,12,19
Dwight," Yeah, I’ll write down the address for you.  Only, the only thing is, is that all the songs are in Russian. … Kidding!",2,12,19
Dwight," Why would they all be…?  Ok, see you later, Pan.",2,12,19
Dwight, These covers are totally indestructible. ,2,12,19
Dwight, Yeah. Throw it.  I promise it won’t break.  Chuck it. [Pam throws her mp3 player],2,12,19
Dwight," No, it’s fine.  I told you it wouldn’t break.  You could throw it all day long.",2,12,19
Dwight," [hits his head on his desk]  Uh, ugh, ohhhh… ",2,12,19
Dwight, Tired… [Jim grabs spray bottle from planter],2,12,19
Dwight," Aw, Pam, you’re adorable [taps her nose]",2,12,19
Dwight," You can’t fire me, I don’t work in this van!",2,12,19
Dwight," Meredith, men’s room. Make sure you replace the urinal cakes.  They’re worn down. Kevin file drawers. Angela kitchen. Oscar dusting. Where is Oscar?",2,13,20
Dwight, Which is exactly how you’d wanna sound like if you wanted someone to think you were sick.,2,13,20
Dwight, Listen Temp. I am conducting a little investigation so I’m no longer going to be able to head up spring cleaning.  Do you think you can handle it?,2,13,20
Dwight," Hey Oscar how ya doin’? Dwight Schrute calling.  Listen a little question for you, buddy.  I called six minutes ago and no one answered. So I was wondering if you could explain. Oh, I see, so. Sounds like you’re too sick to come into work but your well enough to go to the pharmacy.  				",2,13,20
Dwight," There are several different ways to tell if a perp is lying. The liar will avoid direct eye contact. The liar will cover part of his or her face with his hands, especially the mouth.  The liar will perspire.  Unfortunately I spoke to Oscar on the phone so none of this is useful.  				",2,13,20
Dwight," Oh, really nothing? Fact: You are drinking grape soda. You never drink grape soda.  Fact: You are talking to Jim. You never talk to Jim.",2,13,20
Dwight, Thank you Michael.  I know your telling the truth.,2,13,20
Dwight," So, how did Oscar sound when he called in?",2,13,20
Dwight," Ok, good, thank you.  That wasn’t so hard now was it?",2,13,20
Dwight, Quick Oscar update. I have conducted interviews with everyone in the office.,2,13,20
Dwight," As a volunteer Sheriff’s Deputy I have been doing surveillance for years.  One time I suspected an ex-girlfriend of mine of cheating on me.  So I tailed her for six straight nights.  Turns out she was, with a couple of guys actually so… mystery solved.  				",2,13,20
Dwight," Stay low… This is it… There he is. He’s been gone for at least two hours. Who is that? Come to Papa… Oh yes. Let’s roll. I knew it! You are so busted. Ice skates, shopping bags? I think I know what’s going on here. You weren’t sick at all.",2,13,20
Dwight, How bout this. I don’t tell Michael and in exchange you owe me one great big giant favor.  Redeemable by me at a time and place of my choosing.  				,2,13,20
Dwight," Guess what I found out about Oscar tonight? He was lying about being sick. Should I have reported Oscar’s malfeasance. Hmm, probably, but now I know something he doesn’t want me to know. So I can use his malfeasance to establish leverage.  Otherwise, it’s just malfeasance for malfeasanceses-ses sake.  				",2,13,20
Dwight, [putting his feet on desk] Ha ha ha… the old bullpen.,2,14,21
Dwight, That guy Miles who quit to form his own company?,2,14,21
Dwight, Should we help ’em pick up their stuff?,2,14,21
Dwight," [on phone] Hello, am I the 107th caller? [hangs up, dials again] Hello, Rock 107.  Am I the 107th caller? [hangs up and dials again] Hell , Rock 107.  Am I the 107th caller? [hangs up and begins to dial again] I’m totally gonna win us that box set.",2,14,21
Dwight," [on phone, whispering] Am I the 107th caller?  					",2,14,21
Dwight, Michael is gonna wipe the floor with us!  					,2,14,21
Dwight, Them in there all together. If they stay in there too long they’re going to get on the same cycle. Wreak havoc on our plumbing.  				,2,15,22
Dwight, Remember on Lost when they met the Others?  				,2,15,22
Dwight, Michael wants us to bond so we need topics for conversation.,2,15,22
Dwight, Yeah and then they make you drive them to Church the next morning. Like “Gas ain’t free!”,2,15,22
Dwight, I will stay here and run things on this end.,2,16,23
Dwight, Question. Will you be seeing Jan when you’re in New York?,2,16,23
Dwight," Well… It’s Valentine’s Day, and you guys, you know… ",2,16,23
Dwight," Yeah, but who put it here? And for what purpose?",2,16,23
Dwight, [opens box and reads card] Happy Valentine’s Day. [pulls out bobble head] It’s me. I’m the bobble head. Yes! [Angela smirks in background] Ahh!  				,2,16,23
Dwight," Hello Angela. Did you hear, somebody rocked the house and got me the best present I’ve ever gotten.",2,16,23
Dwight," Oh, I bet you will before the day is over. ",2,16,23
Dwight," Pam. Hi, How ya doing? Good. Listen, uh may I speak with you… privately? ",2,16,23
Dwight," No, Pam, Just. Just, [tilts head away, towards another room]  				",2,16,23
Dwight," [same time as Pam] Girlfriend. Yes, and the reason I didn’t get anything for this particular person – who shall remain nameless – is that she’s not really the kind of person you’d think would be into Valentine’s Day. She’s kind of… ",2,16,23
Dwight," Ok, shut up. I know exactly what to do. [gets up and leaves]  				",2,16,23
Dwight," Women are like wolves. If you want a wolf, you have to trap it. You have to snare it. And then you have to tame it. Keep it happy. Care for it. Feed it. Lovingly, the way an animal deserves to be loved. And my animal deserves a lot of loving.  				",2,16,23
Dwight," Ooh. They’re having a sale on TiVo. Maybe I should get a TiVo. Oh. DVD Burner! Maybe I should get one of those. You are so lucky, Jim. You are so lucky you don’t have this problem. What was the 9th place prize again? A loaf of bread? ",2,17,24
Dwight," Oh, great. Tasty, terrific pizza. Hmm. Question: Do their pizzas play DVDs?  					",2,17,24
Dwight," Well, it’s not really a big speech. You still coming right?",2,17,24
Dwight," What if I give a really long, extended Thank You. For instance, “Thank you, Mr. Blank. Thank you very, very, very…” ",2,17,24
Dwight," When I was in the sixth grade, I was a finalist in our school Spelling Bee. It was me against Raj Patel. And I misspelled, in front of the entire school, the word ‘failure’.   					",2,17,24
Dwight," Okay, deal! I’ll do whatever you say. No questions asked.",2,17,24
Dwight, Is that an insult or is that part of the public speaking advice?,2,17,24
Dwight, Hey. Do you remember the speeches that you gave?,2,17,24
Dwight, Excuse me! May I have your attention please? There has been an accident on 84 West. Cars have skidded off the road into the safety railing. Several cars have flipped. There is broken glass everywhere. Several people are injured.,2,17,24
Dwight, Brad Pitt. Also there will be no bonuses.,2,17,24
Dwight," He will never act again. Also, this branch is closing.",2,17,24
Dwight," Good morning, Vietnam! [general groaning] Okay. You know what? This isn’t working. Because um I’m not nervous in front of them. They’re my subordinates.",2,17,24
Dwight," Uh, yes you are. I’m Assistant Regional Manager.",2,17,24
Dwight, I can travel anywhere except Cuba. And I will travel to New Zealand. And walk the ‘Lord of the Rings’ trail to Mordor. And then I will hike Mount Doom. So… no… just leave me alone.,2,17,24
Dwight," [bangs fists] Blood alone moves the wheels of history! Have you ever asked yourselves in an hour of meditation, which everyone finds during the day. [waves arm] how long we have been striving for greatness? [bangs fist] Not only the years we’ve been at war, the war of work, but from the moment as a child when we realized that the world could be conquered. It has been a lifetime’s struggle [waves arms]. A never-ending fight. I say to you [hits podium] and you’ll understand that it is a privilege to fight!",2,17,24
Dwight," Salesman of Northeastern Pennsylvania, I ask you once more rise and be worthy of this historical hour!",2,17,24
Dwight, No revolution is worth anything unless it can defend itself. [bangs fists] ,2,17,24
Dwight," Some people will tell you salesman is a bad word. They’ll conjure up images of used car dealers and door to door charlatans. This is our duty – to change their perception. I say salesmen… and women of the world unite! We must never acquiesce for it is together, TOGETHER, THAT WE PREVAIL!  We must never cede control of the motherland! For it is… ",2,17,24
Dwight," Ok, thanks. [to Michael] There you are. What happened?",2,17,24
Dwight, It was amazing. I wish you would have been there.,2,17,24
Dwight," Little girl. Come over here. Shake my hand. Come on, I don’t have all day. [Abby shakes his hand] I don’t feel anything. Nothing. [to Jim] You’re so weak. [Jake walks over and messes with Dwight’s bobbleheads] Uh, excuse me, these are expensive collector’s items, okay? ",2,18,25
Dwight," No, I don’t have computer games on my work computer. That would be innappropriate. ",2,18,25
Dwight, You call your mom Meredith? That’s very disrespectful.,2,18,25
Dwight, You can refer to me as Mister Schrute. ,2,18,25
Dwight," [quietly] … Schrute. [Jim and Abby snicker, Angela glares at Dwight]  					",2,18,25
Dwight," [plays the recorder] That was Greensleeves. A traditional English Ballad about the beheaded Anne Boleyn. And now, a very special treat… a book my Grandmutter used to read me when I was a kid.  This is a very special story, it’s called Struwwelpeter, by Heinrich Hoffman from 1864. [reading from book] The great tall tailor always comes to little girls that suck their thumbs— are you listening, Sasha? Right? And ‘ere they dream when he’s about, he takes his great sharp scissors out, and then cuts their thumbs clean off!",2,18,25
Dwight," These are cautionary tales for kids, my Grandmata used to read these—",2,18,25
Dwight, [standing up] Nazi was a fascist movement…,2,18,25
Dwight, I was gonna teach the children how to make corn-husk dolls. ,2,18,25
Dwight," Uh, okay. But first, that’s not my name. ",2,18,25
Dwight, Well at least I’m not a horrible little latchkey kid who got suspended from school. So…,2,18,25
Dwight," And they do, your parents, love you very much.",2,18,25
Dwight," The Schrutes consider children very valuable. In the olden days, the women would bear many children, so we would have enough laborers to work the fields. And if it was an especially cold winter, and there weren’t enough grains or vegetables, they would eat the weakest of the brood. [Laughs] They didn’t eat the children.  					",2,18,25
Dwight, Ebay. Hm. Question! May I be in charge of the party planning festivities?,2,19,26
Dwight," Excellent. On my part, I did manage to reserve the…",2,19,26
Dwight, Let’s get the party started. [Begins ‘raising the roof’],2,19,26
Dwight," Party planning committee, listen up. Michael would like trick candles for his birthday cake, so make that a priority.",2,19,26
Dwight, Not my problem. Here is a list of things that Michael would like to be surprised by. [hands list to Pam],2,19,26
Dwight," Yes, but he doesn’t want to know when, or whom.",2,19,26
Dwight," It’s ‘For the Longest Time,’ by William Joel. It’s you favorite song.",2,19,26
Dwight," Uh, that’s a list price of four dollars and fifty cents.  Unfortunately, this item is on [watch beeps] back… order… [hangs up] Michael! Michael! Michael Michael Michael! Come here, come here, come here!  Come here! ",2,19,26
Dwight," Listen up everyone! It is 11:23 exactly, the exact moment when you emerged from your mother’s vaginal canal, so… huh?! Right, have a seat. Please.",2,19,26
Dwight, There is a tradition that the Hebrews have of hoisting the birthday boy up on a chair.,2,19,26
Dwight, So come help me celebrate Michael’s birth moment. Kevin! ,2,19,26
Dwight," On three, we’re going to hoist away! Ready? ",2,19,26
Dwight, One. Two. Three! [Michael is raised until his head hits the ceiling],2,19,26
Dwight, [pulls out wallet] Thirty nine… sixty.  					,2,19,26
Dwight," Why tip someone for a job I’m capable of doing myself? I can deliver food. I can drive a taxi. I can, and do, cut my own hair. I did, however, tip my urologist, because… I am unable to pulverize my own kidney stones.   					",2,19,26
Dwight," Hey temp, you know uh, we still got five feet of sandwich left [pulls ice cream cake out of freezer]. ",2,19,26
Dwight," Hell, yeah. Save room for ice cream cake. ",2,19,26
Dwight, [whispering] This is the most important day of the year. I can’t risk anything.,2,19,26
Dwight, What about that meeting… later… to discuss finances?,2,19,26
Dwight," Where have you been? And don’t say the bathroom, ’cause I kicked in all the stalls.",2,19,26
Dwight," Let’s go over some of the symptoms of marijuana use, shall we?  You tell me who this sounds like: slow moving, inattentive, dull, constantly snacking, shows a lack of motivation. ",2,20,27
Dwight," I like the people I work with generally, with four exceptions.  But someone committed a crime and I did not become a Lackawanna County Volunteer Sheriff’s deputy to make friends. And by the way, I haven’t.   				",2,20,27
Dwight," Stop! This is not Kelly Kapoor story hour.  Illegal drugs were consumed on company property, okay? Your ass is on the line, mister!  My ass is is on the line!  Now I’m going to ask you again.  What time did you go home last night? ",2,20,27
Dwight, I didn’t know that you were at a party on Saturday night. ,2,20,27
Dwight," Okay, I’m gonna need to search your car.  Give me you keys. ",2,20,27
Dwight," I go down to the police station on my lunch break. I tell a police officer, I know several, what I suspect you may have in your car. He requests a hearing from a judge and obtains a search warrant, once he has said warrant, he will drive over here, and make you give him the keys to your car, and you will have to obey him. ",2,20,27
Dwight, I can’t stop this investigation. It is my job. ,2,20,27
Dwight, …to investigate the crime scene. I have six more interviews to go and then I will reveal what I know.  ,2,20,27
Dwight, If you are attempting to compliment me then you have done a very good job. ,2,20,27
Dwight, …because being a narc is one of the hardest jobs that you can have…,2,20,27
Dwight, Oscar visited Mexico when he was five to attend his great-grandmother’s funeral. What does that mean to a United States law enforcement officer? He’s a potential drug mule.   				,2,20,27
Dwight, Have you ever taken any illegal drugs? ,2,20,27
Dwight, Do you think it’s possible that maybe you could have had some drugs in your system without you knowing about it? ,2,20,27
Dwight, I don’t want to blow this. This is what all good law enforcement officers dream of. The chance to solve an actual crime.   				,2,20,27
Dwight, Do you know what this is? [pushing a photo toward her],2,20,27
Dwight, [grabs pictures back and looks at it] Dammit.   				,2,20,27
Dwight," That’s ridiculous, of course it wasn’t me. ",2,20,27
Dwight," Knock it off, okay, I’m interviewing you. ",2,20,27
Dwight, [opens eyes wide in total surprise]  				,2,20,27
Dwight," I know you’re innocent, but I can’t look like I’m treating you any differently. ",2,20,27
Dwight, Attention everyone.  Drug testers are coming in a couple of hours to test everyone’s urine. ,2,20,27
Dwight, Company policy. If drugs are found on the premises there is automatic drug testing conducted within twenty-four hours. ,2,20,27
Dwight," No you cannot. It has to be official, and it ",2,20,27
Dwight," Kevin, what prescription drugs are you taking, besides Rogaine?",2,20,27
Dwight, You will be. That is the law according to the rules. ,2,20,27
Dwight," Hi, Linda. Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager. You might remember testing my urine a few years back when I was applying to be a volunteer sheriff’s deputy.  ",2,20,27
Dwight, Were you forced to do drugs at this concert? ,2,20,27
Dwight, I want him to have all the urine he needs. ,2,20,27
Dwight, I know that. Don’t you think I know that?   				,2,20,27
Dwight," My father’s name was Dwight Schrute. My grandfather’s name was Dwight Schrute. His father’s name Dwide Schrude. Amish. I loved my father very much. Every morning he’d wake up at dawn and make us biscuits with gravy. When I was little my dad and I played a lot of games together. My dad cheated a lot but I never busted him on it. I would have, except I didn’t know about it. He didn’t tell me till years later. I was shocked when I found out.   				",2,20,27
Dwight, It’s a uniform and I turned it in today when I tendered my resignation.,2,20,27
Dwight, I took an oath when I was sworn in and I broke that oath today.   				,2,20,27
Dwight, That’s fantastic because I’ve always felt that the security here sucked . ,2,20,27
Dwight," Thank you, Michael. Very nice. Great. [To Hank]  Can I have a gun? ",2,20,27
Dwight," Okay, I’ll have to bring in my bow staff. ",2,20,27
Dwight, I need to go over some details with you. ,2,20,27
Dwight," First of all, Hank, how many orange traffic cones do you have? ",2,20,27
Dwight, Oh! What is on your face? Is that a disguise?,2,21,28
Dwight," I.D. badges are long overdue. Security in this office park is a joke. Last year, I came to work with my spud gun in a duffel bag. I sat at my desk all day, with a rifle that shoots potatoes at 60 pounds per square inch. Can you imagine if I was deranged?  					",2,21,28
Dwight," Whoa.. wha… wait. If someone has a problem with me, why would they withdraw it six months ago?",2,21,28
Dwight, That is not true. Redact it. Redact it!,2,21,28
Dwight,"  Okay, question. [looks at Toby] When a name is withdrawn, does that also apply to the permanent misbehavior file in New York?",2,21,28
Dwight," I never smile if I can help it. Showing one’s teeth is a submission signal in primates. When someone smiles at me, all I see is a chimpanzee begging for its life.  					",2,21,28
Dwight, This is humongous. I am not a security threat… ,2,21,28
Dwight," And my middle name is ‘Kurt’, not ‘Fart’.",2,21,28
Dwight, I have another complaint for Jim’s permanent file.,2,21,28
Dwight," Ah… agh… dgh… Ahh! No, no! Four years of malfeasance unreported. This cannot stand.",2,21,28
Dwight, No! You calm down! Who’s side is Toby on? Who’s side are you on?,2,21,28
Dwight, Him or me? I cannot work with Jim anymore.,2,21,28
Dwight, One of us is out of here by the end of today! [runs out],2,21,28
Dwight," Do the right thing here, Michael. Okay, I have served you loyally for years.",2,21,28
Dwight," Oh, look, Jim. There’s a sales manager position open in Stamford. Want me to call Jan and tell her you’re interested? I could put in a good word for you, ’cause I’ll still be working here. Transfer! Transfer! Everybody! Transfer! Transfer! Transfer! Transfer!",2,21,28
Dwight," Come on, let’s go. Creed, Kevin, Oscar… andale! Let’s go.  					",2,21,28
Dwight," I would never, ever serve you. Not in a million, billion years.",2,22,29
Dwight," I know. It belonged to my grandfather. He was buried in it, so family heirloom.  				",2,22,29
Dwight," Impossible. Roulette is not a game of skill, it is a game of chance.",2,22,29
Dwight, [laughs] You can’t be serious. Are you serious?,2,22,29
Dwight," [scoffs] That’s ridiculous. You know what? Uh… Why don’t you move that coat rack? Excuse me, everyone! Attention in the office, please. Jim is about to prove his telekinetic powers and he needs absolute silence. Go ahead.",2,22,29
Dwight," Actually, it’s owned by Beakman Properties, and Dunder Mifflin is four years into a seven-year lease. ",2,22,29
Dwight," When Darryl was coming, you said you wanted me here for protection. ",2,22,29
Dwight, Code name Re/Max is here. No sign of Lan Jevinson.  				,2,22,29
Dwight," I’m Michael’s wingman. I’ve got his back. Two dates. He’s got two dates tonight. My job is to keep Jan away from Carol and vice versa. Michael said, “We must deceive them, so as not to hurt them, and in that way, we honor them.”  				",2,22,29
Dwight," I expect to do very well tonight. I have an acute ability to read people. Jim, for instance, has a huge tell. When he gets a good hand, he coughs.  				",2,22,29
Dwight," Evening, Angela. This is craps. I need to roll an eight. If I do, everyone wins. ",2,22,29
Dwight," Yeah! Yeah! [Kisses Angela, she slaps him and walks away smiling]",2,22,29
Dwight, Come on. [Turns to Jan] So where you staying? Radisson?,2,22,29
Dwight, Holiday Inn? The Hyatt in Wilkes-Barre? You staying with Michael?  				,2,22,29
Dwight," [sobbing] Jim is gone.  He’s gone.  I miss him so much.  Ooooh I cry myself to sleep, Jim!  [serious] ",3,1,31
Dwight," Well, he’s not dressed in women’s clothes, so…",3,1,31
Dwight," You could assume everyone is, and not say anything offensive.",3,1,31
Dwight, Jim told me you could buy gay-dar online.,3,1,31
Dwight, Yeah probably.  He didn’t tell the truth a lot.,3,1,31
Dwight, Damn.  [thinks]  I’ll try Brookstone.  					,3,1,31
Dwight," Uh, Michael knows Pam.  He asked me to do this just for him.  He has his own reasons.  					",3,1,31
Dwight,"  I think all the other office gays should identify themselves, or I will do it for them.",3,1,31
Dwight,  What about Phyllis?  She makes absolutely no attempt to be feminine!,3,1,31
Dwight,  Michael appears to be gay too.  And yet he is my friend.  I guess I do have a gay friend.    					,3,1,31
Dwight, [reading the note with the gay-dar]  “Hope this helps.  -Jim”  Nice!  					,3,1,31
Dwight," Shhh.  Don’t be scared.  [gay-dar beeps over Oscar’s belt buckle, Dwight smiles] It works.  [gay-dar goes off next to Dwight’s belt buckle]  …oh no.  					",3,1,31
Dwight," Monkey, I am an A. R. M., Assistant Regional Manager. ",3,2,32
Dwight, Can I have my neck pillow back? Michael! Can I have my neck pillow back?  ,3,2,32
Dwight," Oh, hey, how’s it going up there? Have you made any sales yet?",3,2,32
Dwight, So what kind of commissions you get up there?,3,2,32
Dwight," Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager, Dunder-Mifflin.",3,2,32
Dwight," I’ll talk to my buddy down at the station, stat.  ",3,2,32
Dwight," So I called my buddy down at the station today. Had them run a background check on Josh Porter. See if there’s any known aliases, et cetera.",3,2,32
Dwight, What would you have done? Been manager?,3,2,32
Dwight, You? A bottle capper?! [laughs in disbelief],3,2,32
Dwight," So, you ever been convicted of a felony?",3,2,32
Dwight, Coast Guard? So you know how to fight underwater?,3,2,32
Dwight, [directing people to their assigned seats] Take a seat down there.  Second from the end.,3,3,33
Dwight, Not everyone approves of Movie Monday.  I won’t say who.  ,3,3,33
Dwight, That’s not his fault!  He had to follow his heart!  ,3,3,33
Dwight," Ever since Michael dumped Jan for Carol, Jan’s been bitching out on him.  Reject a woman and she will never let it go.  One of the many defects of their kind.  Also weak arms.  ",3,3,33
Dwight,"  [outside in the parking lot, pacing back and forth] WAH!  GAH!  [breathing heavily]   ",3,3,33
Dwight, This is Dwight Schrute.  I am calling about an extremely sensitive matter.,3,3,33
Dwight, [exhales] I can’t talk here.  It’s too sensitive. ,3,3,33
Dwight," No, but we should discuss that another time.",3,3,33
Dwight," Pull over at exit 40.  There is a Liz Claiborne outlet.  I know you like that store.  Go inside and shop, until I can meet you.",3,3,33
Dwight, [walking into Michael’s office] I’m going… to the dentist.,3,3,33
Dwight, I have to have an emergency crown put in.,3,3,33
Dwight, Yes.  It’s a new dentist.  He’s far.  I might be gone… three hours.,3,3,33
Dwight, New blouse?  Halter top?  Camisole?  Teddy?  ,3,3,33
Dwight, Mostly get rid of waste.  Which is half the people there.  And clean house.  [to waitress in diner]  Right here.  It’s all for me.  Thank you.,3,3,33
Dwight," The decision to turn on Michael was difficult.  [pouring way too much syrup on his food] But once I did it, I didn’t look back.  And mostly I feel that Michael would approve.  It’s really what’s best for the branch.  And I could care less about my co-workers.  So [cutting his food, giving Jan a “so there” look], here we are.  It’s all, on the table.  I want… the branch.  And I await your decision.  ",3,3,33
Dwight," [shoveling waffles into his mouth] Oh, by the way.  There’s a new Ann Taylor outlet store near here.  I know you like their earrings.  ",3,3,33
Dwight," They have this new kind of quick drying bonding, so…",3,3,33
Dwight, Maybe that’s why he became a dentist.    ,3,3,33
Dwight, [reluctantly opens his mouth and Michael peers inside]  Ahh.  Aaaah.,3,3,33
Dwight," Well… Gosh, if you think I should.  Then I will.",3,3,33
Dwight," Assistant to the regional manager.  Thank you Michael, for staying on.   I really appreciate it.",3,3,33
Dwight, Hey… I can’t imagine this place without you.,3,3,33
Dwight," Yeah, when I’m ready, Mike. [Dwight exhales, Michael looks at the camera] Ok let’s do it.  ",3,3,33
Dwight," Thank you Michael.  I just want to say, to the few of you who will remain under my employ, that I intend to lead you into the black!  With ferocity!    ",3,3,33
Dwight," Oh please, don’t be naive.  But you can be in charge of the women.    ",3,3,33
Dwight," Well that was before.  I’m thinking about getting something German, something with decent gas mileage.  Plus, that convertible, it’s a ridiculous choice for this climate.",3,3,33
Dwight, I think the Sebring’s cool.  It’s cool.  The Seabring’s cool.  It has a cassette and it has a CD.,3,3,33
Dwight, [Dwight gets on his knees and puts his face down on the ground] Don’t fire me.  Please.,3,3,33
Dwight, [terrified] I HAVE EXCELLENT SALES NUMBERS!,3,3,33
Dwight, [sobbing] I’ll do anything!  Anything!  I’ll do your laundry for a month!  For a year!,3,3,33
Dwight," I’m sorry!  I’ll do anything, I swear. [squeaking, crying]",3,3,33
Dwight," You can’t.  You can’t.  But I promise I’ll never betray you again.  What can I do, Michael.  What can I do?  [Michael exhales]  What can I do?  [Dwight has his face to the ground but his butt raised high in the air] What can I do?  What can I do?",3,3,33
Dwight," If the branch is in trouble, there are things you can do.",3,3,33
Dwight, I know that we need to cut costs.  We could fire Meredith. That’s a big cost.,3,3,33
Dwight," Creed might be living here, we could charge him rent.",3,3,33
Dwight," The Schrutes are a very loyal breed. But I also have Mannheim blood from my German grandmother. And the Mannheims knew when to cut and run. No sense going down with a losing regime. But the Schrute blood… It’s amazing that when these two bloods mix, the whole thing didn’t explode.  ",3,3,33
Dwight, [laughs uproariously and applauds] Whoo!,3,4,34
Dwight," Michael, can you get me a pen from down in the warehouse?",3,4,34
Dwight, That is the way to go.  Instant death.  Very smart.,3,4,34
Dwight, You said you didn’t know how to say it.,3,4,34
Dwight," If my head ever comes off, I would like you to put it on ice.",3,4,34
Dwight," When I die, I wanna be frozen. And if they have to freeze me in pieces, so be it.  I will wake up stronger than ever because I will have used that time to figure out exactly why I died and what moves I could have used to defend myself better now that I know what hold he had me in.   				",3,4,34
Dwight," Mm, no.  Better make it two-thirds.  Easier to stop if it turns on us.",3,4,34
Dwight, Look [holding up sketch] I gave him a six foot extension cord so he can’t chase us.,3,4,34
Dwight," [grabbing ball] I got it.  When my mother was pregnant with me, they did an ultrasound and found she was having twins.  When they did another ultrasound a few weeks later, they discovered, that I had resorbed the other fetus.  Do I regret this?  No.  I believe his tissue has made me stronger.  I now have the strength of a grown man and a little baby. ",3,4,34
Dwight, Michael! [following Michael downstairs] Michael.   Michael … ,3,4,34
Dwight," Michael, get him away from your head!  He is covered in germs and bacteria!  ",3,4,34
Dwight, [trying to shove bird into a can] Argh… gah!,3,4,34
Dwight," What?  No, this is about the right size.",3,4,34
Dwight," I’m sorry, I grew up on a farm.  We slaughtered a pig whenever we wanted bacon.  My grandfather was reburied in an old oil drum. [pause] It would have fit if he had given me another minute.  				",3,4,34
Dwight, I need a box.  I need a box.  A small box… not too confining.,3,4,34
Dwight," No, I said one of them is not a nickel.",3,5,35
Dwight," Ok. A man and his son get into a car accident. They are rushed to the hospital. The doctor says, there is no way I can operate on this boy, … ",3,5,35
Dwight, A man is found hanging from the ceiling…,3,5,35
Dwight, Extremely excited? … Just very?  That’s cool.  ,3,5,35
Dwight," I am very excited. Ryan hasn’t made a sale yet, but more importantly, he hasn’t made an ally yet. Is he going to be a slacker-loser-wise-ass like Jim was? Or is he going to join the Dwight Army of Champions?  ",3,5,35
Dwight," When you are ready to see the sales office, the sales office will present itself to you. Your journey begins now.  ",3,5,35
Dwight," I hold in my hand, a beet seed. Take it. [Ryan tries to take it, Dwight closes hand] AH! [Ryan tries again and takes seed] When… Damn it.   ",3,5,35
Dwight," And just as you have planted your seed in the ground, I’m going to plant my seed in you.",3,5,35
Dwight, It’s called bull crap and a client can smell it from a mile away. ,3,5,35
Dwight," Oh hey, I forgot something in my car.  I’ll be right back. ",3,5,35
Dwight, Congratulations resourceful salesman. You have passed the second challenge. Welcome to Schrute Farm.   ,3,5,35
Dwight, It is time for your next test. You have planted the beet seed. You have walked the long lonely walk of loneliness.,3,5,35
Dwight, You know what your problem is? You know why you haven’t made any sales? Cause you think you know everything. You have to trust that maybe there are other people that can teach you things. Are you ready to learn? Are you ready for the final test? ,3,5,35
Dwight, Please be seated. [man runs behind Dwight],3,5,35
Dwight, Pay no attention to the spirits that haunt this hallowed ground. ,3,5,35
Dwight," Mose is my cousin and he lives here. He will always be my best friend. Unless things go well with Ryan today in which case, I won’t hang out with Mose so much anymore.  ",3,5,35
Dwight, What is the greatest danger facing Dunder Mifflin?,3,5,35
Dwight, Wrong. Flash floods. What is the true cause of Robert Mifflin’s suicide?,3,5,35
Dwight, Wrong. He hated himself. What is the DHARMA initiative?  ,3,5,35
Dwight," Final question, young Ryan Howard. What is Michael Scott’s greatest fear?",3,5,35
Dwight," Wrong. He’s not afraid of anything. Also, I would have accepted snakes. Fear is what it’s all about. You cannot sell while undergoing fear. You need to vanquish fear! One must wrestle fear to the ground. You will now wrestle my cousin Mose. ",3,5,35
Dwight, Ryan. Don’t. Ryan! You don’t have to wrestle him. Just get in the coffin. Ryan?,3,5,35
Dwight," Ryan, come on. I am sorry. I am sorry. Mose is sorry too. Look, he sent over a basket with eggs and some fat back bacon. And look, something he whittled.   ",3,5,35
Dwight," You still mad? It’s just Jim and I didn’t get along, and I didn’t want it to be that way again. You know, I wanted us to be a team. An unstoppable team that competed against other teams.",3,5,35
Dwight, Establish time frames. Keep the phrase “real dollars” in their head. And always keep the power in the conversation. That’s why you’re losing them on the cold calls. Cause you say the word please too much. ,3,5,35
Dwight," Michael always said, K.I.S.S. Keep it simple, stupid. Great advice, hurts my feelings every time.   ",3,5,35
Dwight, They did not. They didn’t have to say it to your face.,3,5,35
Dwight," Not everything’s a lesson, Ryan. Sometimes you just fail. It’s those online paper jerks. The whole business is changing. You know what? They’re going to be screwed once this whole internet fad is over. What are you doing? [Ryan throws egg at building] Oh no no no no! Ryan! Yes! Ryan the temp! Come on! Courtesy of Dunder Mifflin. Come on! Drive. ",3,5,35
Dwight," [Dwight chokes as Ryan downs a beer in one drink] Temp! Temp! Temp! Temp! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! Yes! Just think, that temp agency could have sent you anywhere. ",3,5,35
Dwight," Yeah, totally single. Hundred percent available.  					",3,6,36
Dwight," Pam wishes. [generalized laughing] Kelly, I’ll take this one. Diwali is a Celebration of the Coronation of the God-King Rama. After his epic battle with Ravana, the Demon King of Lanka. It symbolizes the battle between good and evil… ",3,6,36
Dwight, No![knocks coffee out of Stanley’s hand.] You’ll thank me later.  				,3,7,37
Dwight, Sorry. I just feel like we haven’t talked in awhile.,3,7,37
Dwight," Thank you very much. [hangs up cell phone] Okay, secretary says Wallace is away for the day and won’t be coming back into the office.",3,7,37
Dwight," But, do not worry. I have his home address right [presses cell phone button] here.",3,7,37
Dwight," But when I do, we’ll have something to talk about.  				",3,7,37
Dwight," So, do you know what you’re gonna say when he shows up?",3,7,37
Dwight," No. Bad idea. You need an attack plan. Here, I’ll be him, you be you. Let’s practice.",3,7,37
Dwight," [as David Wallace] Dum, dum, dum, dum… coming home from work.",3,7,37
Dwight," Well, the branch is no longer finicially viable. It’s simple dollars and cents.",3,7,37
Dwight," Listen, Scott… we’re losing money, okay? It’s not a charity; it’s a business. And it’s a dying business.",3,7,37
Dwight," [as David Wallace] Dum, dum, dum, du, doy, du, do… coming home from work…",3,7,37
Dwight," Ah. [takes a gulp of Gatorade and passes the bottle to Michael] Here, replinish your fluids.",3,7,37
Dwight, [referring to Michael’s ringing phone] who is it?,3,7,37
Dwight, Then it was an honor to have worked with you.,3,7,37
Dwight, My first day when you hazed me by spraying me with a fire extinguisher.,3,7,37
Dwight," Uh,… my first sale, my promotion to assistant regional manager, our basketball game, when you took me to the hospital, and told me that you cared about me.",3,7,37
Dwight, What about when Jan said the branch was closing?,3,7,37
Dwight," Stranford is closed! Michael, we’re not closed. Stamford is closed. Stamford is closed.",3,7,37
Dwight, [scoffs] I could beat that on a skateboard.,3,8,38
Dwight," Yeah, well my feet don’t. And I can still crush that time.",3,8,38
Dwight, Let’s just put it this way. Last weekend I outran a black pepper snake.,3,8,38
Dwight, I am fast. To give you a reference point. I’m somewhere between a snake and a mongoose. And a panther.  ,3,8,38
Dwight, The Japanese camp guards of World War II always chose one man to kill whenever a batch of new prisoners arrived. I always wondered how they chose the man who was to die. I think I would have been good at choosing the person.  ,3,8,38
Dwight," Well, well, well. Look what the cat dragged in from Stamford. ",3,8,38
Dwight, Fact – I am older. I am wiser. Do not mess with me.,3,8,38
Dwight, Hello. I don’t believe we’ve been introduced. Dwight Schrute. Assistant Regional Manager.,3,8,38
Dwight, I know everything about film. I’ve seen over 240 of them.,3,8,38
Dwight, Which is higher? Assistant Regional Manager or Regional Director in Charge of Sales? ,3,8,38
Dwight, Okay. So who gets paid more? Me or Andy? ,3,8,38
Dwight, But check that it’s covered by your health care provider!  ,3,8,38
Dwight, But the little cars go in the compact spot,3,8,38
Dwight, Do you mean to me? From you? Cause that’s how it works.,3,8,38
Dwight, That was my advice. Remember? I’m the one who suggested that you fire him. ,3,8,38
Dwight, And what advice has Andy given to you today that you have acted on? Would ‘none’ be an accurate estimate? None advice? [whispers] Fire Andy. Fire. Andy.  ,3,8,38
Dwight, If he even wants it. It doesn’t come with a pay raise.,3,8,38
Dwight," Uh, try double that. Classic TransAm, vintage American muscle. Please.",3,8,38
Dwight, That makes sense. I’d rather drive a classic TransAm than an XEarth.,3,8,38
Dwight, Well I hope 1985 has a time machine ’cause I drive an 87.,3,8,38
Dwight," Speaking of funerals, why don’t you go ahead and go die.",3,8,38
Dwight," If you were driving a TransAm, you would be the smartest idiot in the whole world.",3,8,38
Dwight, [coughs sentence] I was making fun of your comeback! That’s why it worked. [talks normally to camera] Totally got the best of that interchange.   ,3,8,38
Dwight," I’m cool, I’m cool, I’m so cool. Tell me what is going on. ",3,9,39
Dwight," I am greatly concerned about having a convict in the office. And I do not care if that convict is white, black, Asian, German, or some kind of halfsy. I do not like criminals.  				",3,9,39
Dwight, Prison Mike. What’s the very very worst thing about prison?,3,9,39
Dwight," Don’t worry, she’s dead. Oh wait. He’s dead. ",3,10,40
Dwight, I accidentally ran over it. It’s a Christmas miracle!,3,10,40
Dwight," Relax, OK. And because this is Christmas, I am going to roast this goose and prepare it with a wild rice dressing. Do we have any cayenne pepper in the kitchen?",3,10,40
Dwight, [to Pam] So can you watch this? I’m gonna get my carving knife out of the trunk. ,3,10,40
Dwight," No, Toby, this is different. He’s already dead.   					",3,10,40
Dwight," Once I brought in a duck. To prepare for lunch. And people got upset. Apparently, they got attached to the duck and didn’t want to see it killed.   					",3,10,40
Dwight," He was already dead. And we Schrutes use every part of the goose. The meat has a delicious, smoky, rich flavor. Plus you can use the molten goose grease and save it in the refrigerator, thus saving you a trip to the store for a can of expensive goose grease. ",3,10,40
Dwight," Ok, that is ridiculous. And totally against the spirit of Christmas. ",3,10,40
Dwight," [standing up] Oh, ouch. Michael, I don’t think there is anything wrong with the way you described her. ",3,10,40
Dwight, [over everybody else’s talking] Are we gonna cancel Hanukah as well?,3,10,40
Dwight," Michael. Sorry to interrupt. Uh, It appears we’re one bathrobe short.",3,10,40
Dwight, [putting things into a box] We are getting rid of everything that reminds you of Carol.,3,10,40
Dwight," Oh, look at this. [looks through papers] Your old condo closing papers. It’s riddled with Carol’s name. I wish I could throw this in the box. [Michael hits repeat to “Goodbye My Lover” on computer]",3,10,40
Dwight," Oh, look at this, she saved you two thousand dollars ’cause they failed to report a mold problem. [Continues to sift through papers] But wouldn’t that affect the final… How did she? Oh, oh, I see what she did. That is good. Wow. Carol is one smart cookie. ",3,10,40
Dwight, Pam and Karen. I am ordering you to cease and desist all party planning. Immediately. ,3,10,40
Dwight," As ranking number three in this office, I am order –",3,10,40
Dwight," Ah, no. [to Pam and Karen] You must turn over to me all Christmas decorations and party paraphernalia immediately that will be returned to you on January fourth. ",3,10,40
Dwight," No no, no, wait, wait, wait [raises hand] Permission to join the Validity Committee.",3,10,40
Dwight," Get out Jim. [Dwight tries to sit between Andy and Jim] Actually, um… [to two other people at the table] Sir, I’m going to need take this chair.",3,10,40
Dwight, I can’t… I can’t here what you’re saying. ,3,10,40
Dwight, [off screen at other end of table] What’re you talking about?,3,10,40
Dwight, [still off screen] Carol had a mustache?,3,10,40
Dwight, [off screen] What are you guys talking about? ,3,10,40
Dwight, Michael! Repeat what you said louder!  					,3,10,40
Dwight, It is my job to be there for Michael. How can I be there for Michael if I’m here for Michael? [food is thrown at Dwight’s face]   					,3,10,40
Dwight, Looks like you’ve got a little Nakiri knife action going there. ,3,10,40
Dwight," Yeah, I bet you wish you had a Nakiri, though. ",3,10,40
Dwight," Nah, I don’t know… Still think Nakiri’s better.",3,10,40
Dwight," Michael! Hey! Over here, Michael! [waves down Michael with a napkin and whistles to get attention]",3,10,40
Dwight," Oh, OK. Cindy! Yo, Cindy! Cindy! Hold its neck back and insert the knife below the jaw. Bring it all the way around, there’s going to be a good amount of blood. [Cindy looks confused. Woman next to Dwight is disgusted] Don’t let it bother you. Have a bucket there, for the blood… and the innards… and the feathers.  					",3,10,40
Dwight," Hey! It’s Angela! [Angela slams door shut, but not before Kevin sneaks out] Hey!",3,10,40
Dwight, No. It was awful. I couldn’t hear anything. [cheers from other party],3,10,40
Dwight," [into walkie-talkie] Monkey, this is Possum. Do you copy?",3,10,40
Dwight," [singing] Lady, from the moment I saw you standing all alone. You gave all the love that I needed…   					",3,10,40
Dwight, [singing along] pum pum pum pum pum pum pum  					,3,10,40
Dwight, [Cell phone beeps] What the? [Reading text message] “You have been compromised. Abort mission. Destroy phone.” Destroy phone? [Dwight throws phone off of the roof and walks away]  					,3,10,40
Dwight, For recording. Michael is on vacation and he’s asked me to record all meetings and to type up the transcripts.,3,11,41
Dwight, [leans into tape recorder] Let the record show that Jim Halpert is a liar!,3,11,41
Dwight, You can’t see… You can’t see my stomach.,3,11,41
Dwight," Unless you’re willing to tell me everything, I cannot accept this assignment. ",3,11,41
Dwight, [to Jim and Ryan] Michael hit a deer?  ,3,11,41
Dwight, Michael! Michael! [pokes head through blinds in Michael’s office] There’s an emergency in the warehouse.,3,11,41
Dwight, I have disconnected the office T1 line. I have ordered that that [referring to large picture of Michael and Jan in Jamaica on the wall] be taken down and destroyed all print outs from the bathroom. ,3,11,41
Dwight, Who did this to you? [refers to Pam crying] Where is he? ,3,11,41
Dwight, [takes off coat to tie around waist] It’s hot in here.,3,11,41
Dwight," I know. [puts arm around Pam who continues to cry] So you’re PMSing pretty bad, huh?  ",3,11,41
Dwight, Everything is fine. You are in the clear.,3,12,42
Dwight," Uh, yeah. It’s the safest part of the car. In the event of a crash, the driver always protects his side of the car first.   				",3,12,42
Dwight," No thank you, I never let anyone walk behind me. Seven out of ten attacks are from the rear. ",3,12,42
Dwight," Uh, yeah, but it will be easier to stop. I can always block the blow. I can counter it with… [Jim slaps Dwight]  				",3,12,42
Dwight," Erm, that’s one of the ‘Big guys.’ Been on hold this whole time. ",3,12,42
Dwight," Here is my card. It’s got my Cell number, my pager number, my home number, and my other pager number. I never take vacations, I never get sick, and I don’t celebrate any major holidays. ",3,12,42
Dwight, I like Karen. She’s pretty and appears intelligent. ,3,12,42
Dwight, My girlfriend is also beautiful and smart. She could be a model or a college professor which is intimidating to a lot of guys. ,3,12,42
Dwight, I overslept. Damn rooster didn’t crow. ,3,12,42
Dwight," Michael, I cannot tell you what I was doing there. But you have to trust me, I would never do anything to hurt you or this company. ",3,12,42
Dwight, That’s not the worst thing in the world. I’ll just stand up in front of the office and reveal our true love. It won’t be that bad. Look at Kelly and Ryan. ,3,12,42
Dwight," Well, I don’t have a lot of choices.   				",3,12,42
Dwight," Ahem-hem-hem. May I have your attention please? This will only take a moment of your time. Although I love this company more than almost anything in the world, I have decided to step down from my post and spend more time with my family. I do not fear the unknown and I will meet my new challenges head-on and I will succeed. And I will laugh in the faces of those who doubt me. It has been a pleasure working with some of you and I will not forget those of you soon but remember, while today it is me, we all shall fall. In other words, I am quitting. So… .  				",3,12,42
Dwight, I would like to give the rest of my belongings to Michael Scott. Just take them. Except this. ,3,12,42
Dwight," One of my life goals was to die right here in my desk chair. And today, that dream was shattered.   				",3,12,42
Dwight, I am ready to face any challenges that might be foolish enough to face me.   ,3,13,43
Dwight," How would I describe myself? Three words. Hard-working, Alpha male, Jackhammer, Merciless, Insatiable.   ",3,13,43
Dwight, There is nothing on my horizon except everything. Everything is on my horizon.   ,3,13,43
Dwight," [in Staples uniform] I got this job to make some money while I continue my employment search. And uh, it’s fine for the time being. Oops. Break’s over.  ",3,13,43
Dwight, [scoffs] Child’s play. Give me something hard to sell.  ,3,13,43
Dwight, Great. I will literally be standing right here if you need anything at all.,3,13,43
Dwight, I have snow tires and chains. Plus exceptional hand-eye coordination.,3,13,43
Dwight, [scoffs] Paper company. They’re only one of Staples’ top competitors in the area. ,3,13,43
Dwight," [to customer] Well, that question is meaningless. Just go with the copy paper. It’s your funeral. See how that works out for you.",3,13,43
Dwight, I don’t want to do your laundry anymore. ,3,13,43
Dwight, You did this for me? [camera pans to “Welcome Back Oscar” sign],3,13,43

Dwight," Ruddy cheeks, thick calves, no tats, no moles, no tats.  No, TATS.  Of course I want-",3,14,44
Dwight, Leave me alone and get the male stripper.,3,14,44
Dwight," No preference, what do you think redhead or brunette?",3,14,44
Dwight, Yes.  Jennifer Garner portrayed one on Alias.  It was one of her many aliases.  ,3,14,44
Dwight," Okay, I specifically ordered a stripper.",3,14,44
Dwight," Oh, okay good.  Well in the future please identify yourself as such.",3,14,44
Dwight," [Reading the text message] Is she hot?  Text back, “Kind of.”  ",3,14,44
Dwight," Elizabeth, I want you to sit here.  When the phone rings, answer it. ",3,14,44
Dwight, We hired you for three hours work and we’re going to get it.,3,14,44

Dwight," [Windows reboot sound] [Dwight holds out his hand, sighs]",3,15,45
Dwight," I don’t know. My mouth tastes so bad all of a sudden. [nasty, dry mouth-smaking noise]  					",3,15,45
Dwight, You look as beautiful as the Queen of England.,3,15,45
Dwight," The Shrutes have their own traditions.   We usually marry standing in our own graves. Makes the funerals very romantic, but the weddings are a bleak affair.  					",3,15,45
Dwight, Why are all these people here? There are too many people on this Earth. We need a new plague. Who are all these people?,3,15,45
Dwight,"  I saw Wedding Crashers accidentally. I bought a ticket for Grizzly Man and went into the wrong theatre. After an hour, I figured I was in the wrong theatre, but I kept waiting. That’s the thing about bear attacks, they come when you least expect it.  					",3,15,45
Dwight," Once again, Jim, I will take care of this. I will locate the wedding crashers and report them to Phyllis. That way I won’t have to get her a gift.  					",3,15,45
Dwight," Best of luck, Phyllis. Also I’m going to need to see a copy of the guest manifest as well as photographs of the caterers.",3,15,45
Dwight," ‘Scuse me, sir. How do you know the happy couple?",3,15,45
Dwight, The bride and groom? What are their names?,3,15,45
Dwight," Oh I get it, I get it, come on, freeloader. Let’s move it. Come on. Come on.",3,15,45
Dwight," Got to find yourself another wedding to crash, my friend.",3,15,45
Dwight," You are a real life wedding crasher and I must bounce you. I’m sorry, it gives me no pleasure.",3,15,45
Dwight, “Don’t be an idiot.” Changed my life.  				,3,16,46
Dwight," Whenever I’m about to do something, I think, “Would an idiot do that?” And if they would, I do not do that thing.  				",3,16,46
Dwight, …Oh my God. Animal stool. [jumps on desk],3,16,46
Dwight," Solving a mystery, if that’s quite alright with you. [opens ceiling tile] Come to Papa. Okay, ladies and gentlemen, what we have here is a bird that has been trapped in a vent. Fortunately I have found it befo–BAT! BAAAT! BAT! ",3,16,46
Dwight, BAAAAT! BAT! NO! EVERYONE REMAIN CALM! There it goes!,3,16,46
Dwight," At Six?! No, that is unacceptable. Okay, Jim, you are the number two in this office. You need to step up and show some leadership. ",3,16,46
Dwight," If a vampire bat was in the U.S., it would make sense for it to come to a “sylvania.” Like PENN-sylvania. Now that doesn’t mean that Jim is going to become a vampire. Only that he carries the vampiric germ.  				",3,16,46
Dwight," I don’t have a lot of experience with vampires, but I have hunted werewolves. I shot one once. But by the time I got to it, it had turned back into my neighbor’s dog.  				",3,16,46
Dwight, Extraordinary events call for extraordinary actions. We form an allegiance–,3,16,46
Dwight, Do you have the tools to turn a wooden mop handle into a stake?,3,16,46
Dwight, Flush him towards the door. On my go… NOW! ,3,16,46
Dwight, Animal control? I’ve been controlling animals since I was six.,3,16,46
Dwight," Jim is on a path now. An eternal journey, and I wish him well. But I have a destiny in this realm. Specifically, in the kitchen.  				",3,16,46
Dwight, Magic time. Gyeeeaahhh! [puts bag over Meredith’s head],3,16,46
Dwight, …[captures bat in bag] … You’re welcome.   				,3,16,46
Dwight, I know how. Dislocate his shoulder and slip his arm out from underneath.,3,17,47
Dwight," Let me smell. [Michael breathes at Dwight] Good, not great.   ",3,17,47
Dwight, That would have been really embarrassing.,3,17,47
Dwight," Oh, you know that line on the top of the shrimp? That’s feces.   ",3,17,47
Dwight, Do you ever watch Battlestar Galactica?,3,17,47
Dwight," These old colonials are great, when they’re sound. I’d love to take a look around.",3,17,47

Dwight," Huh. [Bangs on wall] Yeah, these studs are way too far apart. What’s in here? [Opens door]. ",3,17,47
Dwight," Oh good, you’re up. Hey, who makes this chair?",3,17,47
Dwight, I want one. It’s got good solid construction. Comfortable. What is this? Oak?,3,17,47
Dwight," The chimney is in decent shape. Not great. I found some termite damage in a crawl space and some structural flaws in the foundation so all in all, it was a pretty fun cocktail party.   ",3,17,47
Dwight," Don’t break up you guys, you’re great together.   ",3,17,47
Dwight," Everyday, for eight years, I have brought pepper spray into this office to protect myself and my fellow employees.  And everyday, for eight years, people have laughed at me.  Well, who’s laughing now? [Dwight blinks and winces in pain from the pepper spray]  				",3,18,48
Dwight," Thank you not necessary and thus, not accepted.  I saw someone breaking the law and I interceded.",3,18,48
Dwight, Don’t want it.  Won’t open it.  Don’t need it.  Won’t take it.  Citizens do not accept prizes for being citizens.  				,3,18,48
Dwight," No, don’t call me a hero.  Do you know who the real heroes are?  The guys who wake up every morning, and go into their normal jobs, and get a distress call from the commissioner, and take off their glasses and change into capes and fly around fighting crime.  Those are the real heroes.  				",3,18,48
Dwight," I saw the perpetrator advance toward the victim at a high rate of speed.  His head was thrown back, his shoulder and arm cocked indicating an attack position.  Perp grabbed the victim.  I removed my weapon from its secure hiding place.",3,18,48
Dwight," Irrelevant.  Discharged it at a distance of a little over a meter into the perpetrator’s eyes, nose, and face area.  Rendering him utterly and completely disabled.  Then I contacted the authorities.  The end.",3,18,48
Dwight," When Han Solo returns to the Death Star in the Millennium Falcon, and shoots down the TIE fighters and saves the Rebel cause, do you think he does so for a free beer?",3,18,48

Dwight," I am not a hero.  I am a mere defender of the office.  You know who’s a real hero?  Hiro, from ",3,18,48
Dwight," Yes, I have decided to shun Andy Bernard for the next three years.  Which I’m looking forward to.  It’s an Amish technique.  It’s like slapping someone with silence.  I was shunned from the age of four until my sixth birthday… for not saving the excess oil from a can of tuna.  					",3,19,49
Dwight," Jim, could you please inform Andy Bernard that he is being shunned.",3,19,49
Dwight," Ok, no.  Jim, tell him that bears can climb faster than they can run.  Jim!  Tell him!",3,19,49

Dwight, [hesitates] Un-shun.  I think he’s suffering from depression. Re-shun.,3,19,49
Dwight, Un-shun.  Never.  Re-shun.  I think he wants you all to come out to the parking lot and watch him die!,3,19,49

Dwight," Oh… It’s uh, a Repliee Q1 Expo female robot, they’re only available in Japan.",3,19,49
Dwight, Well that’s debatable.  There are basically two schools of thought—,3,20,50
Dwight, Bears do not— What is going on— What are you doing?!  				,3,20,50
Dwight," You know what?  Imitation is the most sincere form of flattery, so I thank you. [Jim places a bobble-head on his desk]  Identity theft is not a joke, Jim!  Millions of families suffer every year!",3,20,50

Dwight, [snaps picture with his camera phone] You look good in this.,3,20,50
Dwight, May I point out that the sex appeared to be consensual?  Both animals were smiling.,3,20,50
Dwight," I grew up on a farm.  I have seen animals having sex in every position imaginable.  Goat on chicken.  Chicken on goat.  Couple of chickens doin’ a goat, couple of pigs watching.  Whoever drew this got it exactly right.  				",3,20,50
Dwight," Uh, you could never withstand a SWAT team.",3,20,50
Dwight, They would flank you.  Throw in a concussion grenade.,3,20,50

Dwight," The Aristocrats. A man and his wife and his children go into the offices of a talent agency. And the talent agent says, “Describe your act.” And the man says something really, really raunchy and the talent representative says, “What do you call yourselves?” And the man says, “The Aristocrats!”   				",3,22,52
Dwight, [finishes story] I mean truly repulsive acts. ,3,22,52
Dwight," But that’s my name. [opens letter and reads] Dwight, congratuations a-wipe.  Don’t screw the pooch. [begins to cry]  Thank you. ",3,23,53
Dwight," [sobbing, holding letter to chest] Thank you so much. ",3,23,53
Dwight," How would you like to spend the night with the Regional Manager of Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton?",3,23,53
Dwight," No, no, not Michael. [whispers] Me. I’m taking his job. ",3,23,53
Dwight," [squeezing hand grips] Jim, Jim, Jim.  Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim. ",3,23,53
Dwight, I am gonna be your new boss. [laughs] It’s my greatest dream come true.  Welcome to the Hotel Hell.  Check in time is now.  Check out time is never. ,3,23,53
Dwight," Sorry, we’re all booked up. Hell convention in town. ",3,23,53
Dwight, I’m the owner.  The co-owner. With Satan!,3,23,53
Dwight," Yeah, but I haven’t told you my salary yet. ",3,23,53
Dwight, Eighty thousand dollars a year.    				,3,23,53
Dwight, Once I’m officially Regional Manager my first order of business will be to demote Jim Halpert. So I will need a new number two.  My ideal choice? Jack Bauer. But he is unavailable. Fictional. And overqualified.   				,3,23,53
Dwight," Okay, everyone, listen up! [claps]  Time to begin the interview process! [looks at sign-up sheet, only contains Andy’s name]  Andrew Bernard.",3,23,53
Dwight," No! Hey, hey, hey, hey!  Do not wish them luck.  Do not wish them luck.  All luck must be wished unto Michael.",3,23,53
Dwight, I am going to begin this process with a simple test of intelligence and mental dexterity.  What is the best color?,3,23,53
Dwight, Wrong.  Black.  It is the most dominant.  How do you make a table?,3,23,53
Dwight," Okay, also, moratorium on Cornell talk.  Don’t wanna hear about it.  Forget your personal history, and learn the history of this company.",3,23,53
Dwight," You’re not off to a very good start, Bernard. ",3,23,53
Dwight," [Andy and Dwight arm-wrestle, Andy is about to win] Time! No, you failed. ",3,23,53
Dwight, This interview is over. I’ll let you know.   				,3,23,53
Dwight, [Dwight clicks off tape player] Who’s ready to work?   				,3,23,53
Dwight, My first order of business: make Andrew Bernard my number two.,3,23,53
Dwight, As if you had a choice. [scoffs] Duh. [scoffs] Opportunity of a lifetime. [spits chew into Michael’s World’s Best Boss mug]  				,3,23,53
Dwight, You showed great leadership potential at the coal walk.  Even if you did follow it with that embarrassing personal confession.,3,23,53
Dwight," I had to make Andy my number two.  It’s political, complicated, you wouldn’t understand.  I want you… to be Assistant Regional Manager.",3,23,53
Dwight," Well, in a sense.  Although, publicly I am going to retain the Assistant Regional Manager position.",3,23,53
Dwight," Correct, I need someone I can trust.  But I would also like the title… to be secretly applied to you.  Just stripped of its pomp and frills.",3,23,53
Dwight," Mmmmmm, let’s call it Secret Assistant ",3,23,53
Dwight," Listen up!  Come to the center of the room, please.  This… [holds up paper that resemles a sheet sized dollar bill with Dwight’s face in the middle] is a Schrute Buck.  When you have done something good, you will receive one Schrute Buck.  One thousand Schrute Bucks… equals an extra five minutes for lunch.  ",3,23,53
Dwight," Excellent question, Pam.  1/100th of a cent.",3,23,53
Dwight, Just… zip your lid!  Another announcement.  Michael wasted an enormous amount of the group’s time and patience with non-work related ethnic celebrations and parades of soft-minded dogoodedness.  No longer.  No more meetings!,3,23,53
Dwight," Instead, today I will begin my first lecture in a long series of lectures designed to increase your knowledge on the world of paper.",3,23,53
Dwight," Yes!  Michael is gone.  There’s a new sheriff here in these offices, and his name is “me.”  Conference room!  Ten seconds!  All of you!  				",3,23,53
Dwight, Listen up.  Let’s start… from the ground ,3,23,53
Dwight," Soil. Right.  We have, in front of you here, seven different types of Pennsylvania top soil.  Now, what would you say… is the most important element in the production of above ground leafy growth?  Probably phosphorus, right? [Angela smiles, shakes her head “no”]  Wrong!  It’s nitrogen!  Absorb this information.  Good!  Now, let us discuss precipitation.  Stanley!  When rainfall occurs, does it usually fall in a liquid, solid, or gaseous… state?",3,23,53
Dwight, Very good!  You have earned one Schrute Buck.,3,23,53
Dwight, Then you have been deducted 50 Schrute Bucks!,3,23,53
Dwight, We— Don’t you wanna earn Schrute Bucks?,3,23,53
Dwight, What’s the ratio of Stanley Nickels to Schrute Bucks?,3,23,53
Dwight," No, no, no, wait!  Class is not canceled.",3,23,53
Dwight," It’s like outerspace without the stars, it’s so black. [laughs]",3,23,53
Dwight," It’s so intimidating!  Anyone who comes in here… is gonna have to take me seriously.  Abandon all hope, ye who enter here!",3,23,53
Dwight," I wanted to thank you… for helping me, when you held the title, Secret Assistant to the Regional Manager.  You served the office with great dignity. [Pam salutes Dwight, Dwight returns the salute]  				",3,23,53
Dwight, No need we can just check the security tapes.,4,1,55
Dwight, Did you get sick of that face? Did she owe you money? Uh-oh. Is this downsizing? Did she spurn your advances?  				,4,1,55
Dwight," Check to see if she’s faking. If a car hit me, it wouldn’t crack my pelvis. You know what; I bet she cracked it at home. Jumped in front of the car to get some workers comp.",4,1,55
Dwight," Well you left the TV on, and your cat is dead.",4,1,55
Dwight," So… Hey come on, don’t be sad, just… OK… just. She’s in a better place.",4,1,55
Dwight," Actually the place that she’s in is the freezer, because of the odor.",4,1,55
Dwight, Cats do not provide milk or wool or meat.,4,1,55
Dwight," As a farmer, I know that when an animal is sick, sometimes the right thing to do is to put it out of its misery. With the electricity we’re using to keep Meredith alive we could power a small fan for 2 days. You tell me what’s unethical.  				",4,1,55
Dwight, Blink once if you want me to pull the plug.,4,1,55
Dwight," Pfft… Her chart doesn’t indicate that she had a hysterectomy but she did, or at least she got time off for one.",4,1,55
Dwight," So, just to be safe they are giving her the rabies vaccine.",4,1,55
Dwight," No, no. You’ve gotta be bitten by something.",4,1,55
Dwight," Actually the doctor said it was lucky she came in to the hospital, cause the only way to beat rabies, is to start treatment before the symptoms set in… Lock jaw.",4,1,55
Dwight," You’re taking this out on me, but I was only the messenger.",4,1,55
Dwight, [sighs] You’ll feel better after the 5k. Exercise is good for depression.,4,1,55
Dwight," Well I don’t know, on the other hand it does leave less money for bat birth control.",4,1,55
Dwight," Wait, this money is going to bat birth control, right Michael, that’s what you told me when I contributed.",4,1,55
Dwight, Maybe we should just skip the ceremony and setup a college fund for Meredith’s son.,4,1,55
Dwight," You’ve got nothing to worry about, I put Imodium in Toby’s coffee before the race.",4,1,55
Dwight, Well you look cute as a button. You’ve worked up quite a sweat.,4,1,55
Dwight," OK, when a farmer sees an animal that is in pain, that has no quality of life, that has no utility, a farmer does what city folk don’t have the stomach to do.",4,1,55
Dwight, It was beautiful and gentle and respectful. I fed her antihistamines and she gradually fell asleep.,4,1,55
Dwight," Hey, Oww! [looks around to onlookers] It’s OK.",4,1,55
Dwight," I thought I was helping you. I expected a hug. I took care of that cat, the best way I knew how.",4,1,55
Dwight," I know a great taxidermist. I’ll pay to have her stuffed. Well he’s not great, but he’s pretty good.",4,1,55
Dwight," Or we can have her buried out at the east field, by mother. Huh, Angela?",4,1,55
Dwight, I don’t see it. I think they both could do better.  				,4,2,56
Dwight, To give you this [reveals a cat from under a coat].,4,2,56
Dwight, It’s a feral barn cat. I trapped him last night and I’m giving him to you as a replacement cat for the one I destroyed.,4,2,56
Dwight, And his name is… Garbage. Mose calls him Garbage because he likes to eat garbage. [shakes cat] Don’t you Garbage? [makes chomping noises],4,2,56
Dwight," Garbage can be very helpful. OK, he’s a youthful cat. He killed an entire family of raccoons. [holds cat towards Angela] Look at him.",4,2,56
Dwight, What if we don’t want to use a Blackberry because they are stupid and pointless?,4,2,56
Dwight," I’ll make a reservation. No, no. Let me cook for you. Cauliflower and noodles. Baked potato on the side.",4,2,56
Dwight," I’m gonna live for a very long time. My grandma Schrute lived to be 101. My grandpa Manheim is 103, and still puttering around in Argentina. I tried to go visit him once, but my travel visa was protested by the Shoah Foundation.  				",4,2,56
Dwight, Are you enjoying your vegetarian noodles?,4,2,56
Dwight," Then don’t look in my eyes. Look right here [points to middle of forehead above the eyes], it’s an old sales trick.",4,2,56
Dwight,  That’s ridiculous.  I’m not going to be beaten by a website.,4,3,57
Dwight,"  I can make more sales than a computer.  In fact, I challenge that website to make more sales than me today.",4,3,57
Dwight,  I just feel like we need something more to acknowledge when I make a sale.,4,3,57
Dwight,  Go to my car.  Open the trunk.  Inside you will see many pelts.  Under the smallest one is a case.  Inside that case is a bear horn.  Bring it to me.,4,3,57
Dwight," Hey, you wanna win?  You gotta fuel like a winner.",4,3,57
Dwight," Uhyeaahhh!  Hello, Susan?  Dwight Schrute. ",4,3,57
Dwight,  Today I’m prepared to give you 15% off our normal prices.,4,3,57
Dwight,"  Three reams! Yoohoo… in your face, machines.",4,3,57
Dwight,  What if I told you I could offer free shipping?  Sure.  I’ll hold.,4,3,57
Dwight,  It appears that the website has become alive.  This happens to computers and robots sometimes.  Am I scared of a stupid computer?  Please.  The computer should be scared of me!  I have been salesman of the month for 13 out of the last 12 months.  You heard me right.  I did so well last February that Corporate gave me 2 plaques in lieu of a pay raise.  				,4,3,57
Dwight,"  No, I realize you normally reorder in November, but what I’m suggesti… you did what?  Ah no!  That’s exactly what you’re not supposed to do, damnit!  Why would you reorder from a computer when you can have the personal touch of a salesman?  Ahhhhh. [hangs up phone]",4,3,57
Dwight,  What are you doing?  I am in the fight of my life against this computer and every sale counts.,4,3,57
Dwight,  Damnit Kelly!  It knows!  It knows what you did!  ,4,3,57
Dwight,"  Y… You don’t understand. If… okay, if this makes the difference, I’m gonna tell it that you were responsible.",4,3,57
Dwight,"  I am not a bad person.  When I left Staples, I took some of their leads with me but I never intended to use them.  What did I intend to do with them?  Who knows?  Maybe keep them as a souvenir.  Maybe use them.  				",4,3,57
Dwight,"  Yes, Mr. Galliado.  How would you like to pay ten percent less for paper than you’re paying right now?  It’s not important how I got your information.  What is important is that you say yes.  Good.  				",4,3,57
Dwight,  Perfect.  So let me just get some basic information from you. Mmmhmm.,4,3,57
Dwight,"  I’m sorry.  Am, so sorry.  I… yes.  Uh, could you repeat that?  				",4,3,57
Dwight,  Yesss!  Ten reams for the US District Court!  Did I happen to mention the forty reams for the battered women’s shelter?,4,3,57
Dwight,  Reams. Wait. Say it. Say it again.  Announce it again.,4,3,57
Dwight,  Hey.  So. What do you think?  I did it for you.,4,3,57
Dwight, I think it’s inappropriate to date someone you work with.,4,3,57
Dwight," Uh, she works in the annex.  You’re also welcome to date Toby.",4,3,57
Dwight, I’ve seen this kid before. He’s one the kids who sneaks on my farm and steals my hemp.  				,4,3,57
Dwight, We’re a paper company.  The best paper company in the whole wide world.,4,3,57
Dwight," Listen up kid.  [pops balloon with his hands]  I don’t like you, but because some town in Switzerland says so, you have rights.",4,3,57
Dwight," It’s just ice, it’ll melt all over the floor.",4,3,57
Dwight, [kicks open bathroom door] If you’re going number one you’ve got ten more seconds!  				,4,3,57
Dwight, I’m just scaring him.  The trick is to make him think you’re going to do something to him.,4,3,57
Dwight," Shut up, or I’m going to punch you in the throat!",4,3,57
Dwight," You had to, what other choice did you have?",4,3,57
Dwight," Here we go, sixty-five.  You know what?  There’s two more.",4,3,57
Dwight," Alright.  Oh, I assume I’m going to be reimbursed for the pizzas.",4,3,57
Dwight,  And I spent so much time in Scranton and I never sold any paper.,4,3,57
Dwight," Now I’ve got a beard, and I can do whatever I want, and I’m your boss.",4,3,57
Dwight," I don’t get that, I don’t understand that.",4,3,57
Dwight," [picks up phone]  Dunder Mifflin, Dwight Schrute. Please hold. [opens book, then picks up phone] Schrute Farms, guten tag. How can I help you? Yes, we have availability on those nights. How many in your party? Oh no, I’m sorry, no king beds. No queen either. Well, we make our own mattresses that don’t conform to the traditional sizes. Closest would be twin. Thank you so much for calling. Call back again. Aufedersein!",4,4,58
Dwight," Agrotourism is a lot more than a bed and breakfest. It consists of tourists coming to a farm, showing them around, giving them a bed, giving them brekafest.  ",4,4,58
Dwight," I’m not telling you anything. [lookings into the camera] Permits are pending. [phone rings] Dwight Schrute, Dunder Mifflin.",4,4,58
Dwight," Okay, this is a mis-use of company phones. ",4,4,58
Dwight," Trip Advisor is the life blood of the Agrotourism industry. A couple of bad reviews there, you might as well close up shop. That’s what took down the Stalk Inn. One of the cutest little asparagus farms you’ll ever see.  ",4,4,58
Dwight," We offer tours of the fields, and of the barn. Uh, perhaps you’ll be interested in, um, Mose’s table making demonstration?  ",4,4,58
Dwight," One cardigan, one sleeping cardigan and one sleep apnea mask.",4,4,58
Dwight," You are incorrect. I was recently scrubbing my room of memories, and I didn’t see it there.",4,4,58
Dwight," My girlfriend and I broke up recently. And I must say, I am relieved. Gives me a chance to sow my wild oats. In the Schrute family, we have a tradition, where when the male has sex with another woman, he is rewarded with a bag of wild oats left on his door step by his parents. You can use these oats to make oatmeal, bread, whatever you want. I don’t care, they’re your oats.  ",4,4,58
Dwight," We have three rooms, each with a different theme.",4,4,58
Dwight," I’ll put you down for Irrigation. Well then, do you have any special needs or diertary restrictions?",4,4,58
Dwight," Here we are, the Irrigation Room! A very special room. So I’ll come get you before the table-making demonstration. And as of this morning, we are completely wireless here in Schrute Farms. But as soon as I find out where Mose hid all the wires, we’ll get that power back on. All righty.  ",4,4,58
Dwight," Mose, what are you doing? No Mose! Put the— Put the manure down! Put it down! Do not throw it! DO NOT THROW IT! Ow!  ",4,4,58
Dwight," [reading to Jim, Pam, and Mose] And Harry saw the white hand raise its wand, and felt Voldemort’s surge of vicious anger. Saw the frail old man on the floor write in agony. “Harry?” It was over quickly as it had come. Harry stood shaking in the darkness, clutching the gate in the garden, his heart racing.  ",4,4,58
Dwight," [Jim knocks on Dwight’s door, crying stops] Come in. Did you have another nightmare?",4,4,58
Dwight, Is everything satisfactory with your stay?,4,4,58
Dwight, Oh. Well I’ll look into that in the morning. Thank you for bringing that to the attention of the staff.,4,4,58
Dwight, I am better than you have ever been or ever will be. [Ryan walks in],4,4,58
Dwight," [sobbing, reaches out to Jim after he walked away]  ",4,4,58
Dwight," [takes a ruler and shoves it between his desk and Jim’s, knocking Jim’s files on the floor]  Hello, this is Dwight Schrute calling from Dunder-Mifflin, and according to our records you appear to be low on office supplies.  Okay, sure, yeah I can take care of that right now.  ",4,4,58
Dwight," Second Life is not a game. It is a multi-user virtual environment. It doesn’t have points or scores, it doesn’t have winners or losers.",4,5,59
Dwight, I signed up for Second Life about a year ago. Back then my life was so great that I literally wanted a second one. In my Second Life I was also a paper salesman and I was also named Dwight. Absolutely everything was the same. Except I could fly. [shot of Dwight’s avatar flying around]  				,4,5,59
Dwight," We cannot talk about this… because, someone might hear us. ",4,5,59
Dwight," Angela can stay the same, but we’ll change Andy to Dwight.",4,5,59
Dwight, I won’t need to because we’ll be together playing hooky.  Yeah.,4,6,60
Dwight," Well, gee, Jim, I don’t know, I guess there’s no sales call today.",4,6,60
Dwight, [throws Jim’s cell phone out of the window] Gah-ah-hah-ha!,4,6,60
Dwight, No communication with the outside world Jim.,4,6,60
Dwight," Come on, I already filled the bottles with the gas, it’s going to be so badass.",4,6,60
Dwight," Well you said that we couldn’t make anymore stops, and I really had to go.",4,6,60
Dwight, I think I cut my penis on the lid!  				,4,6,60
Dwight," And if we have to defend ourselves, I will stab the security guy in the eye with the jumbo chalk.",4,6,60
Dwight, Then I’ll grind up the jumbo chalk and blow it in his eyes.,4,6,60
Dwight, [from the walkie-talkie] We are climbing some stairs.,4,6,60
Dwight," There’s a security guard coming by.  Hello, we’re warehouse workers.  Would you like more proof?",4,6,60
Dwight, I have to do something to his eyes.  				,4,6,60
Dwight, The eyes are the groin of the head.  				,4,6,60
Dwight," Don’t leave us, help us, we need help Jim!",4,6,60
Dwight, Do not tell Karen about the industrial copier.,4,6,60
Dwight," Listen lady, you can expect these kind of repercussions as long as you keep trying to poach our people.",4,6,60
Dwight, Let’s see if any of these will work. [clears the front of Michael’s desk],4,7,61
Dwight," I keep various weaponries strategically placed around the office. I saved Jim’s life with a can of pepper spray I had velcroed under my desk. People say, “Oh, it’s dangerous to keep weapons in the home or the work place.” Well I say, “It’s better to be hurt by someone you know accidentally, than by a stranger on purpose.”  				",4,7,61
Dwight, Do I believe that Michael possesses the skills to survive in a hostile environment? Let’s put it this way:,4,7,61
Dwight," No, I would never leave you for dead. You would never escape.",4,7,61
Dwight," First, I would remove your teeth and cut off your fingertips so you could not be identified. ",4,7,61
Dwight, And they would call me the Overkill Killer.,4,7,61
Dwight, It would be better if you were unconscious.,4,7,61
Dwight, [leading Michael from car] Here we go. Just the two of us [gestures for camera crew to follow]  				,4,7,61
Dwight," Here we go, into the wild. Mighty forest. Can you smell the trees and the nature?  				",4,7,61
Dwight," Keep going, you’re fine. Just some bushes and some thickets [leads Michael into some tall grass] Keep going. You wanted wilderness, you got it.   				",4,7,61
Dwight, Good a spot as any. [They stop and Dwight starts spinning Michael around in circles],4,7,61
Dwight, Spin. I’m trying to confuse your sense of direction. [stops spinning and takes Michael’s blindfold off] Behold. ,4,7,61
Dwight, Here’s your knife. Here’s your duct tape. ,4,7,61
Dwight," I lied to Michael. I said that I would leave him alone, but I will not. I will remain close by to provide unseen moral support, but I will never help him. I will let harm befall him. I will even let him die. But I will never let him lose his dignity.  				",4,7,61
Dwight, Michael is a man of great depth and passion. I don’t know what he’s searching for out here. [pulls a nest from a tree] I hope he finds it. [picks up some bird eggs] Lunch.   				,4,7,61
Dwight, About two more minutes [cooking bird eggs].  				,4,7,61
Dwight, Nothing to worry about. Just using the scope. Safety is… [clicks rifle into safety mode] on.  				,4,7,61
Dwight," Stop! No, no Michael! Nooo! Nooo! [runs up to Michael and knocks him over] Nooo! Arghh. Get, get them out. [picks out mushrooms from Michael’s mouth]   				",4,7,61
Dwight,"  No, no, no. This is your last meal. There will be no leftovers.",5,1,63
Dwight,  [sprays food with bug poison] There. Take those home to your wife.,5,1,63
Dwight,"  Hit the scales, everybody. Right on that black platform. This way. Step it up.",5,1,63
Dwight,  Wait a minute. One more bite of eclair each. Hold it in your mouth if you can’t swallow.,5,1,63
Dwight, [forces candy out of vending machine and forces fruit into racks]  				,5,1,63
Dwight,"  It’s not gonna take her 10 minutes to fax it, Jim. [to Pam] If I don’t see you again, goodbye. Well, actually, I’ll see you when you give me the fax confirmation, so never mind.  				",5,1,63
Dwight,"  [exiting warehouse storage room] Ahh. We done good in there, half pint.",5,1,63
Dwight,"  OK, can you turn the girl off please? I’m trying to get some work done.",5,1,63
Dwight,"  Come on, Bernard. [Andy spits on floor as warehouse worker walks past]",5,1,63
Dwight,  Not that guy who murdered his mother. He was not so handsome. Also Kevin.,5,1,63
Dwight,"  Happy Birthday, Stanley! [kicks cake onto Michael]  				",5,1,63
Dwight,  Attention!  Attention!  We only have a few weeks left.  [looking at Phyllis]  And most of you are just as fat as the day we began.,5,1,63
Dwight,"  This is what I’m gonna do.  I’m gonna randomly select three names and these three people will get liposuction.  Uhhhhh Stanley, Phyllis, Kevin.  And you will be responsible for your own medical bills.  				",5,1,63
Dwight,  Hello Phyllis.  Do you have a minute?  Listen.  I’m really sorry… about what I said before.  Ok?  I was way out of line.,5,1,63
Dwight,"  But you know what, I want to make it up to you.  There is a sure fire sale, but it’s a two man job.  Interested?",5,1,63
Dwight,  [sighs] Sixty – forty.  Hm? [they shake hands]  I’ll drive.  				,5,1,63
Dwight,"  And you burned over a thousand calories walking home.  And this branch just got a little bit closer to winning the contest.  Phyllis Vance, ladies and gentlemen! [claps]",5,1,63
Dwight,"  Yeah, I took your purse.  What are you worried about?  [Phyllis storms to her desk, picks up phone and dials]  You look great.  I can definitely see the difference. ",5,1,63
Dwight,"  No, no, no, it goes, it goes… look, “I say, I say, I say, I’ll sit on you!”",5,1,63
Dwight,  [exhales] I apologize for creating a ruse which forced you to exercise. ,5,1,63
Dwight,  I’m gonna write you both up for not working.,5,1,63
Dwight,"  Ok, well played.  Neither of us’ll write the other up for not working.",5,1,63
Dwight,  [sprays the inside of the vending machine with bug spray]  				,5,1,63
Dwight,  What are you smiling about there smiley pants?  You’re late.,5,1,63
Dwight," [raises hand] She’s not a virgin, you know.",5,2,64
Dwight," [trying to assist Michael, who is trying to press play on a CD player] I got it, I got it. [Olivia Newton-John’s “Let’s Get Physical” starts to play as Holly and Michael jog into the meeting room, dancing]",5,2,64
Dwight, What should we be working on while you guys are talking?,5,2,64
Dwight," It’s a trick question.  The bread is poisoned.  Also, it’s not your real family.  You’ve been cuckolded by a stronger, smarter male. ",5,2,64
Dwight," Oh, so wait a minute, you’re going to time me every time I yawn?  That’s absurd. [Jim smiles and starts the stopwatch] Really? [in a mocking voice] Oh hey look, monkey knows how to use a stopwatch everybody!  He’s ti— [Dwight conceeds and goes back to work, Jim stops the watch]",5,2,64
Dwight, There is no way that that was— [Jim starts the watch],5,2,64
Dwight," Ok. [Dwight turns around, but Jim holds up the stopwatch, threatening to start it]",5,2,64
Dwight," [Dwight stares at Angela, buttoning the top button of her blouse] Fine.",5,2,64
Dwight," Yes, maybe I’m not. [Dwight grins and gives a sly look at the camera]  				",5,2,64
Dwight, Contractions are coming every ten minutes.,5,3,65
Dwight, Aaaaaaaa! What do you do? What do you do?,5,3,65
Dwight," No, Gibson is covered in potholes.  Your car breaks down. Adapt!",5,3,65
Dwight, It’s about adapting to the circumstances.,5,3,65
Dwight," No. OK, no.  I’m crowning!  I’m crowning!  Aaaaaaaa! [runs into Michael’s office]",5,3,65
Dwight," Babies are one of my many areas of expertise.  Growing up, I performed my own circumcision.  				",5,3,65
Dwight," I’m screaming, I’m screaming, I’m screaming! Aaaaaaaa!",5,3,65
Dwight," OK!  When the baby emerges, mark it secretly in a kind of a mark that only you could recognize and no baby snatcher can ever copy.",5,3,65
Dwight, Oh no… [Michael enters and notices Jan’s baby]  				,5,3,65
Dwight, Jan had the baby and Michael wasn’t there to mark it.  So the baby could be anybody’s.  Except Michael’s.  				,5,3,65
Dwight, Huh. Twelve hundred dollars for a stroller? Phhhbt.,5,3,65
Dwight," Twelve hundred dollars is what I spent on my whole bomb shelter.  For that kind of money, this stroller should be indestructible. [straps the watermelon into the stroller on the elevator]  				",5,3,65
Dwight," [heaving the stroller into a tire yard] Don’t hit the fence.  Oh no, my child!  				",5,3,65
Dwight, [throwing the stroller against a high chain link fence] Don’t get stuck on the barbed wire!  				,5,3,65
Dwight, [tossing the stroller off a tall heap of tires] Playtime is over!  				,5,3,65
Dwight, I like to call this… the bumper test. [drags the stroller behind his car and runs into it several times]  				,5,3,65
Dwight, Oh.  I took the liberty of putting it in your trunk.,5,3,65
Dwight," I know none of that. If I did, you’d be the last to know.  				",5,4,66
Dwight," She introduced me to so many things. Pasteurized milk, sheets, monotheism, presents on your birthday, preventative medicine.",5,4,66
Dwight," Bravo, Watson. Looks like a classic seven-man job. Okay, security tapes were stolen, Motives-financial, or possible, vintage HP computer collectors. Hank down at security had clocked out. And that’s all we have.",5,4,66
Dwight," I know she loves me, Phyllis. I am sure of it. She practically told me so.",5,4,66
Dwight," Wait, this isn’t our floor. Dwight…  				",5,4,66
Dwight," Listen to me close. ‘Cause I’m only gonna say this once. You either break off your engagement with that singing buffoon, apologize, and then date me, or you can say good-bye to this. [points below his belt]",5,4,66
Dwight, I said I was only gonna say this once. You have until 6:14 PM. 6:14!,5,4,66
Dwight," Hey Phyllis, someone let the air out of your tires. Come quick.",5,4,66
Dwight, I had to get your attention. This is an emergency. [the air is let out of one of Phyllis’ tires],5,4,66
Dwight," Listen, she ignored my ultimatum. Now what?",5,4,66
Dwight," Okay, fine. I’ve moved on. Now how do I get her back?",5,4,66
Dwight," Wait, that’s it? That’s your advice? I thought you had some kind of big master plan.",5,4,66
Dwight, Oh. I get it. You’re trying to secure your place as head of the party-planning committee. You’re just being selfish. [Phyllis slaps Dwight] And you slap like a girl.  				,5,4,66
Dwight, What did Phyllis do wrong? I’ll tell you what Phyllis did wrong. She stuck her nose into my business and tried to help me. [Dwight has an epiphany]  				,5,4,66
Dwight," [dressed as the Joker] Hm mm mm mm. Want to see a magic trick? Heh heh heh! I’m gonna make a pencil disapp– oh! [elevator doors close, reopen.] Disappear.  				",5,5,67
Dwight, Thought I’d go casual today. Morning everyone. Good morning.  Hello.  How are you Phyllis?,5,5,67
Dwight," No I get it. I totally understand. And uh, I just want to assure you, that I mean no disrespect. You see, I’m applying!",5,5,67
Dwight," Well if somebody who barely out-sells Phyllis, can get in, I should be fine.",5,5,67
Dwight," I meant that as a compliment to you Phyllis, as well as a slight to Andy.  				",5,5,67
Dwight," Cornell is a good school, and I want to better myself through higher education. If it makes Andy angry, so be it. [He sips from his Cornell mug]  				",5,5,67
Dwight," Hey there. So uh, how do you think we’re gonna do against Penn this year? Nathan Ford’s arm looks pretty strong.",5,5,67
Dwight," Not so. Cornell is an excellent school. Without its agricultural program, we probably wouldn’t have cabbage. At least not modern cabbage.",5,5,67
Dwight," Someday, we’ll both get together in Comstock Hall and just laugh about all of this.  				",5,5,67
Dwight,"  Andy, let’s just talk about this man-to-man, after work.",5,5,67
Dwight," Andy, I’ve been meaning to ask you, which a cappella group should I join? The Harmoniacs, or the Do-Re-Mi-Go’s?",5,5,67
Dwight," Hmm, interviewing skills, sub-par. [writes in a notebook]",5,5,67
Dwight," On the contrary, I’m helping Cornell. By evaluating their interviewers.",5,5,67
Dwight," Well, when they get my evaluation we’ll see if they’re interested.",5,5,67
Dwight, “Interviewer is threatening applicant with an arbitrary review process.”,5,5,67
Dwight," “Interviewer has turned off applicant’s interest in Cornell, and they are going to go to the vastly superior Dartmouth.” Ever heard of it? I think I have everything I need.",5,5,67
Dwight, And you will not be pleased with the result. [pulls table away from Andy],5,5,67
Dwight," [has won the table war] That is all sir, you may go.  				",5,5,67
Dwight, I see what you are doing. But I do not know where you are going with this.,5,5,67
Dwight, [scoffs] Cornell. [easily bites into a beet]  				,5,5,67
Dwight," Oh, nothing can hurt you now. You’re a man in love!  ",5,6,68
Dwight, Bring it on. [starts to put foot up on Michael’s desk],5,6,68
Dwight, I sell more paper than anyone. [stands and reaches for the file],5,6,68
Dwight," Wait, is this a joke? I’m getting that queasy feeling that sometimes accompanies jokes.",5,6,68
Dwight," Those can’t be my scores, Jim. For your information —",5,6,68
Dwight, And I’m going to find that person and punish them.,5,6,68
Dwight," I’ve caught Jim talking to himself several times today. What a loser. Get a friend, loser.  ",5,6,68
Dwight," All right, fine. [picks up phone] Brrring.",5,6,68
Dwight," Hello, this is Dwight Schrute from the Dunder Mifflin Paper Company.",5,6,68
Dwight," Excellent, then you are in luck, because we are having a limited-time offer only on everything.",5,6,68
Dwight," Sorry, Mr. Buttlicker. As I was saying, we’re having a limited–",5,6,68
Dwight," OK, as I was saying, right now we are having —",5,6,68
Dwight, [shouting] Buttlicker! Our prices have never been lower!,5,6,68
Dwight, Please give me another chance. Mr. Buttlicker.,5,6,68
Dwight, Get in! [he peels off into parking space],5,6,68
Dwight," Shh. [turns radio up loud, playing “Centerfold.”] They might be listening to us.",5,6,68
Dwight, You never know. Better safe than sorry.,5,6,68
Dwight, Who stands to benefit from our downfall?,5,6,68
Dwight," Could be the mob. But then Dunder-Mifflin would need to be a front for money laundering, and there’s little evidence of that.",5,6,68
Dwight," I don’t know. Two, maybe three if one wears out. How many shoes do you need?  ",5,6,68
Dwight," Well, stop. Hold your breath. I still hear it. Who’s there? Kelly, is that you? Hold on. [puts down phone and runs away]",5,6,68
Dwight, [jumps into Kelly’s area] Ha! [Kelly screams in surprise],5,6,68
Dwight," What are you up to, girl? Huh? Phyllis put you up to this? Stanley? Are they paying you?",5,6,68
Dwight," Of course I am. I know you’re the mastermind, but you’re too stupid to do it by yourself.",5,6,68
Dwight," The reason that I got bad customer reviews is because I didn’t! There is a massive conspiracy going on here, and I know you’re involved.",5,6,68
Dwight, No. [holds Sheriff’s Department mug protectively],5,6,68
Dwight, No. Why? No. [puts it in desk drawer and slams it shut],5,6,68
Dwight," Oh, man, I knew it. Who are her co-conspirators?",5,6,68
Dwight," I knew it the whole time, buddy! [shoves Jim]",5,6,68
Dwight, I knew it! Yeah! Ha-ha! Woo! [kicks near Phyllis’ head; she ducks] Boom! Kelly the whole time. Let’s get her.,5,6,68
Dwight," Let me paint you a picture of a little girl from southern India, who despite being welcomed into this country will now spend the rest of her life in prison for a crime she did commit.",5,6,68
Dwight," Oh, come on. You juked the stats, cupcake.",5,6,68
Dwight, We have our confession. I’m calling security. [reaches for phone],5,6,68
Dwight, I want to be here when you fire her ass.,5,6,68
Dwight, Is that the Matsuhashi B-400? The world’s tiniest Bluetooth? [reaches toward Jim’s ear] May I?,5,6,68
Dwight, Congratulations on choosing Schrute Farms for your wedding.,5,6,68
Dwight," Well, then. Why don’t you look over some of our materials? [opens album]",5,6,68
Dwight," [looking at Angela] While I describe to you the Excalibur package. In addition to the breathtaking natural beauty and smell of Schrute Farms, I can promise you that our grounds can be catered to fit your exact specifications. [Angela smiles] I will work tirelessly for you over the coming months and be at your constant disposal. [Andy moves his head into Dwight’s view] Please feel free to call or stop by, any time of the day or night.",5,6,68
Dwight," While you, my good friend, have nothing more to worry about. This wedding is officially out of your hands.",5,6,68
Dwight," No, no, no, no, no.  You want to wear that puppy right up on the breastbone like a bra. [demonstrates]",5,7,69
Dwight," Here, let me help you. [reaches for Michael’s money belt]",5,7,69
Dwight, Do you want to get robbed in a foreign country? I wash my hands of this.,5,7,69
Dwight, [sighs and picks up Michael’s empty suitcases]  				,5,7,69
Dwight," Have you seen her painting, Jim? The building? There are shadows coming from two different directions.",5,7,69
Dwight," Last I checked, that’s not an office building in the Andromeda galaxy.",5,7,69
Dwight, It’s totally unrealistic.  There are no lines in the parking lot.  				,5,7,69
Dwight, Good. I need you to make five copies of these. [hands Pam papers],5,7,69
Dwight, Alright. First thing in the morning then.,5,7,69
Dwight," Brownies is it? Hm. Pastry cubes made of sugar and fat? No thank you, I’ll stick with my jerkie.",5,8,70
Dwight, I love catching people in the act.  That’s why I always whip open doors.,5,8,70
Dwight, Okay [stands up removes jacket and starts loosening his tie],5,8,70
Dwight," Oh, it’s a good day too. I’m wearing my mustard shirt.",5,8,70
Dwight, I hope he doesn’t haul off and just hit you.,5,8,70
Dwight, Punch him as hard as you possibly can in the face.,5,8,70
Dwight, I thought you were going to parcel those out through the day,5,8,70
Dwight, There’s still one thing we could do to get Toby fired.,5,8,70
Dwight," [goes over and closes office door] Frame him, for using drugs. ",5,8,70
Dwight," Yeah, it’s illegal, but… everything they do on The Shield is illegal.",5,8,70
Dwight, Oh I’ve framed animals before.  I framed a raccoon for opening a Christmas present.  And I framed a bear for eating out of the garbage.,5,8,70
Dwight," [on a cell phone in the hallway] Yes, I repeat a drug dealer is on the premisis of Dunder Mifflin.  His name is Toby Flenderson [Michael opens Toby’s desk drawer and puts something in it] and he recently returned from a mysterious vacation in Central America.   I have risked a great deal to tell you this information.  My name is Andy Bernard.  Andrew Bernard, that’s my name.  See you soon.  				",5,8,70
Dwight," Hey, Pam. Hey I got this, okay?  Hello, officers, Dwight Schrute, former volunteer Sheriff’s Deputy.  Listen, I may have inside information that someone is hiding drugs in this very office.  [leads them back towards the annex as Creed stands up and starts to put him hands up and then relaxes them behind his ears]  				",5,8,70
Dwight," Officers, I reveal to you the perpetrator.",5,8,70
Dwight," They don’t need your permission, Flenderson, they’ve got the company’s permission.",5,8,70
Dwight," Save your whining for the jury there, Flenderson.",5,8,70
Dwight," Gahh, dammit! [punches file cabinet] Come on!",5,8,70
Dwight," Wait, officers, are you sure you don’t want to interrogate him?",5,8,70
Dwight, [following them out] You have laws that protect you in any kind of interrogation.  Why don’t you use them?,5,8,70
Dwight," What is my perfect crime?  I break into Tiffany’s at midnight.  Do I go for the vault? No, I go for the chandelier.  It’s priceless.  As I’m taking it down, a woman catches me.  She tells me to stop.  It’s her father’s business.  She’s Tiffany.  I say no.  We make love all night.  In the morning the cops come and I escape in one of their uniforms.  I tell her to meet me in Mexico but I go to Canada.  I don’t trust her.  Besides, I like the cold.  Thirty years later, I get a postcard.  I have a son and he’s the chief of police.  This is where the story gets interesting:",5,8,70
Dwight," We’ll dig a trench. As long as it’s downhill from the well, we should be fine.",5,9,71
Dwight," Well we’re not gonna put out stumps, come on.",5,9,71
Dwight, This is where you’ll have your receiving line. Of course we’ll clear out all the livestock and hay and such.,5,9,71
Dwight, Manure covers up the small of the slaughterhouse.,5,9,71
Dwight, Have you made a decision on the butter sculpture?,5,9,71
Dwight," Okay. Cow, goat or sheep. It’s not that hard.",5,9,71
Dwight," So… why don’t we try this out, we’ll see what would happen. Give it a little test drive, what do you say? You pretend to be Angela’s father, you will play Angela, and uh, I will pretend to be you. That way you can see what it looks like when you’re up here.",5,9,71
Dwight, He doesn’t understand a word you’re saying.,5,9,71
Dwight," Although born just minutes from here, he speaks only German. Closed society. So, now, after the readings by all of your sisters, we will arrive at the vows. So, Konrad… [speaks German to minister; minister begins speaking in German] And away we go. This is a little taste of the ceremony, if you will. He’s explaining why we’re here, what we’re doing here, making introductions, blah blah blah… Then he’s gonna have Andy repeat a bunch of stuff. He’s gonna ask Andy to produce a ring. I have uh, now just uh… just some twine for our purposes, and you will put the ring on her finger. Yadda yadda, then he’s going to ask Andy, uh, if he would like to marry Angela. And you will reply, “I do.” [Andy mouths, “I do” silently] And then he’s going to ask Angela if she would like to marry Andy, to which you will reply…",5,9,71
Dwight," And there we go. Okay, and that’s just about it. Man and wife.  				",5,9,71
Dwight, I know you did. And that’s why I have taken care of everything.,5,9,71
Dwight," Well Monkey, he’s a real minister. And you said, “I do.” And I said, “I do.” And Andy wasn’t signing a receipt; he was signing our marriage certificate as a witness.",5,9,71
Dwight, My… It’s not my fault you don’t understand German; I’ve been telling you to take it for years!,5,9,71
Dwight, You’re so pathetic.  How long did this take you? Three hours?,5,10,72
Dwight,"  Yeah, no such thing.  They don’t give out black belts for things that are stupid. [scoffs]  Well, I hope it was worth it, cause I’m gonna take it apart in about five minutes.",5,10,72
Dwight," Really? If I can skin a mule deer in less than ten minutes, I ought to be able to cut my — [sets briefcase on desk and sits in chair, desk and chair are made of paper, Dwight crashes to the floor]  				",5,10,72
Dwight," These are not dolls, Jim.  These are commodities.  Same as gold or oil.    				",5,10,72
Dwight,"  Every year I do research to determine which toy will be the most popular of the Christmas season.  This year it’s a doll. Half girl, half unicorn.  Catchphrase: “My horn can pierce the sky”.  Pathetic. I bought out every store in the area over the last couple of weeks.  And as lazy parents become desperate I will sell them for an enormous profit.  Isn’t that right princess? [makes doll nod]  				",5,10,72
Dwight, I am simply punishing those parents that would wait till the last minute to get their child a gift.  And such a genetically improbable one.  Look at that.  How does that happen?  King has sex with a unicorn?  Man with a horn has sex with a royal horse?,5,10,72
Dwight, We got a live one!  On fire!! [Dwight extinguishes Meredith]  				,5,10,72
Dwight,"  Actually, I don’t care for Meredith, but I don’t believe in this kind of thing.  In the Schrute family we believe in a five fingered intervention. [holds up his fist] Awareness, education, control, acceptance and punching.  				",5,10,72
Dwight, I stab her in the brain with a wooden stick.  				,5,10,72
Dwight," There are several ways to kill a zombie, but the most satisfying one is to stab it in the brain with a wooden stick.  				",5,10,72
Dwight, She is a hazard to the other people of the office.,5,10,72
Dwight, I suppose I could do it if it was a controlled burn in a well ventilated area.,5,10,72
Dwight," Oh right, that’ll take a couple of weeks.",5,10,72
Dwight, [yelling as he runs past the radar gun] Aah!,5,11,73
Dwight, No. You can’t do that. It shouldn’t come from you.,5,11,73
Dwight, [coolly] Seems like you already know where.  				,5,11,73
Dwight, [whispering to Jim] Trade seats with me.,5,11,73
Dwight, I’ve got a better angle on Pam. I can see everything.,5,11,73
Dwight, [grabs a spoon from Jim’s coffee cup and checks behind him with it] I need a soup spoon.  				,5,11,73
Dwight, [moves his bobblehead from one side of his nameplate to the other and clears his throat to get Angela’s attention]  				,5,11,73
Dwight, Get it over with. Then we don’t have to hide anymore.,5,11,73
Dwight, Angela said she was going to tell him. She’s just not ready.,5,11,73
Dwight," Michael, once this gets out… I don’t know how it’s going to go down.",5,11,73
Dwight," [to Michael, who opens the door to leave] Have a good trip.",5,11,73
Dwight," If I’m sitting, I can’t disable his neck or his groin.",5,11,73
Dwight," If I’m sitting, I don’t have the option to.",5,11,73
Dwight," [angrier] Well I don’t know about that, because she certainly seems to enjoy making lovemaking with me.",5,11,73
Dwight, And I’m telling you that I will never back down.,5,11,73
Dwight," That is very general, and does not scare me in the slightest.",5,11,73
Dwight," Okay, fine! Good! A duel! The winner gets Angela.",5,11,73
Dwight, None of your business then. [Dwight and Andy high five] Good. So what weapon?,5,11,73
Dwight, That is stupid. I will use a sword and I will cut off your bare hands.,5,11,73
Dwight, I will also be talking my break at the exact same time and in the same location.,5,11,73
Dwight, [shouting] Come on! Where are you? Let’s do this thing! Come on! Come on out!,5,11,73
Dwight," Come on, coward! Where are you? Where… [spots a note attached to the bushes; goes to read it] “From the desk of Andrew Bernard.” [scoffs] A note. Pathetic. “Dear Dwight, by now you have received my note. How are you? I am well. You are no doubt wondering why I have left this note. It has come to my attention that in any physical match with you, I would surely be bested.” True. “The soft underbelly of my refined upbringing is my soft underbelly…” [as Dwight continues to read, Andy drives around the corner very slowly]  				",5,11,73
Dwight," [still reading] Alas, after much consideration and deliberation…",5,11,73
Dwight, Never! [hits Andy’s car with his bike chain] Get out and face me like a man!,5,11,73
Dwight, You’re not a man! You don’t know how to take care of her! [hits his car with the bike chain] All you do is dress fancy and sing. [imitating Andy] “La la la la la la la la la la!” What does that mean? You can’t even protect her!,5,11,73
Dwight," Last year, idiot! [hits his car with the bike chain]",5,11,73
Dwight, No. My right one’s falling asleep a little bit.,5,11,73
Dwight," Yeah, back off. This isn’t your fight. Oh, how much is this gonna cost? [hits his car with the bike chain] Oh! What? Trust fund will take care of that! [hits his car with the bike chain]",5,11,73
Dwight," Sasquatches are the strongest animal on the planet! So fine, call me a Sasquatch!",5,11,73
Dwight, She said she was only sleeping with me.  				,5,11,73
Dwight, [picks up his bobblehead and throws it in the trash can],5,11,73
Dwight," [as Jim is collecting weapons, runs to the couch near reception and pulls out a crossbow; Jim catches him and he hands it over]  				",5,11,73
Dwight," No, it’s going in a different direction then the other wires. ",5,12,74
Dwight, [riding in car with Michael] What if the owner of Prince Family Paper has a beautiful daughter and we have to seduce her in order to get their secrets?,5,12,74
Dwight, I am a paper salesman looking for a new job. I find out everything about their expenses and salaries.,5,12,74
Dwight, No because their sign is centered perfectly above their store. No sign of the sign being moved.,5,12,74
Dwight," [spying through binoculars] Its lunch time, and no sign of anyone coming in or out. Which means they are not taking new customers out to lunch.",5,12,74
Dwight, Which Means they’re not acquiring new business. So once again no growth.,5,12,74
Dwight," Oh, it would if they were all cumulous and not cirrostratus.",5,12,74
Dwight," So you go in now, I am going to go in exactly ten minutes. We have never met each other. We are complete strangers. Also, we are going to need a signal to bolt out of there if there is danger. Lick ur lips, try it. [Michael licks lips] No, no like this. [Dwight starts and Michael follows passionately licking their lips] Good. ",5,12,74
Dwight," Hello, I would like to apply for a job. ",5,12,74
Dwight, Why don’t you just get rid of this guy? [points to Prince Son],5,12,74
Dwight," I’m your son now; you can visit him on holidays. Dwight Schrute, I’m a paper salesman at a second tier paper company called Dunder Mifflin.  I’m the top salesman there and I’m looking for a new challenge. I would say you guys have what, 40 high full volume clients?",5,12,74
Dwight," Pshaw, that’s nothing. I’ve 90 clients myself. You had better look out, someone might run you out of business.",5,12,74
Dwight," My boss, his insensitivity might border on cruel. This is a man who does not listen to the needs his underlings. [Michael takes offense and charges over]",5,12,74
Dwight," [both making make out lips at each other] Excuse me sir, I took the bus here and was wondering if I could catch a ride home with you in your car.",5,12,74
Dwight, Thank you for your time I look forward to getting your calls. [hurrying out door],5,12,74
Dwight, All their top clients I can’t believe it.,5,12,74
Dwight," Someone’s looking out the window. Go go, Peel out, go. [car hits front divider, screeching]",5,12,74
Dwight," You drove over that. Go back [car hits divider, screeching]",5,12,74
Dwight, You’ve done more then you can possibly know.,5,12,74
Dwight, He drove over the divider and then backed over it and caused the..,5,12,74
Dwight," This is disgusting, what is it this, instant?",5,12,74
Dwight, I look forward to hearing from you about that job application.,5,12,74
Dwight," Goodbye prince family, [to Michael] should be called the Sucker family. Here you go shark, let me fix your fin for you and sharpen your teeth while I’m at it. [Dwight laughs evilly, Michael seems remorseful] Bye bye.  ",5,12,74
Dwight," [punches Michael on the arm, beckons to Michael for high five, does not get it, high fives himself, smiles contently]  ",5,12,74
Dwight," Its simple, David would use that information to destroy them.",5,12,74
Dwight," It doesn’t make sense, of course I’m alive.",5,12,74
Dwight," Michael, you have to. Have you ever seen a lioness devour its cub? Have you ever seen a baboon devour its mate?  Have you ever seen a raccoon devour a squirrel?",5,12,74
Dwight," Your heart is a wonderful thing, Michael. But it has made some terrible decisions.",5,12,74
Dwight," Yeah, save your heart for love, and use your brain for business, right? If we don’t do this to prince paper, someone else will. Worse yet, someone else will do it to us.  ",5,12,74
Dwight," There was a terrible war, ugh, so many died. Far too many died. But if Frodo hadn’t destroyed the ring, then goodness itself might have died. ",5,12,74
Dwight," Good, so, [Michael takes client list and heads out of office] where are you going?",5,12,74
Dwight," Michael, Michael, no. Michael, give that. Michael, don’t do this. No. [chasing Michael out of the office into parking lot] ",5,12,74
Dwight," Freeze, give me the list! [still chasing him back into office where Michael grabs his car keys from his desk and heads back to parking lot]",5,12,74
Dwight," Its business, not personal. [they run back outside, where Dwight gets paper from Michael]",5,12,74
Dwight," Its over, Michael, its over. [holding list of clients up]",5,12,74
Dwight," Guess whose stock just went up, golden boy?",5,12,74
Dwight,"  Oh, fire!  Oh my goodness!  What’s the procedure?  What do we do, people?",5,13,75
Dwight," No, we don’t know that.  The smoke could be coming through an air duct.",5,13,75
Dwight," What’s the procedure, everyone? What’s the procedure?",5,13,75
Dwight," No! No, Michael! No!  Touch the handle.  If it’s hot, there could be a fire in the hallway.",5,13,75
Dwight, Oh! Here’s a door.  Check that one out. How’s the handle?,5,13,75
Dwight," Well, uh, another option. [everyone chattering at once] ",5,13,75
Dwight, Back to our options. Jeez! Ok! settle down everyone.  No bunching!,5,13,75
Dwight," Things can be replaced, Phyllis! People, human lives, however, can… ",5,13,75
Dwight," Okay! Procedure, procedure. Exit options.  Where do we go folks?  Wha– Use a what to cover the mouth?  ",5,13,75
Dwight," A what?  A rag.  A damp rag, perhaps.  Let’s remember those procedures.  What are the options?  Okay, that’s the wrong way.  We’ve already tried that.  Remember your exit points.  Exit points people.",5,13,75
Dwight," How about 911?  Anyone? 911. [Michael throws a chair at the window, Kevin smashes a chair through the vending machine and begins to grab snacks, everyone is shouting.]",5,13,75
Dwight, Use the surge of fear and adrenaline to sharpen your decision-making.,5,13,75
Dwight, [blowing air horn] Attention everyone! Employees of Dunder Mifflin!  This has been a test of our emergency preparedness.  There is no fire.  It was only a simulation.,5,13,75
Dwight," Fire not real.  This was merely a training exercise. [Oscar drops down from the ceiling] So, what have we learned? [Stanley falls to the floor]  Oh come on.  It’s not real Stanley. Don’t have a heart attack.",5,13,75
Dwight, A lot of ideas were not appreciated in their time.,5,13,75
Dwight," I just want to say for the record, I did not kill anyone.  Stanley was attacked by his own heart. And he should be released from the hospital and back in the office in a couple days. ",5,13,75
Dwight," Yes I shouted “fire!”.  I shouted many things! I also shouted instructions on how to get out of the building, so you can imagine my frustration as safety officer when nobody would heed of what– heeded–",5,13,75
Dwight, N-no one would take hedded of my instructions.,5,13,75
Dwight, Well… I guess we papered over that pretty nicely. [chuckles] It always amuses me when corporate thinks they can make some big change with a twenty minute meeting in some fancy high-rise. What’s the matter? You hungry?,5,13,75
Dwight, Don’t you worry about that.  I got it covered.  Okay?,5,13,75
Dwight, I am planning a bomb scare that should really get the blood pumping. ,5,13,75
Dwight, This is a farce. I should be teaching this course.,5,13,75
Dwight," Okay, he’s dead.  Anyone know what we do next? Anybody? Rose? ",5,13,75
Dwight,"  Wrong. Ehh. Check for an organ donor card.  If he has one, we only have minutes to harvest. ",5,13,75
Dwight, Get me some ice and a styrofoam bucket. [pulls out knife from holder that is attached to his leg] Here we go.,5,13,75
Dwight, We search for the organs. Where’s the heart? The precious heart.,5,13,75
Dwight," I didn’t think it was very realistic in the movie and it turns out, it’s pretty realistic.",5,13,75
Dwight," I could not, because I do not feel it. Okay, everyone. I am going to need you to sign this statement of regret as an acknowledgement that you heard it.  Okay? Everyone come on up here. It’s not a big deal.",5,13,75
Dwight," Yeah, right. I filled him full of butter and sugar for 50 years and forced him not to exercise. Now, take a lesson from Stanley and jog on up here and sign this, okay?  Make a line. Just form a line right here.  Sign it!  Sign it now!  				",5,13,75
Dwight, Nothing stresses me out. Except having to seek the approval of my inferiors.,5,13,75
Dwight, Speaking of which… [hands Michael the paper to sign for Dwight’s formal apology],5,13,75
Dwight," May I have your attention please? Sign in, sign in on the sign in sheet, the clipboard. This meeting is mandatory, if you do not sign in your name will not be counted. Thank you.",5,13,75
Dwight, How dare you all attack him like this. ,5,13,75
Dwight," Okay, you should be bowing down in front of him.",5,13,75
Dwight," Ok, no, they don’t understand who they have…",5,13,75
Dwight, You’re interrupting me. I’m trying to get your back.,5,13,75
Dwight," Don’t you ever talk to me that way. You pathetic, short little man. You don’t have any friends, or any family, or any land. [clapping and whooing]  				",5,13,75
Dwight," It’s very unusual for Michael not to show up to work. My guess? He’s either deeply depressed, or an icicle has snapped off his roof and impaled his brain. He has this terrible habit of standing directly underneath them and staring up at them. And I always say Michael, take two steps back, and stare at the icicle from the side. And he’s like no, I like the way they look from standing directly underneath them.  				",5,13,75
Dwight, Attention everyone I just got a text from Michael. He says personnel day. Are we hiring?,5,13,75
Dwight, [after snatching the clipboard with her signature] Got it.  				,5,13,75
Dwight," Excuse me, that is no way to address a superior.",5,14,76
Dwight, What he said was… [puts finger toward Jim’s face],5,14,76
Dwight," …there was a problem with having one head of the party planning committee. She becomes too powerful, so he appointed two heads.",5,14,76
Dwight," [at the same time as Jim] I am a paper salesman, this is humiliating. [shoves Jim’s arm away] That’s on my side.",5,14,76
Dwight, What kind of cake do you want imbecile.,5,14,76
Dwight, This is more professional. It’s not like she discovered a cure for cancer.,5,14,76
Dwight," Are you trying to hurt my feeling? Because if so, you are succeeding. Fortunately, my feelings regenerate at twice the speed of a normal man’s.",5,14,76
Dwight, Have you collected the money from everyone?,5,14,76
Dwight, [yelling] That’s how much you and I contributed! I… Damn it Jim!,5,14,76
Dwight, [struggling to blow up a balloon as his desk phone rings] Damn it! [answers phone] Dwight Schrute.,5,14,76
Dwight, Mose doesn’t know how to use a phone. So joke’s on you.,5,14,76
Dwight, [sighs] I’ll call you back. [goes to a filling cabinet takes out a file and looks around]  				,5,14,76
Dwight," I have here Kelly Kapoor’s personal and confidental file. Allow me to share. [opens file]  “Kelly Kapoor spent April 1995 to December 1996 at Berks County Youth Center.” Juvie. “According to past employers, it in no way affects her job perfor…”  Blah, Blah, Blah. [closes file]  				",5,14,76
Dwight, [shouts from another room] What did you do?,5,15,77
Dwight," What did you learn in there? I bet you learned things, huh? Like how to fashion a shiv, hmm?",5,15,77
Dwight, Why don’t you tell Jim where you were from ages 14 to 15.,5,15,77
Dwight, Juvie… nile… Detention Center. Where they send teenagers!,5,15,77
Dwight," Yeah, if she’s old enough to get married, she’s old enough to follow the law. [to Kelly] What did you do?",5,15,77
Dwight, I thought you said yesterday was your birthday!,5,15,77
Dwight," Oh, my God. Is this how you are with Pam? ‘Cause she must want to shoot herself in the face.",5,15,77
Dwight," [blowing up balloon, breathes loudly] You have to write my suggestions down, too.",5,15,77
Dwight," You’re right, forget horse hunting. It’s stupid.",5,15,77
Dwight," Here’s one. It was dark, warm, wet. A sudden burst of light. An intense pressure like I’d never felt before. Father, dressed in white, pulls me forward. Mother bites the cord. [pretends to bite]",5,15,77
Dwight," Schrutes don’t celebrate birthdays, idiot. It started as a Depression-era practicality, and then moved on to an awesome tradition that I look forward to every year. [rolls eyes] What about you?",5,15,77
Dwight," That’s cool. Hey, you know what’s even cooler than triceratops? Every other dinosaur that ever existed.",5,15,77
Dwight," [high-fives Jim] Oh, yes! Okay, good. So what’s it gonna be, Kapoor?",5,15,77
Dwight," Okay, nap it is! Everyone out! Get out! We’re gonna be eating cake at our desks. Let’s go. ",5,15,77
Dwight," Move it! Let’s go, go, go, go, go. I got this.",5,15,77
Dwight," [turns off lights] Okay, you’ve got one hour. [shuts door]",5,15,77
Dwight," [opens door to wake Kelly, bangs together two trash can covers loudly] Birthday time is over! Now go make up for all the work you missed when you were taking your nap. [slaps Kelly’s butt] Many happy returns. [slams door]  ",5,15,77
Dwight, How about now? [Dwight untenses his arm]  				,5,16,78
Dwight," I train my major blood vessels to retract into my body on command.  Also, I can retract my penis up into itself. [pauses, then nods signaling that he performed the feat]   				",5,16,78
Dwight," You’re right.  OK everyone,  back to work.",5,16,78
Dwight," Lonely people mixing with one another?  Breeding? Creating an even lonelier generation?  Ha, you’re not allowing natural selection to do its work.  Pssh.  You’re like the guy who invented the seat belt.  				",5,16,78
Dwight, I’m ok.  Feel a little lopsided because of all the blood they took out of my right side.,5,16,78
Dwight," Dwight K. Schrute. Why don’t you introduce me to your little friend? [Dwight immediately breaks the handshake with the redhead and turns to the blonde]  Hi, Dwight.",5,16,78
Dwight," I can untie any knot.  I’m serious.  Name a knot, any knot.  Go ahead.",5,16,78
Dwight," You shouldn’t believe everything you hear.  In fact, there are many knots that I cannot untie.  So where does a woman as charming as yourself find herself employed on a day such as today.",5,16,78
Dwight," …and the kind of discounts we’re talking about are not… hold on – Michael, Why do you keep looking at the front door?",5,16,78
Dwight," Oh, not likely.  3 billion woman on the planet, most of them live in Asia so the numbers just don’t add up.",5,16,78
Dwight," So basically, the greater volume you decide to buy in, the greater discount we can give you.",5,16,78
Dwight," Oh-oh-oh before you go, I’d just love to get a firm commitment on this.  You know maybe sign–",5,16,78
Dwight," OK.  Well, thanks for wasting my time tonight, idiot.  God!",5,16,78
Dwight," OK, Michael, please, please, please, please, please let me.",5,17,79
Dwight, [in Russian accent] We will ask the questions!,5,17,79
Dwight, C’mon. What are you doing? Mine was a part of my hilarious joke. ,5,17,79
Dwight," I’m not gonna answer it, it’s the KGB. [Jim slaps Dwight]",5,17,79
Dwight, You did. Several times. Over and over again. ,5,17,79
Dwight, [same time as Michael] You were dressed as Willy Wonka so… ,5,17,79
Dwight, Hold that thought. [Dwight gets up and gets own diary from desk and returns] [flipping through diary] March… 4th. Michael Scott came up with golden ticket idea to give five customers ten perfect off for one year. ,5,17,79
Dwight," I wasn’t given candy as a child, so a movie that fetish-ized it that much, would have made no sense to me. Plus, we weren’t allowed to see movies. So… do the math. ",5,17,79
Dwight, Had conversation with Michael about taking credit for an idea that wasn’t mine. Discussed movies. ,5,17,79
Dwight, No… How skin is the largest organ of the body. ,5,17,79
Dwight, I did fall on my sword once. I was running with it in my belt. Won’t happen again.   ,5,17,79
Dwight, I love working here and I do not want to leave. ,5,17,79
Dwight, We discussed the fact that I’m cooped up here instead of experiencing the whole wide world. ,5,17,79
Dwight, No plowing my own acres. Going around shirtless all day. You know experiencing freedom.,5,17,79
Dwight, I’m gonna go back to work. After I write you up for insubordination.,5,17,79
Dwight, David… you’re welcome. [Dwight and David shake hands and make exclamations]  ,5,17,79
Dwight, [same time as Michael] You never know when it’s gonna strike. Just… boom. ,5,17,79
Dwight, [same time as Michael] ‘Cause I’ve got this idea… ,5,17,79
Dwight," OK guys, listen up. Here’s the deal. I love candy. Sweet sugary candy from the second it touches my tongue to the moment it’s metabolized by my stomach acids, so naturally I liked Willy Wonka. ",5,17,79
Dwight, So I love Willy Wonka. That golden ticket scene is so inspiring to me that that’s where I cam up with that idea [Michael comes into conference room].,5,17,79
Dwight, It is my idea. I’m filled with good ideas. Thousands of good ideas.,5,17,79
Dwight, A canoe built around your horse so you can go from riding to water travel without slowing down. Horse Boat!,5,17,79
Dwight, [same time as Michael] Women’s urinals… uh… ,5,17,79
Dwight," Yes, it’s Michael’s idea that he forced on me on threat of death. ",5,17,79
Dwight, No! [Michael struggles to take Dwight’s diary from his hand]  ,5,17,79
Dwight," [in accent] When you are done, open the door. … Hello in there?",5,17,79
Dwight, We will come back at… how is [looks at watch] 4:45?,5,17,79
Dwight," [walking on Pam’s desk, then Jim’s desk] Extreme! Parkour!",6,1,81
Dwight," [stands on his hands kicking open bathroom doors as Andy films, Meredith is seen applying deodorant in women’s bathroom]",6,1,81
Dwight, Andy! Leapfrog! [Andy leapfrogs Dwight],6,1,81
Dwight," Yeah! [Dwight jumps on Andy’s back, riding him like a horse] Parkour! Parkour!",6,1,81
Dwight," [crouching beside car] Jump over the camera! Jump over the camera! [Michael feebly attempts to jump off car, gives double thumbs up to camera]",6,1,81
Dwight, [on telephone] Good. Excellent. Thank you.,6,1,81
Dwight," [chugs water, throws away cup] Yes. Umm… see those files behind Kevin’s desk?",6,1,81
Dwight, Then come back here for your next assignment concerning their order.  				,6,1,81
Dwight," [typing] Okay, let me finish this thought.",6,1,81
Dwight, [still typing] He most definitely does. He’s been asking her out repeatedly for weeks. She finally said yes. They went out on a group date the other night; apparently it went very well.,6,1,81
Dwight," [still typing] People tell me things. I guess I have a face you can trust. I think it’s because of my low cheekbones. And… boom. [finishes typing, turns to face Michael] Okay, what is it, what can’t I guess?  				",6,1,81
Dwight, Stanley’s way past the middle of his life. Especially considering his height to weight ratio.,6,1,81
Dwight," [giving envelopes to interns] Present these to the dean for credit. And, as a gift, I’ve attached my card. Call me any time of the day or night.",6,1,81
Dwight," [grabs card from Eric, crumples it, throws it to the ground] Well now you can’t call me at all. Problem solved.",6,1,81
Dwight," Look at the intern to your left. Now to your right. [interns do nothing] One of you will do exceedingly well in business, just unlimited potential. One of you will make a living, and nothing more. And one of you [looks directly at Megan] will make a great mother. It’s up to you to choose which you want to be.  				",6,1,81
Dwight," Michael… [leads Michael to corner of vestibule, then whispers] You told people I use store-bought manure, when I showed you where my manure comes from. Hmm? Hmm? [Michael looks nervously to camera as elevator doors open]",6,1,81
Dwight,"   Hmmm, interesting.  How did the ladder end up on top of you, if you fell off of it?  ",6,2,82
Dwight,"   Oh really, I’m sorry I thought this was a free country.  I didn’t know we were in communist Sweden.  ",6,2,82
Dwight,"   So long Darryl, feel better… [to Toby] He’s lying.",6,2,82
Dwight,"   Oh? From who, Dr. J?  Look, you really need to investigate this.  People don’t just fall off of ladders.  ",6,2,82
Dwight,   Since when have you known Darryl to rush to do anything other than to come up here for birthday cake?  [imitating Darryl]  Y’all having birthday cake?  ,6,2,82
Dwight,   Please… and how many foremen do you know that pull boxes?  ,6,2,82
Dwight,"   Nah, that’s a GE. A P40 is much higher pitched.  ",6,2,82
Dwight,   I’m rebuilding a turn of the century steam engine in my slaughter house.  ,6,2,82
Dwight,"   Yeah, it’s just a run of the mill slaughter house, but sure anytime.",6,2,82
Dwight,"   Here, get down! He’s not using crutches!  Get the camera!  ",6,2,82
Dwight,   Ooohhh… [crashes car into garbage cans]  Oh man!  You okay?  ,6,2,82
Dwight,   I need to see your pupils.   I need to see if they’re dilated.  ,6,2,82
Dwight,   Are you… are you serious?  Be… cause you look exactly alike.  Am I the only one?  Are you getting this?,6,2,82
Dwight,   Wait!  They’re using the lift as their own personal elevator.,6,2,82
Dwight,"   He broke his ankle climbing over the railing and he lied about it because it was a misuse of company equipment, case closed.  ",6,2,82
Dwight,   Really?  Then why is there new wood only on one railing?  Hmmm?   We should check the security tapes Toby.  ,6,2,82
Dwight,"   Now, I would like to file an official complaint to corporate because Darryl lied on an official form.  ",6,2,82
Dwight,   Phhhht.  No judge is gonna believe that… ,6,2,82
Dwight,"   Okay people,  listen up, I have an announcement to make, fraud was committed… ",6,2,82
Dwight, [in Michael’s office] I have a complaint about Jim.,6,3,83
Dwight," I would like to file a huge, enormous, massive complaint about the tallest guy in our office.",6,3,83
Dwight, [in Jim’s office] I’d like to lodge a complaint.,6,3,83
Dwight," Wait, stop writing that. That is not true.",6,3,83
Dwight," I deserved that promotion, not Jim. Oh, man. Makes me want to put him in a triangle choke hold and force him down to the ground and just keep pressing and pressing. And then flip him over and then put him in a hammer lock! And he’s gasping, he’s panting! Every last breath! And the crowd is going crazy. And boom! I emerge victorious! [claps hands and stands up] Aha! $18,000 and a chance at the title! Ooh hah! ",6,3,83
Dwight, This is ridiculous! How could he do this to us?!,6,3,83
Dwight," What about all these people, huh?! How is it fair to them?!",6,3,83
Dwight," People are starting to notice how terrible Jim is. It’s great. Eventually, they’ll rise up and revolt. My only hope is that they do it sooner rather than later. If the people here were our founding fathers, the Revolutionary War would have been delayed ten years, because Stanley Washington was napping, and Phyllis Hancock was still signing the declaration, and Kevin Jefferson was distracted by a butterfly.   				",6,3,83
Dwight," Come on in. [everyone looking around at all the pictures and beans on the table]   That’s right. Come in, feast your eyes. They determine our worth by putting beans upon our faces.",6,3,83
Dwight, Things were not this bad when just Michael was manager. ,6,3,83
Dwight," Are we idiots? [gets up, starts walking around] What right does Jim have to claim authority, hmm? Is he as good a salesman as I? Is he as matronly as Phyllis? There are moments where we can affect change. For a few seconds every decade, we exist, and these are those seconds! Let us storm his castle! Come on! Tick– let’s get him. Tock– let’s get Jim! Tick– and drag Jim out of his office! Tock– take his keys away from him! Tick– that’s a clock! The time is getting very close! It’s now or never! What say you?!",6,3,83
Dwight," No, I mean, what do you say to my plan? [all groan] Okay.",6,3,83
Dwight, Pam is constantly throwing up because of the pregnancy. If she eats something the fetus doesn’t like she is screwed. It’s amazing. A three ounce fetus is calling the shots. It’s so bad ass.  				,6,4,84
Dwight," Oh, gee, I’m sorry. I guess I missed the meeting where we all all voted for you to get pregnant. No! I reserve the right to peel my hard-boiled eggs at my desk.",6,4,84
Dwight," What happens in accounting, stays in accounting.",6,4,84
Dwight, I stole the guest list from Jim’s desk and I search engined every female on both sides of the family.,6,4,84
Dwight," For instance, Pam’s cousin, Jocelyn Webster.",6,4,84
Dwight, Two years ago she was selling a mountain bike.,6,4,84
Dwight, Well… she was really into mountain biking but not so much lately.,6,4,84
Dwight," She had a couple hundred dollars to spend, I mean, if she was able to sell her bike.",6,4,84
Dwight," Well, if this is in fact her because it is a very common name.",6,4,84
Dwight, This is to play when you bring a woman back to your hotel room.,6,4,84
Dwight," You’re gonna like this. [Dwight’s voice on the cd] “Hello. This is Dwight Schrute. If you are listening to this you are a lucky woman Michael has seduced. Ah to be in your shoes. ‘What’s next?’, you’re probably wondering. Don’t be scared of you’re night in heaven–” [Michael turns off cd]",6,4,84
Dwight, The proximity to the falls makes everything smell like a basement.,6,4,84
Dwight, Dwight Schrute. I have a reservation. Confirmation number: Romeo. Tango. G7745.,6,4,84
Dwight, And I had spoken to Teresa about a room with two safes?,6,4,84
Dwight," Wait a second. Oh. No, no, no. This must be some kind of mistake. This reservation seems to be under an M. Scott. This must be yours.",6,4,84
Dwight," Oh no. Now that I don’t have a room, can I stay with you?",6,4,84
Dwight, Ok. Ok. A-ha-ha! [rips reservation out of Michael’s hand] That was a test. You have failed. For this is my room. You would not share with me.,6,4,84
Dwight," From quarter three to quarter four up 17 percent, while his sales down two percent. It’s all in the report.",6,4,84
Dwight," Excellent question. Because while I was busy trying to improve the company and make it a success, Jim… the bad man was busy kissing the boss man’s butt.",6,4,84
Dwight, That’s right. It is ew. It is very ew.  				,6,4,84
Dwight," Isabel Poreba. Oh, I’ve got stuff on her. [laughs] In 1996 her tenth grade volleyball team went 10-2.",6,4,84
Dwight, No. They’re howling at the moon. It’s suggestive to women because of the howling during sex.,6,4,84
Dwight," I’m just worried about the farm, ya know? Mose hates to geld the horses by himself.",6,4,84
Dwight," I invented a device called ‘Burger on the Go’. It allows you to obtain 6 regular size hamburgers, or 12 sliders, from a horse without killing the animal. George Foreman is still considering it. Sharper Image is still considering it. Sky Mall’s considering it. Hammacher Schlemer is still considering it. Sears said, ‘No’.  				",6,4,84
Dwight, “Jim… hey why don’t you braid my hair.  I want to watch TV.”,6,4,84
Dwight,  [walking out of hotel room with a woman] You have everything?,6,4,84
Dwight,"  It really is.  I’m not hungry.  I ate a whole bunch of sunflower seeds after you went to sleep.  And besides, I wouldn’t want to take you away from Pam on the morning of her wedding.  She needs you Isabel.  ",6,4,84
Dwight, [lays on bed] Really?  I hadn’t noticed.  Too busy knocking boots.    				,6,4,84
Dwight,  I’m ravenous after a night of love making.  You?,6,4,84
Dwight,  Brides side or grooms side?  Or townie?,6,4,84
Dwight," Isabel was nice, but I hope she doesn’t think this is going anywhere.  ",6,4,84
Dwight,  Look.  She’s a dental hygienist from Carbondale and she makes love like one.  She’s a bumpkin.  Pass.  ,6,4,84
Dwight,"  I got them a set of turtle boiling pots, a shell hammer and bibs.    				",6,4,84
Dwight,  [talking to a woman] That was an intelligent comment.  ,6,4,84
Dwight," Oh.  Fine.  Isabel, [holds out hand] nice to see you.  What do you want?  ",6,4,84
Dwight," [turns back to other woman] So, uh tell me again the difference between Filene’s and Filene’s basement.  ",6,4,84
Dwight,  I’d like to lodge a formal complaint against Jim for making us wait for over an hour.,6,4,84
Dwight," [looks over and sees hole in his present]  Crap.  [sees turtle on the ground, goes over and picks it up]  Come here you.",6,4,84
Dwight, I think you’re right. It definitely looks suspicious. And his southern Italian heritage raises some flags.,6,5,85
Dwight," I knew it! More trunk space. Or should I say, corpse space.",6,5,85
Dwight," No, not that, by itself. But look at all the facts. He seems like a mobster.",6,5,85
Dwight, No I disagree. “R” is among the most menacing of sounds. That’s why they call it “murder.” And not “muck-duck.”,6,5,85
Dwight, He’s right. Cops can’t do anything until a crime has been reported.,6,5,85
Dwight," No, criminals are like raccoons. Okay, you give ’em a taste of cat food pretty soon they’ll be back for the whole cat.",6,5,85
Dwight," The only way to defeat a bully is to stand up to him. Trust me, I have bullied a lot of people.",6,5,85
Dwight," Here’s what we do. We meet him in a public place. Ask him to lunch or something like that, some place he can’t be openly violent. ",6,5,85
Dwight, Let him know you’re not the typical kind of guy that he can shake down. That you’re stubborn. That you might even be a little bit dangerous.,6,5,85
Dwight, Hey. Bathroom checks out clean. Nothing behind the toilet except for this roach motel.,6,5,85
Dwight, You’ll never kill it that way. You want to separate the head from the thorax-,6,5,85
Dwight," What he’s trying to say is, Gabba. Gool.",6,5,85
Dwight, He was trying to force you to decide on a policy.,6,5,85
Dwight," I don’t understand, why would you buy a policy?",6,5,85
Dwight," It wasn’t a snap decision, you were sitting there for an hour.",6,5,85
Dwight, Do you know what “snap decision” means?,6,5,85
Dwight," We have let Michael down, and it’s 85 percent your fault.",6,5,85
Dwight," Not on the inside he’s not. Look at his life! Broke! Living in fear! No friends, dead end job.",6,5,85
Dwight, Yes. He’s got to stand up to this mafia guy.,6,5,85
Dwight, Me neither. Not the way things are now. But what if Michael felt no fear toward the mafia guy? ,6,5,85
Dwight, What is wrong with you? I am talking about convincing Michael that the guy’s not mafia!,6,5,85
Dwight,  Well more far-fetched than a mobster walking into a paper company for a low-level shakedown?  And that happened.  				,6,5,85
Dwight, Michael. Incredible news. Grotti is clean.,6,5,85
Dwight," It’s true, he’s clean. I have a couple of friends still on the force. Checked with them. Ran his Fed friend up the flagpole to make sure he wasn’t on the take. Turns out he’s a totally lovely guy. Sweetest guy on the force really.",6,5,85
Dwight," We just told you he wasn’t mafia, so you wouldn’t be scared.",6,5,85
Dwight, This conversation has two items on the agenda.,6,6,86
Dwight," Number one, do not leave your things on my desk. It’s not some kind of personal pen receptacle for you. I don’t care how high they promote you, which brings me to item number two… I never formally congratulated you on your promotion, so I’d just like to say… [high voice, holding up wooden mallard] con-quack-ulations!",6,6,86
Dwight," [duck voice] You’re welcome! [quacks, laughs]  				",6,6,86
Dwight," I inserted a listening device into the belly of the mallard. Now I can observe Jim, trap Jim, and destroy Jim, just like in the Bavarian fairy tale. Only this time, the mallard skins the toad alive. And of course in this version you lose the whole veiled critique of the Kaiser thing.   				",6,6,86
Dwight, I’m sorry to have been bugging you all these years. ,6,6,86
Dwight," Mallard. Okay, I’ll get out of your hair.   				",6,6,86
Dwight," [to Michael] You seem tense. Hey, you want me to give you the chills?",6,6,86
Dwight," There’s an egg on your head and the yolk is running down, the yolk is running down… ",6,6,86
Dwight, There’s a knife in your back and the blood is gushing down… ,6,6,86
Dwight," …the blood is gushing down, the blood is gushing down… You know, I really would have appreciated a heads-up that you were into dating mothers. I would have introduced you to mine.  				",6,6,86
Dwight, [Andy gets up and leaves the office] The Nard Dog… what was that all about?,6,6,86
Dwight,  What were you talking about in there?  ,6,6,86
Dwight,  Volunteerism is important.  Every weekend I volunteer at the local animal shelter and they need a lot of help down there.  Last Sunday I had to put down over 150 pets all by myself.,6,6,86
Dwight,  I don’t think there’s a whole lot of sleeping going on.  ,6,6,86
Dwight,  [Dwight storms through the break room listening to Kelly and Ryan in his ear piece] Shh!,6,6,86
Dwight,"  Okay, I gave that to him that as a gift, I’m taking that back.",6,6,86
Dwight,  [sighs heavily] I’ll give you five bucks for it.,6,6,86
Dwight,"  Well, I had to, I mean… Kelly was not even… ",6,6,86
Dwight,  [walks into Jim’s office and takes out ear piece] I’m sorry. ,6,6,86
Dwight,  Mallard.  I put it in your office in order to surveil you.  I was jealous that you got the promotion over me.  ,6,6,86
Dwight,"  Punishment fits the crime, I accept.  [shakes Jim’s hand and leaves]  				",6,6,86
Dwight," [walks into Jims office, twists the top of the pen that he placed in Jim’s pen holder which has a bug in it, pushes play] [Jim’s voice] “We have our high quality 28 pound bond, our heavier 38 pound bond, or our…” [pauses recording] I’ve got eight hours of this.  Of course I wanted Jim to find the mallard, make him feel safe.  Did you really think I would put my primary listening device in a wooden mallard?  I’m not insane. [starts the recording again] “…65 pound cover stock, which is the heaviest paper that will still feed smoothly through your desktop printer.”  				",6,6,86
Dwight," Michael, can I get you something? A towel? Some cocoa?",6,7,87
Dwight, A carp is both a fish and a term for complaing. They’re mocking you with wordplay.,6,7,87
Dwight," Michael, flounder is both a kind of fish and –",6,7,87
Dwight, I don’t want people making fun of my nose.,6,7,87
Dwight," Michael, please. Stop it now. You’re embarrassing yourself.",6,7,87
Dwight, Play it again. [everyone has the same reaction as before] He purposefully leaned away and let you fall in.,6,7,87
Dwight," Jim is my enemy. But it turns out that Jim is also his own worst enemy. And the enemy of my enemy is my friend. So, Jim is actually my friend. But… because he is his own worst enemy, the enemy of my friend is my enemy. So, actually Jim is my enemy. But-  				",6,7,87
Dwight," No, no, no, no. I got a pumpernickel just for you. ",6,8,88
Dwight," Oh, why? Is there a place closer that sells them?",6,8,88
Dwight," Oh, don’t mention it.  You owe me one.  You all owe me one.    				",6,8,88
Dwight,  Fish sticks are not an aphrodisiac.   ,6,8,88
Dwight,  Regardless.  That was over two hours ago and it is now a scientific fact that you are hungry.  [holds up tray] Bagel?,6,8,88
Dwight, Okay. [walks out of Michael’s office] You owe me.   				,6,8,88
Dwight, Can’t a guy just buy some bagels for his friends so they’ll owe him a favor which he can use to get someone fired who stole a co-manager position from him anymore?  Geez.  When did everyone get so cynical?  				,6,8,88
Dwight," That’s right.  You’re a woman and you need to refuse food the first time.  I’ll try again.  Please Pam, reconsider and have a bagel.",6,8,88
Dwight,  Let me guess– you ate the bagel I gave you and loved it.,6,8,88
Dwight,  I will.  [Andy rubs the briefcase against Dwight’s face]  				,6,8,88
Dwight,  Let me get that door for you–  [runs to open door],6,8,88
Dwight,"  Oh… goodness… thanks.  You know, here’s a healthy fitness tip.  If you clench your buttocks together while walking you can really take the pressure off your knees.  ",6,8,88
Dwight," Yeah, feel free to use that.  Anytime.  Okay.  ",6,8,88
Dwight, [straightens Andy’s tie]  And that needs to be straight as an arrow. ,6,8,88
Dwight, [pulls out Andy’s chair] Have a seat.  Allow me.,6,8,88
Dwight,  You know what?  I am going to preemptively change the batteries in your wireless mouse.  ,6,8,88
Dwight,"  No, no, no! [takes mouse and runs away]",6,8,88
Dwight,  Andy is complicating things.  But I’m not worried.  This will only up my game.    				,6,8,88
Dwight,  There is no book.  There’s only a survival guide.  ,6,8,88
Dwight," Okay, well, allow me.  You know what– gosh these tacos are awfully complicated to make.  I will make everyone’s tacos! Gra-ga-ga-ga-ga!  				",6,8,88
Dwight,"  Hey, hey, hey–  relax I got it covered.",6,8,88
Dwight," No, no, no, no, no, no, I insist.   [pushes Andy out of the room and locks the door] ",6,8,88
Dwight,  Don’t worry about it.  You can just owe me.  				,6,8,88
Dwight," Oh yeah, you’re going to owe me big time.",6,8,88
Dwight, Got it. [looks at envelope] To Dwight. Wha–  [opens envelope] Starbucks gift card.  ,6,8,88
Dwight,  Dammit.  I am no closer to taking Jim down.  What a waste of a day.  I could of grown poisoned mushrooms that would have been this high by now. [bends over and hold hand about 1/2 an inch from the floor]  They’re mushrooms.  They don’t get that high.  				,6,8,88
Dwight," [walks with Michael back into the office; Michael is clutching is face and limping] Wait, why are you limping?",6,8,88
Dwight,  Let’s get some raw meat on that face.  I got a chicken in the freezer upstairs.  				,6,8,88
Dwight,"  Good, good.  Keep it on there for another five minutes.  Just let the swelling go down.",6,8,88
Dwight,  You know what you can keep your stupid favor.  It’s worthless.  And this is my dinner on your face.  I’m keeping it.  ,6,8,88
Dwight,"  How can I pose this to you in a relatable way?  You are all members of the Yakuza and you happen to be visiting the Lackawanna trolley museum… and you are attacked by triads… how can you hold them off until your clan arrives?  You cannot go wrong with a throat punch [screams, pretends to punch Meredith in the throat]",6,9,89
Dwight,"  No, there is a defense for that.  Let me demonstrate.  Someone attack me.  Kevin, go!",6,9,89
Dwight,  False.  I did choke you with your shoelace.  Now come at me!,6,9,89
Dwight,  That is correct.  Unless there happened to be measles present.,6,9,89
Dwight,  Easy.  Allow me to demonstrate.  I am attacking myself with a throat punch.  Here it comes. [gives himself a fake throat punch]  Block.  Grasp wrist as such. [grasps wrist] ,6,9,89
Dwight,"  Good point.  Second, throat punch, absorb the blow. [gives himself another throat punch and proceeds to both attack and defend himself]  Groin punch, hip block, elbow to the gut.  Uh oh, up to the nose.  No, you’re not.  Ow!  Oh!",6,9,89
Dwight," He really is, but not for long.  [steps on foot]  Ow! Instep, oh, not again.  [more screaming] You let go, you let go.  Oh, you’re right, I can’t hold on.",6,9,89
Dwight,  The important thing to remember Jim… we always have what is called the element of surprise. [hits himself in the groin and moans]  				,6,9,89
Dwight,  What is the meaning of this email that everyone got?,6,9,89
Dwight," This one, from David Wallace to all Dunder Mifflin.",6,9,89
Dwight,  Hello everyone I am sure you have seen the item in the Journal.  I just want to stress that it’s all conjecture.  If there’s any concrete news you will know ASAP.,6,9,89
Dwight,  You know what?  You can all have jobs at Schrute Farms as human scarecrows.  It doesn’t pay much and you can’t unionize.  				,6,9,89
Dwight,  [Michael leaves] He needs me.  Seat saved infinity. [leaves],6,9,89
Dwight,"  Wait a minute, wait a minute.  I’m the butler.  You were listening in on that?  You rich people.  You think you can do whatever you want to the servant class!",6,9,89
Dwight,"  Voodoo Mama Juju, explain your dalliance with the Dark Arts.",6,9,89
Dwight,"  I know she didn’t do it.  It’s never the person you most suspect. It’s also never the person you least suspect, since anyone with half a brain would suspect them the most.  Therefore I know the killer to be Phyllis, AKA Beatrix Bourbon, the person I most medium suspect.  				",6,9,89
Dwight,"  Frankly, I’m not surprised.  A lot of the evidence seemed to be based on puns.  				",6,9,89
Dwight,"  You’re sure it was water, it couldn’t have been acid?",6,9,89
Dwight," Happy Earth Day, everyone. I’m Recyclops. Did you know that an old milk carton can be sawed in half and used as a planter?  				",6,10,90
Dwight, Who has put a number seven plastic in a number four bin?  				,6,10,90
Dwight, Recylops will drown you in your over-watered lawns.   				,6,10,90
Dwight, Recyclops destroys! [starts tearing through the office],6,10,90
Dwight, Polluticorn wishes. [starts spraying the office with something],6,10,90
Dwight, Humans are terrible for the environment.  				,6,10,90
Dwight, What kind of mileage does this baby get?,6,10,90
Dwight, Michael Scott you run the most profitable branch of Dunder Mifflin. How do you do it?,6,10,90
Dwight," Coming through. Che, che, che, che, che, che. [spots microphone and gets in line, sees an empty mic and attempts to get there first] Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. [a line appears from nowhere] Ah. Damn it. [ heads back to the original line which is now even longer] Wha- okay [grunts]  				",6,10,90
Dwight," I was hoping to lob Michael his softball question early. I wanted to swing by the garment district, pick up a few crates of my shirts. I got a shirt guy.  				",6,10,90
Dwight," Oh, I’m sorry. Were you raised in a household with no consequences?",6,10,90
Dwight, Oh. If onlys and justs were candies and nuts then every day would be Erntedankfest.  				,6,10,90
Dwight," Dwight Schrute, Scranton branch. I just want to say that I have been standing in this line all day and if this line is any indication of how this company is being run then we are in big trouble. [cheers from crowd] Thank you. Right. I know. And I just want to say that I believe that there are options out there. [crowd still applauding] A take a number option like they have in a deli. What about line varieties? Like an express line for quick comments of ten words or less. They can move much more efficiently. What about ropes along the lines that you can hold on to.",6,10,90
Dwight," My idea.  I just need Andy to think it’s his idea.  So it won’t get traced back to me.  In approximately six hours, Jim will get a phone call from David Wallace.  He will be fired.  				",6,11,91
Dwight," Cool.  Very cool.  I bet if you tried, you could grow the best beard of anyone in this office.",6,11,91
Dwight, I didn’t mean any of those things I just said.  And you can expect the same from everyone in this office if you don’t nip this whole Employee of the Month situation in the bud.  Make it about the work.,6,11,91
Dwight," This encompasses all available data.  Hours, tardiness, unconfirmed sick days, participation.  Everyone has been assigned a random number for total fairness and transparency.  Also, this should be accompanied by a monetary prize.",6,11,91
Dwight," In an ideal world, I would have all ten fingers on my left hand, so my right hand could just be a fist for punching.",6,11,91
Dwight, I’m going to run this by Toby and Accounting and have him assemble the data.,6,11,91
Dwight," Hey, so Jim thought it would be ideal if we all pitched in-",6,11,91
Dwight, So Jim thought it would be ideal if we all pitched in a 20 for this whole Employee of the Month thing.,6,11,91
Dwight, He thought you were doing an incredible job last month.,6,11,91
Dwight, Five minutes ahead of schedule.  Right on schedule.  				,6,11,91
Dwight," Yeah, you said “In an ideal world, there would be a cash prize.”  Isn’t that what you said?",6,11,91
Dwight, There must be some reasonable explanation for this.,6,11,91
Dwight," [imitating Kevin] This is Kevin Malone, is David there?",6,11,91
Dwight," Tell him I’m mad at Jim, because he’s asking us to give money to Pam.  				",6,11,91
Dwight, [imitating Stanley] This is Stanley Hudson.  Jim Halpert is a menace.  				,6,11,91
Dwight," [imitating Toby] It’s Toby Flenderson.  Listen, things are getting really bad down here.  				",6,11,91
Dwight, What?  Diabolical plan?  I wouldn’t even know how to begin a diabol… [Ryan holds up a written copy of Dwight’s daibolical plan],6,11,91
Dwight," But effective, look! [everyone turns to pay attention] On behalf of Jim and I, Merry Christmas.",6,12,92
Dwight, My diabolical plot is on hold for Christmas. My heart just melts with the sound of children singing. Hmmph! [laughs] Not really! I’m just tired. The days are short. I don’t know. Maybe I’m depressed.  ,6,12,92
Dwight, Thirty! Twenty-nine! Twenty-eight! [others join],6,12,92
Dwight," Yes, we are unveiling, an artificial tree, that will never die…",6,12,92
Dwight, This was a successful unveiling! Go back to work! Merry Christmas!   ,6,12,92
Dwight," For several weeks, my Secret Santa has been giving me pieces of a machine that I’ve been attempting to assemble. I’m suspicious of this because I had the exact same idea, for catching Osama bin Laden. I would simply send him a different piece each day. He would assemble it, to find himself… in jail!  ",6,12,92
Dwight," Excuse me. Whoever has been sending me the parts to this gun, I think you sent me a gear instead of a trigger.",6,12,92
Dwight, Not a gun. [crosses gun off his “what could it be” list]  ,6,12,92
Dwight, We don’t have a North Pole branch. Idiot. [grabs package] ,6,12,92
Dwight, Yes! [Dwight opens package to reveal another machine part],6,12,92
Dwight," [singing] I walk a lonely road, the only one that I have ever known. Don’t know where it goes, but it’s home to me and I walk alone. [Meredith and Madge help right the Christmas tree]",6,12,92
Dwight, [singing] My shadow’s the only one that walks beside me. My shallow heart’s the only thing that’s beating…  ,6,12,92
Dwight," Oh man! [Dwight dropped a walnut into the nutcracker] I can use this for so many nuts! Macadamias, Brazil nuts, pecans, almonds. Clams, snails…  ",6,12,92
Dwight, It’s real slippery out here. [sound of drummer’s starts],6,12,92
Dwight," Oh, we will. Have a seat. [Michael gives a pleased look then exits]  				",6,13,93
Dwight," He has more character in a single flake of his dandruff then you have in that entire snow bank on your shoulder. Wait, what was the question?",6,13,93
Dwight," Dwight? Who is this Dwight? Oh! You mean Dwight Schrute, the company’s top salesman and the creator of Computron. I wear many hats but the one I’m currently wearing is that of gracious host. [laughs] Welcome. [Dwight exits]",6,13,93
Dwight," [as Eric is being escorted out by Michael and Toby] Thank you, so much.",6,13,93
Dwight, But the little cars go in the compact spot! ,6,13,93
Dwight, Here we go. [scans stuffed animal] Oh! Wow. ,6,14,94
Dwight, Welcome. Scranton hot dog from Scranton?,6,14,94
Dwight,  They’re 2 ounce paper cups dipped in plastic. He goes through 20 a day. ,6,14,94
Dwight, [looking through Michael’s email] I’m not seeing anything under “confirmation.”,6,15,95
Dwight, Could it be under “affirmation?” Cause you have thousands of those.,6,15,95
Dwight, You [i]did[/i] get the e-vite to my barbeque!,6,15,95
Dwight," I am treating you the same as a man, for whom I would also not stand. Unless it was the President. Or Judge Judy.",6,15,95
Dwight," [on phone] Bobcat, this is Dragon. Listen. He’s been promoted to sole manager. We’ve got to step this up. Meet me behind the dumpster in ninety seconds. [hangs up phone] 89… 88…   				",6,15,95
Dwight, Just admit you lost track of time.  				,6,15,95
Dwight, Ryan and I have been meeting up to work on our diabolical plot against Jim. Ryan is always late for our meetings. I wish I had a lair.  				,6,15,95
Dwight, Of course I seesaw. Mose and I seesaw all the time.,6,15,95
Dwight," Oh, yeah. Great film. Almost as fun as going on a seesaw.",6,15,95
Dwight, I like where you’re going with this. Continue.,6,15,95
Dwight," It’s kinda smelly, but that might be a plus! And then what?",6,15,95
Dwight," Okay, that’s your idea? Exactly like in the movie!? That is the most idiotic thing I have ever heard in my life!",6,15,95
Dwight, He’s supposed to cut his leg off? Think!,6,15,95
Dwight," I think he is the key. He’s very trusting, he’s looking for friends, he has been given an awesome amount of power, and does not know how to wield it.",6,15,95
Dwight," Why don’t you just let me handle the Tolkien references, okay dumb jock?",6,15,95
Dwight, Smeagol was corrupted and became Gollum.  				,6,15,95
Dwight, I might start a diabolical plot against him after this one.  				,6,15,95
Dwight," You know, we really don’t announce out loud our sales that much.",6,15,95
Dwight," Ho-ho. There he is, the IT guy. So you discovered the break room.",6,15,95
Dwight," I imagine one of the best things about being an IT guy is, you get to know everyone’s computer passwords.",6,15,95
Dwight," Listen, I know you have to say that, but we got a little problem here. There is an employee named Jim Halpert, and he is doing some terrible things, okay? He is molesting people via the internet. And we need to stop him.",6,15,95
Dwight," No, the cops called us. So I’m gonna need you to give me the password to Jim Halpert’s computer.",6,15,95
Dwight," Well, well, well. Hm. Boss for, what was it? Oh, four and a half hours? New record. Low. Previous record? Henry Rosston. Boss for nine years, four months. And he only left because he had family matters to attend to and he [Jim dunks Dwight’s tie in his coffee cup, Pam smiles] what? Michael!  				",6,15,95
Dwight, [entering elevator with Ryan] I can’t help but think that something we did made this possible.,6,15,95
Dwight," Oh temp, I like that. I’m going to engrave that into a piece of wood. Care to celebrate with a drink?",6,15,95
Dwight, Because! Martini bars are pretentious. No thank you.,6,15,95
Dwight," It is not “farm boy swill,” I will show you. It is beet Vodka and it is delicious.",6,15,95
Dwight,"  No, no!  You need to come by your sales honorably!",6,16,96
Dwight,"  [on the phone with a client]  Hey there.  Dwight Schrute here.  Listen, uh, would you be interested in restocking on paper? …  Yeah, I could sure use the money.  My cousin, uh, came down with a case of that nasty new goat fungus.  Oh, it’s just horrific.  The  doctor says he’d never seen it beard so quickly.  Okay.  				",6,16,96
Dwight,"  I need a baby.  I’ll never outsell Jim and Pam without one.  Also, I’ve been noticing a gaping hole in my life.  Sometimes I wake up cradling a gourd.  				",6,16,96
Dwight,  [with Angela in the break room]  Bare my child.,6,16,96
Dwight,"  I want to have a child for business reasons and I want you to be the mother.  If you agree, say nothing.  If you disagree, say anything…  Very well.  Let’s meet at 4:00 PM at our old meeting spot and bang it out.  				",6,16,96
Dwight,"  Before we conceive a child, uh, it is important that we bang out a parenting contract.",6,16,96
Dwight,  It’s been a long time since we’ve come down here separately.,6,16,96
Dwight,"  Now, then.  Let’s get to it, shall we?  Item one:",6,16,96
Dwight,  Acceptable names include and are limited to:,6,16,96
Dwight,"  Irrelevant question.  Section 5A, child shall be male.",6,16,96
Dwight,"  It’s as simple as keeping the womb extremely warm for two days after sex, and then extremely cold for five months.",6,16,96
Dwight,"  No, no, no.  Ambulances are emergencies only.  You call an ambulance, I call the cops.",6,16,96
Dwight,  Has anyone checked how dilated she is?  This is ridiculous!,6,16,96
Dwight,  [as he holds up the tape measure with his initials on it] “We” don’t.,6,16,96
Dwight,  [as he peels out of the parking lot and stops] Michael!,6,16,96
Dwight,  This is where I saw that deer last week.,6,16,96
Dwight,"  I love escorting people.  In fact, a few years back, I put an ad in the paper starting an escort service.  I got a lot of responses.  Mostly creeps.  Made a few friends.  				",6,16,96
Dwight,"  Ugh, alright.  [as he puts a police siren on top of his car]  Let’s move!  …  What?",6,16,96
Dwight,  Why didn’t you ask me to do it yesterday?  I kept IM’ing you how bored I was.,6,16,96
Dwight,"  No, no, don’t, don’t tell me.  Alalalalalalalalalala lalalalalala alalalalalalalala.",6,16,96
Dwight,"  Yesterday, I was dispatched to Jim and Pam’s house to find Pam’s iPod.  I searched everywhere, but I didn’t find it.  What I did find, was mold, and lots of it.  So, I did what anyone would do.  Read a book, had a bath, I got a good night’s sleep, and I made plans to eradicate it.  I also made plans to ask Jim where he bought his marvelous sheets…  Time to get to work [he begins to destroy the kitchen with a sledgehammer].  				",6,16,96
Dwight,"  Nothing left to do except dot the I’s, the J’s, and the umlauts.  Why don’t you meet me here at exactly mid-late afternoon?",6,16,96
Dwight,"  Isabelle.  Hello…  Yeah, the uh, kitchen was disgusting, so…",6,16,96
Dwight,"  Oh, it’s…  In the backyard.  I’ll take this.",6,16,96
Dwight,"  Hey, listen.  I know that I’m an adult, but maybe I could come by sometime for a teeth cleaning.  You know, just for fun.",6,16,96
Dwight,"  Are they now?  Ha ha, how some people spend their money, right?  Ha ha.",6,16,96
Dwight,  Just pour yourself a cup of apple juice.  I feel sick…  [Jim and Pam walk in to their house with the baby]  I couldn’t find the iPod…  Give me a couple days.  I’ll be out of your hair.  				,6,16,96
Dwight," Very good. Okay. Will get back to you right away on that, thanks.",6,17,97
Dwight," Dweedle Dee and Dweedle Dumb-ass have been away on maternity leave. Now Dweedle Dumb-ass is back, and we have a problem. Yes, getting hooked on Mega-Desk was my own damn fault. But … I don’t care about assigning blame. All I care about is Mega-Desk. That is all I care about. Getting. More. Mega-Desk.  				",6,17,97
Dwight, Oh come on. Come on. Five more minutes? Five more minutes of Mega-Desk? Please? ,6,17,97
Dwight, They say that no man is an island. False! I am an island and this island is volcanic. And it is about to erupt. With the molten hot lava of strategy!  				,6,17,97
Dwight," Must be amazing being a father right, a miracle of life?",6,17,97
Dwight," Ah, that baby is just discovering the whole wide world right now.",6,17,97
Dwight," What up is, what down is, who Mom is, who Dad is. Must be tough being here with all that going on.",6,17,97
Dwight," I mean, you’re here at work, and the baby thinks that the refrigerator is its father.",6,17,97
Dwight," I’ll tell you what happened to me. I didn’t see my father for the first two years of my life. I thought my mother was my father, and my wet-nurse was my mother.",6,17,97
Dwight," Turned out fine for me. But Mose? Oh. Same story, different ending.  				",6,17,97
Dwight," [Whispers] Oh Jim, Jim! Sorry to bother you.",6,17,97

Dwight," “-Dad, you know we’ll have a good time then.”",6,17,97
Dwight," Ah. Got a little client meeting at Shanny O’Gannigan’s tonight. It shouldn’t go all night long, so if you’d like me to, I could swing by your house so the baby can experience a strong male presence. [Jim is silent] No? Nothing? Okay. Have fun working.

Dwight," Hi there Jo. Sorry to interrupt. Um, this evening [phone rings] I have…",6,17,97

Dwight," That’s ridiculous, this is made up of three desks.",6,17,97

Dwight,  You couldn’t handle my undivided attention.  				,6,18,98
Dwight," Listen, Michael – about what happened earlier. ",6,18,98
Dwight," Yeah. You got any news on the leads? … Okay, I’ll tell you what. I’m going out on a very important sales call. You get any news about the leads, you try me. All of my numbers. All six of my numbers, okay? Including the car phone! [leaves office] Alright, Dwight out!  				",6,18,98
Dwight," Salesman is king. As the best salesman, I am king of kings. Oh, you say Jesus is king of kings? Well. What does that say to you about how I think of myself?  				",6,18,98
Dwight," What are you doing, idiot? [Jim is crouched down, peering under a car]",6,18,98
Dwight, Scavenger hunt? Here. I can solve it. Give it. [grabs card] ‘The treasure you seek is in the parking lot under the first president.’,6,18,98

Dwight," I’ll go, Michael. You’ll just screw it up.  				",6,18,98
Dwight, [looks around dump] This place has gone to hell. ,6,18,98
Dwight,"  Yeah, well, the acorn becomes the oak.",6,18,98
Dwight," Oh, why, because I have a shot at a $100k commission? ",6,18,98
Dwight, Hey. There is nothing I can do about my wide-set eyes.,6,18,98
Dwight," When I first met you, I had a lot of job offers. And I had an offer from Ivan Schartsky. The Ivan Schartsky. And if I’d assistant managed him – ",6,18,98
Dwight," Oh, that’s low! I would be number two right now at Home Depot!",6,18,98
Dwight," Okay? Because they promote from within. Instead I had to follow you – you, going nowhere.",6,18,98
Dwight, I hitched my wagon to a horse with no legs. ,6,18,98
Dwight, Nice babies you’re making with the floozies at the bars.,6,18,98
Dwight," Your made-up wife? Who doesn’t exist? [Michael picks up a piece of metal and hurls it at Dwight, who sidesteps] You watch it!",6,18,98
Dwight, Don’t do it [lobs something at Michael],6,18,98
Dwight," [kicks spool] Stop it, get out! That’s my spool.   				",6,18,98
Dwight," [surveys the mountains of trash surrounding them] Wow. Amazing, isn’t it. No other animal on earth could do this. Maybe beavers. But not like this.  				",6,18,98
Dwight," Hey [holds up an old sweater] You know who’d like this? Phyllis. Purple, much?",6,18,98
Dwight," [drives into office parking lot, honking horn. Enormous purple object strapped to the roof of their car] Woo hoo!",6,18,98
Dwight, We have an awesome bean bag chair that’s perfect for the break room. [reaches out the window and pats it],6,18,98
Dwight," Yeah, damn right you’re not. ‘Cause it’s for me and Michael only [they both cheer and high-five]  				",6,18,98
Dwight,"Hold that thought. Well, well, well. If it isn’t Isabel.",6,19,99
Dwight,What’s a girl like you doing in a place like this?,6,19,99
Dwight,Usually means there’s a battle scene coming.   				,6,19,99
Dwight,"Universal donor. [startled by Angela, curses]   				",6,19,99
Dwight,"Angela versus Isabel. Height, advantage Isabel. Birthing hips, advantage Isabel. Remaining child-bearing years, advantage Isabel. Legal obligation, advantage Angela.  				",6,19,99
Dwight,Whacking moles. Hit ’em on the head. Whack. Say it with me.,6,19,99
Dwight,"Look, I’ve been thinking. We had a good run. We really did. But you don’t need to worry about this whole contract thing anymore.",6,19,99
Dwight,"It’s just that we both-we want different things. You know, I want a big family.",6,19,99
Dwight,"No, no, no, no. I want a big family. Tall. Thick. A big, physically big family. Listen, you go have fun. You’re off the hook.",6,19,99
Dwight,"Dissolved. Don’t worry, you’re free. Okay? Okay. See you later.",6,19,99
Dwight,"Oh, please. I wish he’d come after me.  I would be like-aaah!",6,19,99
Dwight,"No, no, no. [trying to talk over her] Blah blah blah blah!",6,19,99
Dwight,You’re really putting me in an awkward position here.,6,19,99
Dwight," Why is everyone clumped around accounting? Break it up, you clique.",6,20,100
Dwight, [gets up and starts to walk to Oscar’s desk] Is that the program where all those puppets live in the barrio?,6,20,100
Dwight," That is an amusing link. I’d like it sent to me, please.",6,20,100
Dwight," Well, I knew it existed, and I chose to let it die.",6,20,100
Dwight, Her milk is coming in. She’s getting uncomfortable.,6,20,100
Dwight," Same thing happens with my cows if I don’t tend them frequently enough. You gotta milk them, or else they’ll moo like crazy. ",6,20,100
Dwight," [removes jacket, applies hand sanitizer] All right, this is gonna traumatize me a hell of a lot more than you, believe me.",6,20,100
Dwight, Really? Fine. Let your breasts explode. Three squeezes and I would drain you. ,6,20,100
Dwight," Wait, What? I was just slow-clapping your no-nonsense decision-making.",6,20,100
Dwight," [gets up and walks towards Gabe] Prideful idiots. Watch how it’s done. [Jim and Pam get their things together and start to leave] Gabriel, I apologize.",6,20,100
Dwight, Humbly taking your hand upon which I kiss to show my contrition. ,6,20,100
Dwight, What was that? Are you kidding me? Was that an impression?,6,20,100
Dwight, “I have to go back to the zoo to the stick insect exhibit.”,6,20,100
Dwight," I don’t understand why Michael is wasting his time with Spanish. I have it on very good authority that within 20 years, everyone will be speaking German. Or a Chinese-German hybrid.   				",6,21,101
Dwight," You know what? I should be getting this client, Michael. My numbers are better than either of theirs. ",6,21,101
Dwight," If you want people to put the best face on something, why would you get two people who probably never cut the face off of anything in their lives?",6,21,101
Dwight," It doesn’t just sound a’ight, it sounds amazing.",6,21,101
Dwight," Uh, glasses wearers. Cholera survivors. Geniuses. Non-organic family farmers. The list goes on and on. You want me to keep going? ",6,21,101
Dwight," Ten seconds ago, this guy was driving a forklift. Okay? Now all off a sudden he’s Cinderella of the office. What are you guys thinking?",6,21,101
Dwight," One minority from this branch is going to get into this program. Who would I refer? Hmm… the competent, hardworking one who does things his own way, or the malleable simpleton who can be bought for a few fashion magazines?  				",6,21,101
Dwight," Well, you can kinda tell from the voice.",6,21,101
Dwight," I bet you get pulled over by the cops a lot, just because of your race.",6,21,101
Dwight, I think you should consider applying for the executive minority training program. ,6,21,101
Dwight," I know, ’cause you have no role models. How many Indian CEO’s can you think of?",6,21,101
Dwight, You could be the Indian Bill Gates. You could be the Indian Ted Turner.,6,21,101
Dwight," Oh, good, and you resent this because… ",6,21,101
Dwight," Oh, no, no. That’s not dorky. [Dwight wears his phone like that] Look, it’s easily accessible. Boom, like this. 911, hello. Scranton Strangler’s in the house. Inside the house.",6,21,101
Dwight," You know, we really should keep practicing for this interview.",6,21,101
Dwight," Kelly will be even worse than Darryl. If you’d have told me this morning that today I’d be creating a monster capable f my own destruction, I ‘d have thought you were referring to the bull Mose and I are trying to reanimate.   				",6,21,101
Dwight," You said the program is not open to Caucasians. Well… anthropologically, she is Indian. Indians migrated from the caucuses region of Europe. Therefore, technically, she is Caucasian. You’re welcome, America.",6,21,101
Dwight," Well, obviously, she is brownish. But come on, I mean, Darryl is far more ethnic. ",6,21,101
Dwight," Oh, dear God. Okay. Don’t make any decisions just yet. Okay? I’ll be right back. ",6,21,101
Dwight, How would one of you feel if I told you I could put you on a fast track to an executive position at this company?,6,21,101
Dwight, What I’m offering is a ticket on a bullet train straight to middle management.,6,21,101
Dwight," Speaking of rainbows, Oscar… you are kind of a double minority. Gay. So we at Sabre could really benefit from your perspective. ",6,21,101
Dwight, I can protect you from Kelly. [Erin stifles laugh] Will you get out of here? Seriously. [Erin turns and leaves kitchen]  				,6,21,101
Dwight," Whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa! This is Hide Toshi Hasagawa. He would like to apply for the Sabre minority executive training program “print in all colors” initiative. ",6,21,101
Dwight, Helping heal America in a dramatic fashion in the 11th hour.,6,21,101
Dwight," Caucasians, am I right? [to Hide] Have a seat. I’ll translate.",6,21,101
Dwight," Hey, kiddo. Congratulations are in order. You deserve it. [Dwight extends his hand, but Kelly hugs him]",6,21,101
Dwight," Just once, I would like to be a puppet master and have nothing go wrong. Is that too much to ask?  				",6,21,101
Dwight," You’re talking about me in Morse Code. Well, you know what? Joke’s on you ’cause I know Morse Code. Ha!",6,22,102
Dwight, Very well. I must have imagined it. I apologize. [Pam clacking her stapler and Jim responding with tapping his keyboard rhythmically] Detonator. Detonator where? Michael!   				,6,22,102
Dwight, Fine. [clears throat] Hey. Tap away. [Dwight puts noise-cancelling headphones on and Pam and Jim begin to blink rhythmically]  				,6,22,102
Dwight, I think I’ve got one for you. [hands Michael a business card],6,22,102
Dwight, I’m just gonna warn you… and I say this to all my clients… you might not like what I find. ,6,22,102
Dwight," And you might not like how I find it. [slides over table, leaves]  				",6,22,102
Dwight, [sitting on his Firebird’s hood in front of a gym] Hi stranger.,6,22,102
Dwight," All cases are solved with logic. The only logical way to find out if Donna Is a cheater is to seduce her, bring her to orgasm, then call Michael and tell him the sad news.  				",6,22,102
Dwight," [at gym, looks ready to work out, checks phone, and tries to grab Donna’s attention] Oh, gosh, we were both going for the same weight at the same time; you go ahead. ",6,22,102
Dwight," It’s all yours. [strains loudly to lift two dumbbells and a free weight chained to strap around his head] Ah! [after first rep, Dwight is injured]",6,22,102
Dwight," Yeah, I’m good. Hey, you know an exercise for two people that uses the whole body?",6,22,102
Dwight, Tractor pulling. Too bad there’s not a tractor here.   				,6,22,102
Dwight, [moaning loudly on exercise machine while staring at Donna who’s next to him] Oh. Oh. Oh. [groans loudly] One thing you need to know about me. I don’t quit until something tears or pops. [chuckles] You look like you’re getting a good workout. Can I feel your pulse?,6,22,102
Dwight," Really? Hey, um… [Dwight gets up and walks sorely from his “workout”]",6,22,102
Dwight," Donna. Donna, wait, please. I’m sorry. Okay? Listen. We both know why I’m here:",6,22,102
Dwight," Donna, come… Ah! Grr! Ugh! [Dwight is very sore from his “workout” and cannot chase Donna]  				",6,22,102
Dwight," Oh, I pulled muscles in both my thighs. Thanks for asking.",6,22,102
Dwight," Yeah, no. She’s not cheating. Oh, man! Will you help me work out this knot? Right here. [near his groin]",6,22,102
Dwight," I’m positive. Yeah, oh, and here’s your expense receipts right there. ",6,22,102
Dwight," Oh, me too. And by the way, uh, I told her not to, but she’s coming over here and she’s furious. ",6,22,102
Dwight," You’re right. I was paraphrasing. What she actually said was, [pulls out notebook] “What is with him? He is crazy. I’m coming over there to talk to him.” And this was after I have no other recourse but to tell her and gym security that you had me sent there to see if she was cheating. Also, I joined the gym. You’ll be billed monthly. [lays down gym membership receipt on a chair in Michael’s office. ",6,22,102
Dwight," [on workout bicycle at gym] Okay, everybody, let’s take this next hill.",6,22,102
Dwight," You know what? You had your chance. You’re no leader. Out of your seat, let’s blast!",6,22,102
Dwight, No! The hill’s a trap. Let’s take the dirt road off to the side. ,6,22,102
Dwight," If they catch us, they will rape us. Go for the cliff. And three, two, one… jump! No! [points to those around him] You’re dead, you’re dead, you’re dead. Good jump. You’re barely alive. Okay, now nice cooldown. Check your pulse rate.   				",6,22,102
Dwight,"  You were being really funny, and then you went too far.",6,23,103
Dwight,"  Come on, the whole two bullet thing is a red herring. Here’s how you do it:",6,23,103
Dwight,"  Toby, come on. [Andy lines up to the right of Toby and Phyllis is on his left]",6,23,103
Dwight,"  Ready, one bullet. And boom! [makes shooting noises and mimics a bullet with his fingers tapping Phyllis’ throat, then Toby’s, and finally Andy’s]",6,23,103
Dwight,"  Just try. I will do legal jujitsu on you. Gyah! [pretends to karate chop her neck] See, don’t even need to make contact. The law will do it.  				",6,23,103
Dwight,"  So much of this is just impossible to verify. Item five, point “B”, uh… the beet juice cleanse?",6,23,103
Dwight,  How do we know this? I’d like to see a stool sample.,6,23,103
Dwight,"  I don’t have $30,000 lying around. I have it buried very deeply, and I don’t want to dig past a certain someone to get it.   				",6,23,103
Dwight,"  $30,000? There’s gotta be another way. ",6,23,103
Dwight,  “Intercourse to completion. Five individual times rendered at my discretion?”,6,23,103
Dwight,  Agreed. [shakes hands with Angela]  				,6,23,103
Dwight,"  Five times for $30,000? Not a bad stud fee. Better than most horses.  				",6,23,103
Dwight,  Do you understand how rare is that in nature?,6,23,103
Dwight,"  [pressing buttons to start microwave and moves towards his crotch] I am an honorable man, and I will honor the contract. But I don’t have to give her the good stuff. Schrute sperm are strong, [banging on his crotch with drum sticks] but they’re no match for a grown Schrute man. [drops yellow pages against his crotch] [screaming] [chuckling] Let’s see what she gets. [bouncing crotch on bike and crashes into glass door] [thud] Aah!  				",6,23,103
Dwight,  Are you warmed up? [outside sliding door in warehouse],6,23,103
Dwight,"  God, Angela, why is that always my responsibility? [zipper sound]",6,23,103
Dwight,"  Oh, it’ll work. [Jim and Pam look shocked and disturbed] Mm. Stop kissing me. It’s not in the contract.  				",6,23,103
Dwight," Michael, you have to see, this is like, the cutest thing ever.   				",6,24,104
Dwight," Apache persuasion hold, that’s the hell! What are you doing to my computer?",6,24,104
Dwight," You’re with Big Brother? Okay, go ahead. I got nothing to hide.",6,24,104
Dwight," Hold that thought. I don’t want to waste your time, and I wouldn’t dare waste mine. I didn’t do it. Now, I don’t know exactly who did it, but I have a list right here… [hands Jo a piece of paper] You should fire the following people.",6,24,104
Dwight, Why would I disparage a company that has made me rich beyond my wildest dreams? ,6,24,104
Dwight, [sees Toby banging on the vending machine] Let me give you a hand. ,6,24,104
Dwight," Ready? [they pull the vending machine towards them; Dwight’s phone rings] Got it? Oh shoot. Got it? [walks away, opens phone] Dwight Schrute.",6,24,104
Dwight, Basement office? You mean like a lair?  				,6,24,104
Dwight," Cancel it. I want you to make an offer at seventeen twenty-five Slough Avenue. Make ’em an offer they can’t refuse. No, on second thought, low ball them. Don’t call me ’til you have it. ",6,24,104
Dwight," Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey IT guy. Here’s the story, champ. None of us have spent a lot of time getting to know you, okay? We liked the last guy, Siddiq, because he kept to himself, and we also thought he might have been a terrorist. You know what, I’m going to leave you with one other thought. Inner city kids use computers for two things, games and porn. So good luck wasting your life, lurch. ",6,24,104
Dwight," I’m about to buy this building, you know.",6,24,104
Dwight," Well, I’m one-eighths proud of you… enjoy that chair for now… ’cause pretty soon, you will be on your feet, at Buckingham Palace.  				",6,24,104
Dwight," Hiya! Ha! [climbs on Phyllis’ desk and starts kicking things off, bites off the head of a stuffed animal]",7,1,106
Dwight," From now on, if you’re hot, sit on an ice pack.",7,1,106
Dwight," Like you’d ever be cold, Kevin. Stop asking me hypothetical questions, OK? I’m too busy.",7,1,106
Dwight," [drinking from Camelback] Jim, you have one job to do. And you do it forgettably.  Those of us who are busy require hands-free hydration.  				",7,1,106
Dwight," Dwight Schrute, star salesman, beet farmer, bed-and-breakfast proprietor, aspiring freelance bodyguard. Add to that list owner of this building. Then burn the list.  				",7,1,106
Dwight," The bigger the key chain, the more powerful the man.",7,1,106
Dwight," [Jim quietly takes Dwight’s keychain and starts adding keys to it, Pam giggles] Hey, what’s so funny over here? Ha. Very nice. Give me my keys. [removes keys and throws them at Jim] Ha. Ha. Not. Funny. Jim.",7,1,106
Dwight," [as elevator doors won’t shut] Okay, that’s weird. Just hitting “door closed.” What?",7,1,106
Dwight," Is this elevator going up? Hey, the elevator is disobeying us! [elevator stops between floors]  Okay, okay. We are stuck. We are stuck. Hank, Hank! Can you hear us? Oh, my God. Okay. Emergency protocol.",7,1,106
Dwight," Pam, try and pry open those front doors, immediately. ",7,1,106
Dwight, Use your talons! Pry ’em open! [starts to urinate in elevator corner],7,1,106
Dwight, I’ve got 56 ounces of fluid in my bladder! And we have to establish a pee corner! ,7,1,106
Dwight,  Why didn’t I think of this before? Did you know that there is a daycare center opening right here in this building?,7,2,107
Dwight,"  Now that I own the building, I’m looking for new sources of revenue. And a daycare center… Ha ha ha [laughing maniacally] Well I guess it’s not an evil idea. It’s just a regular idea. But there is no good laugh for a regular idea.   				",7,2,107
Dwight,  Welcome to the Sesame Avenue Daycare Center for infants and toddlers. ,7,2,107
Dwight,  Oh no. I like to think of it as a kids place. Would you like a tour?,7,2,107
Dwight,  Come on. Here is the language skills and cognitive development area. These are English… uh… letters. [pause] I see you found out magical toy box Jim. ,7,2,107
Dwight,"  Jim! To you and me, maybe, but, come on! To a child’s imagination that’s Mr. Fork and Lieutenant Knife and… Ms. Fork. ",7,2,107
Dwight,  Oh! That shouldn’t have been in there. I’m embarrassed. ,7,2,107
Dwight,"  We come fully equipped with a restroom. Feeding trough, play bucket, and room for a plant, in success. ",7,2,107
Dwight,  No one. The door locks from the outside. Escape is impossible. ,7,2,107
Dwight,"  I promise you, that door locks! [Jim closes the door]  				",7,2,107
Dwight,"  Boycott the Steamtown Mall! Everyone, you heard me! Cancel all of your business with the Steamtown Mall!",7,2,107
Dwight,"  All of it! The mall, the stores, the kiosks!",7,2,107
Dwight,"  Yeah, something happened. Oh yeah, something happened, Jim. ",7,2,107
Dwight,  Yes I did. And I’m going to do the same with all of your clients. ,7,2,107
Dwight,"  Oh yes I will! That mall is corrupt, ok! They’re “appearance”ists!",7,2,107
Dwight,"  You guys know me. You know that I’m not one for fancy things, but there was this one thing. It was in a fancy store. And it caught the corner of my eye when I took Mose down to the Mall to get his blood pressure at the Rite-Aid. And I thought, you know, maybe I deserve this. You know, I had a great crop yield this fall…",7,2,107
Dwight,"  I went to the store and I pressed the buzzer, and they looked right at me, and then they looked away. And then I pressed the buzzer again, and they started taking pictures of me on their mobile phones. I guess I’m not the kind of guy that’s good enough for precious heirlooms.",7,2,107
Dwight,"  Apparently there is a famous Hollywood movie from the 1980’s, Beautiful Girl…",7,2,107
Dwight,"  Apparently, it’s one of the best revenge stories of all times, in which this sex worker, who is the antagonist… That can’t be right. Andy? How does it…?",7,2,107
Dwight,"  Ok, Um… The sex worker is denied service at a fancy store because she does not look wealthy. She later returns dressed in all the “trappings” of extravagant wealth, but instead of going…",7,2,107
Dwight,  Wait. Less matching to appear more rich?,7,2,107
Dwight,"  Wait, I see you every day. Can I say “Good month?”",7,2,107
Dwight,  It is a pewter wizard holding a crystal. ,7,2,107
Dwight, Because I’m here for one thing. Revenge. ,7,2,107
Dwight,"  I was here yesterday, and you refused to wait on me.",7,2,107
Dwight,  It was beet juice! I am a beet farmer idi…,7,2,107
Dwight,  Good sir. I happen to have been working a very long day. When I came to you fine establishment. You are such a… I’m gonna… Ok. Listen. You can’t treat… Thank you! Good morning sir!,7,2,107
Dwight,  [re-entering the store] I’ll take the wizard!,7,2,107
Dwight," Uh, no, thank you. Last time I went to the theater, a man dressed as a cat sat on my lap.  				",7,3,108
Dwight," Please, waste of time. You know what? Let’s just knock this out right now. Disrobe.  				",7,3,108
Dwight, Angela? Don’t like her anymore. Not attracted to her anymore. Just contractually obligated to make a baby with her.   				,7,3,108
Dwight," Alright, fine. I’ll go to your little show, but I’m not wearing a cape.",7,3,108
Dwight, [whispering to man sitting beside him] I work with that guy. ,7,3,108
Dwight, Too bad I’m not gonna explain anything that you miss. ,7,3,108
Dwight, [whispering to man sitting beside him] His name’s Andy. He’s a terrible salesman.   				,7,3,108
Dwight, Why are you dressed like a seed catalogue model?,7,3,108
Dwight, All that singing got in the way of some perfectly good murders.,7,3,108
Dwight," No, no, no. Contractually we’re obligated to have sex.",7,3,108
Dwight," I will tell. I will tell the mediator. What-what are you… [Angela reaches into his pocket] Ok. Oh, was that in the way? Get rid of it. [Angela pulls out hole-punch and punches the card]",7,3,108
Dwight," I pick up day laborers and tell them they’ll get paid at six p.m. At five forty five, a certain INS agent by the name of Mose Schrute throws them in the back of a van, drops them off in the middle of Harrisburg and tells them it’s Canada.  				",7,4,109
Dwight," That is my new maintenance worker, Nate. And you’ll be happy to know that he’s taking care of that hornet’s nest that you’ve been griping about.",7,4,109
Dwight, [looking outside through the window] I left him all the tools he needs. This is do or die. If he chooses correctly he’ll conquer the hornets…,7,4,109
Dwight, When did the phrase do or die become so corrupted?,7,4,109
Dwight," Some eggs can rely dormant in a woman for years, they may not even know they have it.",7,4,109
Dwight, What port? The Jan port. The Holly Por…,7,4,109
Dwight," You need to contact Holly! You need to notify her, that she is crawling with herpes.",7,4,109
Dwight," You need to contact every woman you’ve been with, and notify them of your herpes infestation. It’s the right thing to do.",7,4,109
Dwight," No, I’m no doctor, but it seems to me that we all have an obligation to the public health to track down anyone who gives us a disease, inform them of it, and take overwhelming revenge on that person. Again, I’m no doctor. I’m just a normal guy who enjoys revenge.  				",7,4,109
Dwight, So long Donna! [Michael hangs up]  				,7,4,109
Dwight, [to the camera] He forgot to mention the herpes.,7,4,109
Dwight," We had to come over right away, it’s urgent. Michael has something to tell you. [Michael shushes him]",7,4,109
Dwight," Ok I’m gonna head outta here, I know you have a lot to talk about. Ok, is there a, an operating theater that’s open to visitors? Never mind I’ll find it.",7,4,109
Dwight," Next stop is Helene. You’re gonna wanna make a left on Willow, which is a little ways away, uh. I’ll remind you.",7,4,109
Dwight, Forget it Michael! Today is about herpes.,7,4,109
Dwight," Who gave it to you, who has it, and who is going to pay.",7,4,109
Dwight," TO answer your question about Jan, no. Jan is insane. Why do you think I got- LEFT, WILLOW NOW!",7,4,109
Dwight, Michael! [attempting to get out of the car on the side in which Michael parked too close to a bush. Michael ignores him and walks into a building.],7,4,109
Dwight," [walking downstairs] Excuse me, someone died in the upstairs bathroom didn’t they?",7,4,109
Dwight, It was probably just an ingrown mustache hair but we have to be exhaustive.,7,4,109
Dwight," I’m gonna need a list of every man you’ve ever had sex with. I’m talking train stations, men’s rooms…",7,4,109
Dwight," The woods behind the liquor store, the swamp behind the old folk’s home.",7,4,109
Dwight, Can’t beat a horse. A horse is a bike that peddles itself.,7,5,110
Dwight," Alright. Wait, wait, wait, wait for me! It’s weird if I come in slightly after.  				",7,5,110
Dwight," We have a big meeting with the chief buyer for Frames Select, Steve Nash.",7,5,110
Dwight, Will you stop trying to put it in terms you think they’ll understand? It’s condescending.,7,5,110
Dwight, Go tell her we’re here. You’re good with receptionists.,7,5,110
Dwight," The best salesman ever. He works for Osprey Paper over in Throop, steals more clients from Dunder-Mifflin than anyone.",7,5,110
Dwight," [speaking loudly] So anyway, she says, “that is the biggest penis I have ever seen.” And I said, “I know. That’s why I brought you to the Penis Museum, where tickets are a thousand dollars.” Well, hello Danny!",7,5,110

Dwight, I’ve been in showtime mode since breakfast.,7,5,110
Dwight, I know how we can learn his tricks.  				,7,5,110
Dwight, What I am about to show you is of the utmost secrecy.,7,5,110
Dwight," Yes, Jim. And with a little tweaking, it becomes a different office. We lure Danny to it and watch him sell.",7,5,110
Dwight, Van Helsing was a respected professor before he was a vampire killer.,7,5,110
Dwight," People can’t keep their true natures hidden for long, and this guy is smoldering like a tire fire.",7,5,110
Dwight," I told you! You’re an exec at Stark Industries, a corporation you inherited from your father-",7,5,110
Dwight, Okay. You’re a young hotshot from Stark Industries. You’ve just bought this company. Meredith is fired. It’s a whole new regime. He’s gotta pitch to you now.,7,5,110
Dwight, It’s about this very announcement you just made.,7,5,110
Dwight, Where’s he gonna sit? There’s no more seats.,7,5,110
Dwight, Where’s he gonna park? There’s no more reserved parking spots.,7,5,110
Dwight," Let me handle this, Jim. Drop the act, Cordray, okay? We all know that you probably thought that Pam was too “meh” or thin without being toned. But I wanna tell you something-she is one of the plain hearty women of Scranton that make this city great. And so what if she doesn’t wear makeup? [Pam mouthing “I wear makeup”] We like her better that way! And you steal clients, don’t you? Don’t you!",7,5,110
Dwight," Oh, that’s different, is it? Okay…thief. You better check your things, people. In fact, where are my keys? Oh, there in my pocket. False alarm. Okay. [awkward pause] So…you’re gonna be workin’ here?",7,5,110
Dwight," It’s after 5:00, Jim. I’m not gonna take this home. [shakes Danny’s hand]",7,5,110
Dwight," [standing next to a pony] So long, Stanley!",7,6,111
Dwight," [has his hands around Jim’s neck] Too late! If I was the real Scranton Strangler, you’d be so strangled right now. If you’re out there, strangler, you will get caught! By me. ",7,6,111
Dwight, To my chickens I’m the Scranton Strangler.  [looks at Pam] Oh-ho! That’s very funny. Looks like someone decided to dress up as old Dwight Schrute’s mom.,7,6,111
Dwight, You’re only one third as beautiful and only half her height.,7,6,111
Dwight, Pam is gonna choose whoever has a scent most like that of her father. Does anyone remember what her dad smelled like?,7,6,111
Dwight, He went over your head to go behind your back. ,7,6,111
Dwight," No. Shh. Michael, listen. This cannot stand. We can’t have workers going straight to corporate. Makes your job superfluous. ",7,6,111
Dwight, Yeah. Here’s another good idea. Corporate chain of command. We need to strangle Darryl’s idea.   				,7,6,111
Dwight," Garbage magnet. [throws magnet] Garbage magnet, God! Magnets are interesting enough, you don’t need to tart them up with some design. [to Michael] I can’t believe this doesn’t make you mad!",7,6,111
Dwight," Hmm, Kevin and Gabe. Probably about the extremes of the human physique.",7,6,111
Dwight, Let’s just say I saw exactly what the two of you wanted me to see.  				,7,6,111
Dwight," I know how to sit on a fence. Hell, I can even sleep on a fence. The trick is to do it face down with the post in your mouth.   				",7,6,111
Dwight, Uh-huh. Right. And ruin their cloaks? Do you have any idea how expensive wool is in Transylvania? [looks at camera] ‘Cause of the euro.,7,7,112
Dwight, [rolls his eyes and shakes his head] Uh… ,7,7,112
Dwight," NO, no, no. They will cost you your life.",7,7,112
Dwight," The worst thing you can do for your immune system is to coddle it. They need to fight their own battles. If Sabre really cared about our well-being, they would set up hand de-sanitizing stations. A simple bowl at every juncture filled with dirt, vomit, fecal matter… ",7,7,112
Dwight, Exposing yourself to germs is the best way to make yourself stronger.,7,7,112
Dwight," The principle is sound. To avoid illness, expose yourself to germs, enabling your immune system to develop antibodies. I don’t know why everyone doesn’t do this. Maybe they have something against living forever.  				",7,7,112
Dwight, [handing out cards] For all your paper and printer needs. For all your paper and printer needs. For all your paper and printer needs.  				,7,7,112
Dwight," Good morning. Dwight Schrute. Thank you all for your prayers and your remembrances. Like Justin and his disfigurement, I too have had a horrible year. They say that the middle class is disappearing, and with it, the soul of America. So, as a gift to this beautiful congregation, I would like to offer a 4% discount on all Dunder Mifflin Sabre products if you buy a printer at full price.  				",7,7,112
Dwight," Greg, hello, it’s Dwight from the vestibule. You want to know my eleventh commandment? I will not be undersold.",7,7,112
Dwight, I am ready to love thy neighbor with these kind of discounts.,7,7,112
Dwight," Michael, I’m just about to close a sale. Can I authorize a 15% discount?",7,7,112
Dwight," [sighs] They shouldn’t televise any of this, it just encourages copy-cats.",7,8,113
Dwight, Not because I want to. With all the feeling to base a show around. Glee? Thirst. Now that’s a show I’d watch.,7,8,113
Dwight, Tonight might be a convenient night for us to have some intercourse.  				,7,8,113
Dwight," Michael, I find it absolutely disgraceful that no one followed you in here for your walk-out. I took the liberty of making a list of everyone who didn’t follow you in here. Jim. Oscar. Creed. Me, at first.",7,8,113
Dwight," [continuing] Kelly. Kev- [to Pam] Are you gonna quiet that baby? Or do I have to? [Dwight grabs Cece and makes noises, Cece stops crying] In the Schrute family, the youngest child always raises the others. I’ve been raising children since I was a baby.  				",7,8,113
Dwight," You know it’s not really necessary for me to sit here holding her all night. Just go into Gabe’s refrigerator, get a lump of suit, or any kind of congealed animal fat will do rally, tie a piece of string to it and the other end to her toe, put the suit in her mouth, she’ll be happy for hours.",7,8,113
Dwight," Well something’s come up, I have to go.",7,8,113
Dwight, Enough. I will require beer and pizza to think this over.,7,8,113
Dwight, [referring to the pizza Jim is offering him] Insert it in my mouth.,7,8,113
Dwight, I’d prefer for him to think of it as degrading.,7,8,113
Dwight," No. Crust first. [Jim turns the pizza around] Okay, now the beer. [Jim shakes his head no] Beer me Jim. [Jim quickly puts the beer into his face] Ssss. Gentle. [drinks the beer] Now I’ve gotta go meet Angela.",7,8,113
Dwight," I have a legal obligation to Angela. Okay, she needs to be serviced.",7,8,113
Dwight," Oh come on, stop the fake prissy act. We’re in the real world. Sex contracts exist!",7,8,113
Dwight, You ever been with the blondes before? It’s the big leagues.,7,8,113
Dwight, She’s in heat. She will eat your face off!,7,8,113
Dwight, [to Jim] A single piece of pepperoni please.,7,8,113
Dwight," Try zero, Zero, Zero, Zero, zero, zero.",7,9,114
Dwight," Okay, now try Zero, Zero, Zero, Zero, zero, one.",7,9,114
Dwight," [out in the parking lot with a guy unloading hay bales while Dwight sifts through the hay] Ah, this is good hay. Yeah. This is the good stuff, mattress quality.",7,9,114
Dwight," Every fall, my Uncle Eldred used to build us a maze out of hay bales for us kids to play in. We called it “Hay Place”. Eldred Called it “Hay World”. Eventually lawyers were brought in. But that’s all behind us. Hay Place lives on! [guy comes and sticks a Bale of Hay right behing Dwight and knocks it into Dwight] Watch it, watch it.  ",7,9,114
Dwight, Hello! Welcome to Hay Place! A place for hay. ,7,9,114
Dwight," Oh, and the Petting Zoo closes at 2:00, and the Goat Roast is at 3:00. Come on in, enjoy!",7,9,114
Dwight," Yes, why don’t we meet at the usual spot. [looks at his watch] Uh… I’ve got a half an hour during lunch in-between the historical reenactment of the dunmore farm slaughters and the onion boil. ",7,9,114
Dwight," So, uh… [notices a kid walking on a bale of hay] Excuse me, get off of there! Those are show bales, not play bales.   ",7,9,114
Dwight," [hits the back of a Dunder-Mifflin Delivery Truck with his hand] Hey kids, was that fun?",7,9,114
Dwight," Oh, I bet you do. You know what? When I was a little kid, they couldn’t get me off the hayride! But it’s gonna cost you three more bucks. [kid gives him three more bucks]  ",7,9,114
Dwight," Wow! This brings back memories. Hay stacking, hay throwing… and at the end of it all, one lucky boy would be crowned Hay King. I always wanted to be Hay King. The world shines on Mose.  ",7,9,114
Dwight," Uh, can we move this to the end of the day?",7,9,114
Dwight," Hey, congratulations! Do you know what your prize is?",7,9,114
Dwight, Nothing. Life Lesson? Some tasks are not worth doing.,7,9,114
Dwight," And now, by show of applause, We will crown this year’s hay king. All in favor of Purebred. [crowd applauds] Put your hands together for… Mixed Bread. [crowd applauds] And let’s hear it for… Purebred. [crowd applauds] Mm. It appears we have a three-way tie. I have no choice but to pick the Hay King myself. I pick… [all three contestants begging for Dwight to pick them] Me! I am your Hay King! All Hail your Hay King! [drowd leaves disgusted, as Dwight’s worker claps]  ",7,9,114
Dwight, Did I truck 300 bales of hay to a parking lot to rectify some childhood disappointment? Yes.  ,7,9,114
Dwight," Angela? [slides open the door] Angela! [see’s a note on the door, reads it, and then crumples it up]  ",7,9,114
Dwight," Twenty minutes a day Jim, that’s all it takes. Twenty minutes a day, all feet, no hands and I’ll have the pedi-dexterity of a chimp, and you’ll be sitting there like an idiot. [attempts to place pencil in pencil sharpener] Okay. Here we go. Ah, yes. [accidentally kicks items from his desk onto Pam’s]",7,10,115
Dwight," I’m sorry Pam, allow me to write you an apology letter.",7,10,115
Dwight," [typing with his toes] D-E-A. Oop, backspace. A. Dear.",7,10,115
Dwight," [spills hot coffee on himself] Uhh, aah!",7,10,115
Dwight," Owning a building is a war between the landlord and the tenant. Not a literal war, unfortunately, but I am using the same tactics. I’ve surrounded the enemy, and I’m slowly starving them. To save on electricity I’ve installed a timer and motion sensors on the lights. It’s part of my green initiative. And by green, I mean money.  				",7,10,115
Dwight," I’m sorry, isn’t that good enough for your anus? Don’t get me started on how coddled the modern anus is.",7,10,115
Dwight," Stanley, as a fellow Dunder Mifflin employee I feel for you. But, like you, I am completely powerless to the whims of the new building owner.",7,10,115
Dwight," Pam, when I’m sitting at this desk, I’m a salesman. If you wanna talk to the new building owner, you should call Nate and schedule and appointment.",7,10,115
Dwight," Well then you’re not going to talk to the new building owner. Which is a shame, because I hear he’s a very reasonable guy.",7,10,115
Dwight," [answers phone] Dwight Schrute. Mhm. Tell her I’m busy. I don’t know, make something up.",7,10,115
Dwight," You know what Pam? You’re right. This isn’t just a business. This is a home, and I would much rather see a smile from Kevin than save hundreds on plumbing and electricity. [Kevin smiles]  				",7,10,115
Dwight," I say we bomb ’em. By 2020, they’re gonna be the world’s largest economy and they’re getting a taste for protein. We’ll all starve.",7,10,115
Dwight, Or else? Or else what? There’s nothing you can do.,7,10,115
Dwight," In your perfect would, what would make this building awesome? I’m putting together kind of a wish list.",7,10,115
Dwight," Yeah, no. I’m not a genie. I’m just talking about a…",7,10,115
Dwight," Pam, I am not an unreasonable man. If you guys stay, I will stop watering down the soap.",7,10,115
Dwight, Why do you even need soap? Are you that bad at going to the bathroom?,7,10,115
Dwight," You don’t wanna move. Moving is one of the most stressful things you can do in life. You’ll probably just take it out on your kid. Jim will turn to the drink. The family will fall apart, and twenty five years from now, Cece will become world famous…  for stripping.",7,10,115
Dwight," Here it is, right here, pull over. Oh my God. No way. Man, look at that.",7,10,115
Dwight, There’s no building. This could only mean one thing.,7,10,115
Dwight, I’m sorry. We have a colleague with the same name.,7,10,115
Dwight," So, okay. You’re not a liar too are you?",7,10,115
Dwight," Damn it, Pam. Get out. Right now. Leave it, I mean it. Get the hell out of here. Go.",7,10,115
Dwight," I can’t wait to do to Pam, what I just did… to Pam.  				",7,10,115
Dwight," Y’know what, I’m the only one here who you haven’t asked about the new office.",7,10,115
Dwight," Yeah, but I’m still an employee here, and that part of me is really excited about the change of scenery. What’s the square footage in the new place?",7,10,115
Dwight, How many offices are there? Oh I’ll just look at the one sheet myself.,7,10,115
Dwight," [chuckles] You’re a funny guy Pam. What’s the first thing you guys are gonna do when you move in to the new office? I’m going to walk down the hall and say “Wow, I can’t believe this is real, but it is.” I can’t wait.",7,10,115
Dwight," I see I’ve underestimated you, and I didn’t think that was possible. Nate, reply the paper.",7,10,115
Dwight," They say the best vampires don’t bleed their victims dry, but give them the strength so that they can bounce back only to be fed on again. I spared Pam, and I may feast off of her profits for years to come. I let Pam win. Haha, oh. I was not motivated by compassion. I have no compassion. Make sure you got that. Not motivated by compassion.  				",7,10,115
Dwight," I’ll tell you who. Darryl, Phyllis, Stanley, Angela, and Oscar.",7,11,116
Dwight," Let me see you jump. [Phyllis barely jumps] Oh, my God. This is a store bought-camera. This isn’t one of those special military-grade cameras that would be able to capture that.",7,11,116
Dwight," [mocking] Oh, my God! It’s the first snowfall of Christmas. Is that just so magical for you, little girl? Can you not wait to have a hot chocolate, and cuddle up with Papa and tell him about all your Christmas dreams, hmm? It’s not even a real snow. Look, it’s a dusting. Pitiful.",7,11,116
Dwight," Damn it, Jim, you cannot throw snowballs in here!",7,11,116
Dwight, Look at that. There’s a pebble in there. You coulda killed me.,7,11,116
Dwight," Very well, then I challenge you to a snowball fight on the first real snow of winter.",7,11,116
Dwight," No, Andy, it’s a snowball fight. It’s not fun. Go get your own thing. Beat it. [Jim continues to shake Dwight’s hand] Jim, let go. Let go.  				",7,11,116
Dwight, Is it the middle school teacher who tried to turn her foreign exchange student into a sex slave?,7,11,116
Dwight, [voicemail recording] You’ve reached the voice mail of Dwight Kurt Schrute. Please leave… [Jim hangs up and turns for the door. It is pad locked. Jim turns as Dwight springs from a nearby snowman and pelts him with snowballs.],7,11,116
Dwight, I have no feeling in my fingers or penis. But I think it was worth it.  				,7,11,116
Dwight," [dumps the remainder of the snow in his bag on Jim, then rests his foot on Jim and raises his arms in the air] Haahh!! [runs off]  				",7,11,116
Dwight, [turns in Pam’s chair with a Pam wig on and laughs maniacally],7,11,116
Dwight," Yes, I have a wig for every single person in the office. You never know when your gonna need to bear a passing resemblance to someone.  				",7,11,116
Dwight, I could not agree more. And just want to state for the record that I am intending to sue Jim for acute psychological distress.,7,11,116
Dwight," With snowballs, Jim? With fluffy little snowballs? No. I thought we were just playing.",7,11,116
Dwight, I find that unlikely. You email me when you get a new zit.,7,11,116
Dwight," Didn’t think your affectionate nicknames would be your undoing, did you, Jim? Let that be a lesson to you all.  				",7,11,116
Dwight, I do not accept your surrender. There’s only one way that I would ever relent.,7,11,116
Dwight, You hit Pam in the face with a snowball while I watch.,7,11,116
Dwight," In the end, the greatest snowball isn’t a snowball at all. It’s fear. Merry Christmas.  				",7,11,116
Dwight, This meeting is for Knights of the Night only.  				,7,12,117
Dwight," Knights of the Night are volunteer crime patrollers. We’re often compared to the Guardian Angels, but we could not be more different from them. Seriously, we are nothing like the Guardian Angels. I mean, broad strokes purposes, sure. Think Guardian Angels.  One of our many recent good deeds? We set out to capture the Scranton Strangler. Mission accomplished. Not by us.  				",7,12,117
Dwight," No, no, no, no, no. I see how this movie ends. You make fun of me, everyone laughs, ha, ha, ha… screw you!",7,12,117
Dwight," What are you going to do now? Are you going to make fun of our leader’s weird voice? Huh? [mimicking the leader’s voice] Dwight, don’t be bothered by the [mumbles]. Over the line, Jim.",7,12,117
Dwight," Fine. Minutes from previous meeting of Knights of the Night. That’s our official name, Jim.",7,12,117
Dwight, Reflective strips were glued to patrol jackets. Knights went outside with flashlights to test them. ,7,12,117
Dwight, Okay. Knights stayed outside to play flashlight tag.,7,12,117
Dwight," Hey, hey, hey. Want me to crank the thermostat up to 90, smoke her out? She can’t keep those mittens on forever.",7,12,117
Dwight, I’ve achieved plenty and there’s no better than the best.,7,12,117
Dwight," Wait, it’s that easy? That’s not a resolution, that’s just… something I want to do. Okay, fine. I can do that… [sticks note card on board, makes trumpet sound] My resolution is… meet a loose woman.",7,12,117
Dwight, I’ll take the entirety of the second floor.  ,7,12,117
Dwight," Yeah, pretty much. But, you know, this place is kinda tapped out, so. Let’s roll.",7,12,117
Dwight, I am not going back until I fulfill my resolution.,7,12,117
Dwight," Come on, why not? I’ve never been in one before. I’m tired of being Mr. Perfect Role Model all the time.",7,12,117
Dwight," Well, we can’t just go back, I mean, we came out to meet women.",7,12,117
Dwight," Chicks fall down, need help getting back up.",7,12,117
Dwight, Strip club. I was looking at the strippers at the strip club.,7,12,117
Dwight, What are some of your small business ideas?,7,13,118
Dwight," That’s great. There’s a big, big future in that. ",7,13,118
Dwight, You promised us whales. These are worms. ,7,13,118
Dwight, We’re no more a team than the people staying in the same hotel are a team.   ,7,13,118
Dwight, So what’s your crazy business pipe dream? ,7,13,118
Dwight," Hey, friend. How’s it going? Oh, you know what? Let me steep that for you. ",7,13,118
Dwight," Hey, you know what? Good news. We’re back in. Let’s go sell some paper, Buddy. Huh? ",7,13,118
Dwight, Andy. I didn’t think you had it in ya. ,7,13,118
Dwight," Problem solved everyone. Space Orphan and Princess Nincompoop are off to rescue Michael. Unbelievable. I’m going. You drive, I got a car full of fox meat.    ",7,14,119
Dwight, Male. Caucasian. Forties. Black hair. Facial type:,7,14,119
Dwight," Hey hey hey. Let me answer this. Stupid question. He went back to the office, obviously, which is that way. ",7,14,119
Dwight, Alright. Don’t get a swelled head. You’re no tracker.  [Dwight and Erin low-five] Let’s ride.   ,7,14,119
Dwight, This is a man-hunt slash rescue mission.,7,14,119
Dwight," Pam, I’m obviously going to get that stuff for you so just shut up. ",7,14,119
Dwight, There’s too many brands. Where’s Holly?,7,14,119
Dwight," Of course. He was here. She’s the key. Amazing. Holly. Hey, where you would you like to go next? Holly?",7,14,119
Dwight," Excuse me Do you speak English? We are looking for a man. Michael, this tall, black hair, Caucasian… ",7,14,119
Dwight," Uncanny. Put a pin in that. [to waiter] Which way did he go? That guy! When he leave here, which way did he go? We looking for him. [pointing] This way, this way, this way? I don’t know. Do you know?",7,14,119
Dwight," Do you see a little clown that you want to follow, huh? Is there a little bird that’s chirping to you, “this way, this way”?",7,14,119
Dwight," Okay, close your eyes, we need you to think. What is Michael seeing right now? Can you tell him that we miss him? Michael we’re coming for you! ",7,14,119
Dwight, All right then. Someone propose a plan. ,7,14,119
Dwight, That is the stupidest idea I’ve ever heard. No. Tap into your common mind and tell us what he would do next. ,7,14,119
Dwight," Right.  I can do this on my own. I can think like Michael. All right… I’m deep below the ocean’s surface in a submarine. A torpedo’s coming right at me. No. Damn it, that’s just my own imagination.  Maybe he’s bowling.   ",7,14,119
Dwight," Okay, my name is j…j…j…j…j…j…j…j Jim Halpert and I will fax it in to you… under you. I’ll fax it under you. Oh, excuse me. I just p…p…p…p pissed my pants. Not really. I didn’t really. [clears throat] ",7,15,120
Dwight, You’re just filling that out right now. That wasn’t meant for me. I will not be your Valentine. ,7,15,120
Dwight, As has Ryan. As has Kelly. As has Meredith. As has Phyllis. As has Darryl. As has Creed. [Creed smiles and nods] As has Michael and as has Holly. ,7,15,120
Dwight," Michael, that’s absurd. What if two couples want to go at the same time? ",7,15,120
Dwight, And what is the hook-up zone policy on masturbation? ,7,15,120
Dwight, Hey. Hey. Come on. You’re hurting him. ,7,15,120
Dwight, Okay. Shh. Have you talked to her about your feelings? Women really go for that crap. ,7,15,120
Dwight, Good. He loves it. Good. Jump. Jump up and down. ,7,15,120
Dwight," My perfect Valentine’s Day? I’m at home, three cell phones in front of me, fielding desperate calls from people who want to buy one of the 50 restaurant reservations I made over six months ago.   				",7,15,120
Dwight," I play Samuel, Michael Scarn’s robot butler. I wanted Samuel’s voice- [robot impression] to be like this! [normally] But Michael thought that Samuel should be a very advance android, almost indistinguishable from a real person.  ",7,16,121
Dwight, He cut the part where my circuit board malfunctioned! What was the point of spilling the drink on me?  ,7,16,121
Dwight," No no, he’s doing it to catch the president!",7,16,121
Dwight," No. Because you laughed at me. Kevin will be eaten! Pam will be taken slave! Jim will be made a warlord’s gesture. Meredith will do ok. Be assured this day will come. It’s just a matter of time. Could be one month, could be two months.",7,17,122
Dwight, I can see that as a very real possibility.,7,17,122
Dwight, Well there’s a lot of seats in the annex.,7,17,122
Dwight," I have been sitting here for ten years, Michael.",7,17,122
Dwight," [in the annex, moving into his new desk. Holds up a red tray with rocks on it] Hey, who’s dirt box is this?",7,17,122
Dwight," What do you grow in here, bullcrap? [puts the tray into the garbage]",7,17,122
Dwight," Kevin, in sumo culture, you’d be considered a promising up and comer.  				",7,17,122
Dwight," [walks towards Todd] Hey Packer, I made you some hot chocolate.",7,17,122
Dwight, ‘Cause I wanna let bygones be bygones. Show you I’m cool. You’re the new guy. It’s cold out. I made too much. I got this awesome hot chocolate recipe from my wife.,7,17,122
Dwight," It wasn’t poison Jim, it was a laxative. People take laxatives all the time. This is just, a lot more of a laxative. Let me handle this.",7,17,122
Dwight, [mocking] Ooh does Edgar Allan Poe know about that one? So sinister! That wouldn’t annoy a person at all! Where do you come up with this stuff?,7,17,122
Dwight, Why don’t you write up your best forty ideas and e-mail them to me. Can you do that?,7,17,122
Dwight," Yeah, write up your list of one hundred, edit it down to your top forty, then e-mail it to me, and I’ll read it over.  				",7,17,122
Dwight," [to Jim, the two are alone in the annex] There are over four hundred of these! [indicating a packet of paper]",7,17,122
Dwight, They’re all good. So good! Number three:,7,17,122
Dwight," Eat a brog. Maybe it’s because I didn’t understand it. I just had a couple of notes, let me grab a pen. [Dwight tries to open up a drawer on his desk but it only goes out two inches] Damn it. Gah! Just when we were getting going.  				",7,17,122
Dwight, [also In southern accent] And you make sure to get down there and check out that Harry Potter World.,7,17,122
Dwight, Harry Potter World is supposed to be faaantastic!  				,7,17,122
Dwight, Check it out and have a free butterbeer on us. Keep the receipt and we’ll get ya’ back!  ,7,17,122
Dwight," It wasn’t my first choice, Jim had so many better ideas.",7,17,122
Dwight," No, no, no. That is not part of the plan. That is actually anti-what we’re doing.",7,17,122
Dwight, People! Look alive. It’s showtime. Doors open in 3…2…1.,7,18,123
Dwight, It’s good that its cold it will drive business inside.,7,18,123
Dwight," Uh oh, looks like someone’s sign is a little crooked. Uh, looks awful. Need a thumb tack?",7,18,123
Dwight," Schrute’s are farmers by hobby, and traders by trade. Through the art of the swap, I will walk out of this garage sale with the finest item here.  				",7,18,123
Dwight," Come on, its trash, like your sign, unless you have this.",7,18,123
Dwight," Oh, cause there’s a huge line of people waiting in line who want your spinster chotskies.",7,18,123
Dwight, People like Ryan? Let me tell you about men like him. He comes over and you’re like ‘Hey baby let me light a candle’ then you pull out this one half used and he’s like ‘Uh! Who else is she seeing? I better lock her down fast.’,7,18,123
Dwight, And the Jennifer Weiner collection.  				,7,18,123

Dwight," Oh, its just Stanley’s old photo album. I’m thinking about throwing it in the garbage. I mean, why would I want some random black mans old photo album on my bookshelf. I’m not James Franco.   				",7,18,123
Dwight, things are going very well. I traded a thumb tack for Meredith’s junk for Kelly’s crap for Phyllis’ garbage for Oscars trash for Stanley’s garbage for Ryan’s junk for Creed’s garbage for a very cute squid that Erin happened to have.  				,7,18,123
Dwight," just out of curiosity, what were the claims for those beans?",7,18,123
Dwight, I know right…[sees Jim’s beans] what the?,7,18,123
Dwight," I started with a thumb tack and traded my way to a telescope. But in a way the most valuable thing here wasn’t the telescope at all. No, it was this… packet of beans.  So I traded the telescope for it. And I can just go buy another telescope.  				",7,18,123
Dwight, Did I want to be made manager? Sure. A great opportunity squandered? Absolutely. A crushing blow? Yes. Will I get over it? No. But life goes on. Not for me.  				,7,19,124
Dwight," There’s no turtle, Michael. I just wanted to get you here.",7,19,124
Dwight," That’s because I’m your right-hand man, Michael, but I can’t do it again. I can’t do it again for a whole new guy. ",7,19,124
Dwight," I want to be manager. I just don’t understand why I wasn’t even interviewed for the job. What’s wrong? I was totally qualified, you were pushing for me.  				",7,19,124
Dwight, Can’t you just use the recommendation you already have on file?,7,19,124
Dwight, From when he recommended me to replace him.,7,19,124
Dwight," Correction. Just you. Alright, meeting. Multi-function room. ",7,19,124

Dwight," Ladies and gentlemen, please stand up for you co-host this evening, Michael Gary Scott.

Dwight," Excuse me, can I get a photo of the Best Mom and the Best Dad please?",7,20,125
Dwight, We should just wait here and not get good seats in the conference room?,7,20,125
Dwight, I thought it was the worst Dundies I’ve ever been to.,7,20,125
Dwight," Gladly! I’d accept that award, because a bitch, is a female dog!",7,20,125
Dwight," I just don’t see a point in the Dundies! Okay? The jokes are terrible, the venue is bad, the fashion is boring.",7,20,125
Dwight," And next time, why don’t you pick a co-host, that doesn’t have microphone-a-phobia!",7,20,125
Dwight," Colorado specialty, Rocky Mountain Oysters.",7,21,126
Dwight," [angrily] That’s because they’re Not oysters, they’re bull testicles! I cut them off fresh this morning! [Michael spits it out] Hah!",7,21,126
Dwight, What is wrong with you? I’m the sick freak? After what you did? You expect to be buttled? You didn’t recommend me?!,7,21,126
Dwight, Where did you hear that? Obvious XM Radio?,7,21,126
Dwight, Especially if you think that life would be better without Legs!,7,21,126
Dwight," Black Bears can smell a salami at five miles Michael, what are you thinking?! And they run faster than a horse, so if you were thinking about outrunning one on a horse I would try a cheetah. You, in tight pants, Michael, are a salami to a Black Bear. Do you understand? [Michael nods in agreement] You’re like a giant walking salami!",7,21,126
Dwight, Any kind of meat that you can possibly name!,7,21,126
Dwight, I’ve given up expecting Michael to do the right thing. Or the decent thing. Or even the comprehensible thing.  				,7,21,126
Dwight," This is gonna be good. [eagerly reading the letter] To whom it may concern. [off to the side] Good, real personal. Thanks Michael. [reading again] The dictionary defines superlative as:",7,21,126
Dwight," [opening his trunk excitedly and gets out his paintball gear, takes his gun and looks for Michael, gives up, Michael jumps out of the dumpster shooting, they shoot each other, yell, laugh, and taunt, having a great time]  				",7,21,126

Dwight, I think you’ll find what you’re looking for [points toward Oscar] over there.  				,7,22,127
Dwight, Congratulations on your one cousin.  I have seventy.  Each one better than the last.,7,22,127
Dwight," I’m just not a suck-up like everyone else around here.  Okay?  I do my job well, so why don’t you just leave me alone and let me do it.  Okay?",7,22,127
Dwight," What’s the argument here?  NBA, WNBA.  One is a sport, one is a joke.  I love sports, I love jokes.  Room for all.",7,22,127
Dwight, [holds up phone and looks into Deangelo’s office] No!,7,22,127
Dwight," So, he kicked you out of the inner circle, huh?",7,22,127
Dwight," Deangelo, tell your whore to leave me alone.  				",7,22,127
Dwight," Pass.  If I wanted to see a pissing contest, I’d lock Mose in the chicken coop.",7,22,127
Dwight," Okay, a little about me.  I respond to strong leadership.  				",7,22,127
Dwight," Wait, wait. All in favor of the knapsack filled with canned goods, chainsaw, gasoline, and emergency radio in case he wakes up post-apocalypse? [Dwight raises his hand]",7,23,128
Dwight," [on phone] Dwight Schrute. Yes, I would. Thank you. [hangs up] Jordan, gather my things from my desk. [Dwight walks to the manager’s office, rubs the door frame, sits at the desk reverently]",7,23,128
Dwight," Excellent. Morning announcements! There’s been a problem with some people sharing copier codes. Your copier code is a distinct 21-digit number that is unique to you, and you only, okay? Don’t share it. [Kevin looks exasperated] Jo Bennett, our CEO, will be here today for a high-level meeting involving Gabe and myself. ",7,23,128
Dwight," [quietly] General meet-and-greet. So I expect you to be on your best behavior, which means none of you will be insubordinate, nor will you foment insurrection.",7,23,128
Dwight, [clears throat] Please take note of the new color-coding system.  				,7,23,128
Dwight," All right. You stop me when I reach the diseased area. [Dwight points to her legs and slowly moves his finger up, stopping at her mid-section]  				",7,23,128
Dwight," [seeing the Join the Fist flyers that Jim is hanging] Hey, hey, hey, hey. What do you think you’re doing? What’s this? What’s the Fist?",7,23,128
Dwight, You expect me to believe that you’re starting a rebellion?,7,23,128
Dwight," Okay, you know what? I would love to join The Fist. ",7,23,128
Dwight, I will never be happier than I am right now. I will also never be less happy. I will be at my current maximum happiness for the rest of my life. Because I am manager of the Scranton Branch of Dunder Mifflin. Acting Manager.  				,7,23,128
Dwight," Ah, Jim, Jim, Jim. The gun is a Beaumont-Adams. Jo collects them. I thought we could have some nice small talk about it. And the piranha’s a rescue. ",7,23,128
Dwight," The desk is a replica of Uday Hussein’s desk. I saw a picture in Newsweek. Listen, I’m a very busy man. Let’s get right down to business. ",7,23,128
Dwight, Jo is coming later today. I cannot have a subordinate trying to make me look stupid. Okay? I need you to promise me that you’ll be on your best behavior.,7,23,128
Dwight," Watch this. You’re pre-fired. And when I’m promoted, you’ll be full fired. ",7,23,128
Dwight," Everyone here thinks that you’re a joke. They think that you were hired because of your good looks, which won’t last long anyway. As your pale skin and severe bone structure imply, you’ll age swiftly and poorly. ",7,23,128
Dwight," Now I want you to find out what people are saying about me, things they don’t want me to know abou-[Dwight opens a box and sits down in shock] Ohh… it’s a holster.   				",7,23,128
Dwight," [walking around the office with the holster around his waist] Yep. Yep, yep, yep. Lookin’ good. [grunts] Ohh… [stretching out his arms to better indicate the gun and holster] Oh, what a day. What a day. ",7,23,128
Dwight," The holster was a gift from my great-uncle Honk. Um, I don’t know. I guess he’s saying that he’s proud of me. ",7,23,128
Dwight," The gun is just an accessory to the holster, okay? I can’t walk around wearing an empty holster. ",7,23,128
Dwight, Why do you need to keep wearing those booby shirts all the time?,7,23,128
Dwight, Uh… hello! [indicates his phone clipped onto his belt],7,23,128
Dwight, Why would I put a banana in my holster? ,7,23,128
Dwight," Okay. All right. Fine. Everyone calm down. Someone get me a banana. Sorry I freaked you guys out – aah! [Dwight goes to flip the gun and it fires near Andy’s ear, making everyone jump]",7,23,128
Dwight," No, no, no. All we know is that a gun fired. That’s all we know! No. That’s not true. Actually, we heard a loud noise. Later, a hole was seen. No one saw the bullet leave the gun. ",7,23,128
Dwight," Okay, everyone! Conference room, right now!  				",7,23,128
Dwight," [enters with a cowboy hat, speaking with a Western accent] Yee-haw! Whoo-hoo! [imitates gunfire] Howdy, partners! It’s me, Gun-Safety Dwight! And I’m the rootin’-est– [removes hat] I can’t do this. Um, look. Obviously, a gun went off under my watch, and I’m launching a full investigation.",7,23,128
Dwight, Really? You did? What hand was I holding the gun in? What did Andy’s tie look like?,7,23,128
Dwight, I have no way of knowing if that’s true. ,7,23,128
Dwight," I just really, really think we should handle this internally. ",7,23,128
Dwight," Because you guys are my best friends, and I mean that. Managing you for this last week has been the greatest honor of my life. And if you ruin this, I will burn this office to the ground. And I mean that figuratively. Not literally. Because you guys are so… so important… to me. I love you guys. But don’t cross me. But you’re the best.   				",7,23,128
Dwight," There he is! Our hero! [Both Dwight and Erin move to hug Andy] You look fantastic. How you doing? Here, tell us your war stories.",7,23,128
Dwight, Did they say what caused it? Because I know you like putting Q-tips deep into your ear canal. ,7,23,128
Dwight," Okay, fine. You can go on your singing audition. ",7,23,128
Dwight, I put everything back in the vending machine. ,7,23,128

Dwight," [does jazz hands, Jo notices and eyes him oddly] Well, what can you do? Life.  				",7,23,128
Dwight," Oscar, can you print out last year’s sale statements?",7,23,128
Dwight," Okay, okay. Shh! [Dwight begins rubbing his shoulders]",7,23,128
Dwight," You’re kidding me. [reaches under Kevin’s jacket] Oh God, what am I touching? It’s moist. ",7,23,128
Dwight, Jo… I accidentally fired a gun in the office today. ,7,23,128
Dwight," I am telling you this because I care too much about this job to be blackmailed into doing it poorly. All I’ve ever wanted was to be manager here. And if you feel that you cannot promote me over this one accident, I understand. But if you think that extortion is worse –",7,23,128
Dwight," It was a Beaumont-Adams, if that helps.",7,23,128
Dwight, Pam made me put a banana in my holster.,7,23,128
Dwight, Okay. Did I make a mistake? Yes. Do I regret the decision that I made? Yes. ,7,23,128
Dwight," [on the verge of tears] Jo, please… I will –",7,23,128
Dwight,"  They won’t make me manager, and I won’t settle for anything less. I’ve gone about as far as I can here. That’s obvious. Time to take my talents elsewhere.",7,24,129
Dwight,  Bread is the paper of the food industry. You write your sandwich on it.  				,7,24,129
Dwight,  What makes you feel qualified to judge a place after a mere interview? [Robert stares at Dwight] What are you doing..? [Dwight sits up abruptly] Stop trying to figure me out.,7,24,129
Dwight,  Stop trying to figure me out. [Robert turns to ignore Dwight] Do you even know anything about paper? How it’s made?,7,24,129
Dwight,"  I’m gonna prevent inferior men from sullying my place of work with their weak, passionless leadership. Do you see my hat? No? That’s because I just threw it in the ring.  				",7,24,129
Dwight,"  [comes in, slapping some papers on the table] I want an interview.  				",7,24,129
Dwight,  [walking with Jim in the parking lot] How’s the family?,7,24,129
Dwight,  What’s your daughter’s name again? Peepee?,7,24,129
Dwight,"  Great! Oh, that’s great… We never were very good at small talk, were we, Jim?",7,24,129
Dwight,"  Okay, I know why you’re saying that, Jim, I really do, but think of it this way. The hand that reaches from the grave to grip your throat [motions to grip Jim’s throat] is the strong hand you want on the wheel.",7,24,129
Dwight,"  I’m going to make you an offer. Okay? You even do so little as grant me an interview, I will guarantee you your dream work life. Okay? You roll in at 10 a.m. to your own private reserved parking spot, pick up your daily free coffee from Dwight’s Caffeine Corner, unlimited sex breaks for you and Pam…",7,24,129
Dwight,  Erin will eat garbage for your entertainment.,7,24,129
Dwight,"  Fine. I’ll do it without you, but you’ll regret this.",7,24,129
Dwight,  Let me get that for you. [runs ahead to open the door for Jim],7,24,129
Dwight,"  [clears throat] Jo, may I speak to you for a second?",7,24,129
Dwight,"  Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ohh, I enjoy laughing at my mistakes, because I’ve learned so much from them. I’d like to be interviewed for the position.",7,24,129
Dwight,  [mumbling through the gauze] Assistant Regional Manager.,7,24,129
Dwight,  [in a cheesy French accent] Assistant Regional Manager.,7,24,129
Dwight,  Uhh. Wait. Wait! No. Stop! Stop. Jo… [takes off sunglasses and reveals his face] It’s me. I’m Dwight.,7,24,129
Dwight,"  I would have dressed this way every day, legally changed my name, learned French sign language, shown up, and been the best damn branch manager you’d ever seen!",7,24,129
Dwight,"  Okay! If you’re not going to interview me, then I’ll do it.",7,24,129
Dwight,"  What will be your first priority? I will have seven first priorities. Safety, profits, fostering a community of self-reliance and entrepreneurship, listening, respect for human life, bolstering our public image, and… [chuckles] getting everyone home on time. Dwight, let me be frank. In an accident that no one can blame you for, an antique gun was discharged while you were acting manager. How are we ever to trust you again? [whispering] That’s a great question. [Jim nods] I am going to institute a strict no-firearms policy for this office that extends to myself as well. Wow. All of my concerns are disappearing.",7,24,129
Dwight,"  Thank you. [clears throat and gets up] You’ll be hearing from us shortly, Mr. Schrute, and I think you’re gonna like the call you’re going to receive. [smiles] Oh, come on. I’m just happy that I got this meeting. [leaves]",7,24,129
Dwight,"  Well, it’s not entirely up to you, is it? Seems to me like someone’s getting a little power-mad.",7,24,129
Dwight,  What a surprise! Minorities sticking together.,7,24,129
Dwight,"  We’re gonna miss you, Gabe. [Gabe leaves]",7,24,129
Dwight,"  I will run this branch, or I will destroy this branch, or… [shrugs] I don’t know. Something always works out. [leaves]  				",7,24,129
Jim," Oh, I told you. I couldn’t close it. So…",1,1,1
Jim," Actually, you called me in here, but yeah.",1,1,1
Jim," My job is to speak to clients on the phone about… uh, quantities and type of copier paper. You know, whether we can supply it to them. Whether they can pay for it. And… I’m boring myself just talking about this.  					",1,1,1
Jim, Whassup! I still love that after seven years.,1,1,1
Jim," Sure. Mr. Davis, let me call you right back. Yeah, something just came up. Two minutes. Thank you very much. Dwight, what are you doing?",1,1,1
Jim, [crosses fingers] We’ll see. [Dwight begins smashing pencils with his phone] This is why the whole downsizing thing just doesn’t bother me.,1,1,1
Jim," If I left, what would I do with all this useless information in my head? You know? Tonnage price of manila folders? Um, Pam’s favorite flavor of yogurt, which is mixed berry.  					",1,1,1
Jim," OK. Dwight, I’m sorry, because I have always been your biggest flan.",1,1,1
Jim, Do you like going out at the end of the week for a drink?,1,1,1
Jim, That’s why we’re all going out. So we can have an end-of-the-week-drink.,1,1,1
Jim, You know what? You should come with us. Because you know we’re all going out and it could be a good chance for you to see what people are like outside the office. I think it could be fun.,1,1,1
Jim," No, definitely. All right, dude. Awesome. Will do.  					",1,1,1
Jim, Do I think I’ll be invited to the wedding? [scratches head]  					,1,1,1
Jim," Oh no, I just decided not to. How’s your headache?",1,1,1
Jim," Yeah, definitely. You too. Enjoy it. [looks at camera] You know what, just come here.  					",1,1,1
Jim," That’s the thing. It’s very sturdy paper and on the back it says, “100% post-consumer content.” What? Hello? Uh-huh. Wait. What? I’m sorry, Mr. Decker. I think I’m losing you. [Shedder whirring] Hello? Hello? Yeah. Hold on one second. I don’t know. Hold on one second.",1,2,2
Jim, Do you really have to do that right now?,1,2,2
Jim," Mr. Decker, I’m sorry about that. What were you… Can you hold on one second? Yeah, just one second. Thanks. [Power off, silence] Hello? That’s it. Perfect. So what I was saying… [Dialing tone] Hello? Thanks, Dwight.",1,2,2
Jim," This is my biggest sale of the year. They love me over there for some reason. I’m not really sure why but I make one call over there every year, just to renew their account, and that one call ends up being 25% of my commission for the whole year, so I buy a mini bottle of champagne, celebrate a little. And this year I’m pushing recycled paper on them for one percent more. I know. I’m getting cocky. Right?  				",1,2,2
Jim, You know what? I’m actually going to have to call you back. Thank you. Sorry about that.  				,1,2,2
Jim," Yeah, hi. Is Mr. Decker around? Oh, well, could you just have him call me after lunch? Thank you.",1,2,2
Jim," [on the phone] Mr. Decker, we didn’t lose your sale today, did we? Excellent. OK. Let me just get your… what’s that? No, we didn’t close last time. I just need your… Oh.

Jim," [Pam is asleep, resting her head on Jim’s shoulder] Um… Hey.",1,2,2
Jim," Last night on Trading Spouses, there’s… have you seen it?",1,3,3
Jim, Wow. But then who would watch my TV? That is…,1,3,3
Jim, That is a great offer. Thank you. I really think I should be concentrating on sales.,1,3,3
Jim," Yeah. I just don’t think this is the kind of task, that I… am going to do. You know who would be great for this?  				",1,3,3
Jim," Any time Michael asks me to do anything, I just tell him that Dwight should do it.  				",1,3,3
Jim," Right now, this is just a job. If I advance any higher in this company then this would be my career. And uh, well, if this were my career, I’d have to throw myself in front of a train.  				",1,3,3
Jim," If it’s the same thing, then why did you write “workspace”?",1,3,3
Jim," You cut more than you had to, didn’t you?",1,3,3
Jim," Well, why did you do that? You work here, don’t you want good insurance?",1,3,3
Jim," OK, well, if you’ve never been sick, then you don’t have any antibodies.",1,3,3
Jim," OK, you know what Dwight? We can’t write our diseases down for you because that’s confidential.",1,3,3
Jim, Wait. What are you writing? Don’t write Ebola or mad cow disease. Right? ‘Cause I’m suffering from both.,1,3,3
Jim, I thought you said you were inventing diseases? That’s spontaneous dental hydroplosion.,1,3,3
Jim," OK, whoa. ‘Cause that is a pretty intense accusation. How do you know that they’re fake?",1,3,3
Jim," OK, can you hold on? I’m getting the, ah, beep. [presses button on phone]] Jim Halpert.",1,3,3
Jim, I’m doing OK. Getting excited for the weekend though. What are you up to?,1,3,3
Jim," Oh, interesting, what kind of shoes?  				",1,3,3
Jim," At that moment, I was so happy. I mean, everything Dwight does annoys me.  				",1,4,4
Jim," And I spend hours thinking of ways to get back at him, but only in ways that could get me arrested. And then here he comes and he says “No, Jim, here’s a way.”  				",1,4,4
Jim," I think it has something to do with Survivor, but I’m not sure.",1,4,4
Jim," Um, I know that it involves spying on people and we may build a fort, underground.",1,4,4
Jim," What? Oh no no no. Dwight, no. I’m using her, for the alliance. Who knows the most information about this office? Pam.",1,4,4
Jim, Well I’m trying to. Do you see what I’m doing?,1,4,4
Jim," But listen, I’m going to have to talk to her a lot. All right? And there may be chatting, and giggling. And you gotta just pretend to ignore it. Wipe it away.",1,4,4
Jim," Well, tensions were high in the kitchen.",1,4,4
Jim," Hey Kev, that looks good. What is it? Turkey?",1,4,4
Jim," Oh, Italian. Nice. Wow! You got the works there. Red onion, provolone…",1,4,4
Jim," Toby and Kevin, they’re trying to get Angela kicked off.",1,4,4
Jim," Well, I don’t know, if Kevin’s in accounting, and Toby’s in Human Resources and they’re talking…",1,4,4
Jim," OK, listen, we need to assume that everyone in the office is forming an alliance and is therefore trying to get us kicked off.",1,4,4
Jim," Because we’re strong, Dwight. Because we’re strong.  				",1,4,4
Jim," No, will not, I’m not going to tell anybody. This is between you and me.",1,4,4
Jim, That was beautiful. All her idea too. Awesome. She is so great.  				,1,4,4
Jim," OK, here’s the deal. All right? Pam says that one of the alliances is meeting in the warehouse during Meredith’s birthday.",1,4,4
Jim," I know, but it’s gonna be a little tough because there’s no good place to hide there.",1,4,4
Jim, [gives Dwight a high five] Great.  				,1,4,4
Jim," Wait, this isn’t gonna work. The lid’s open.",1,4,4
Jim, I can’t do that. You won’t be able to breathe.,1,4,4
Jim," So do you want me to stay here and, you know, stand next to the box?",1,4,4
Jim," Pam, he’s in a box. He’s downstairs, in a box, on the floor, near the shelves. I’m serious. Go down there and work your magic.  				",1,4,4
Jim," Speaking of which, I meant to tell you. Very impressive, the uh, donation you gave to Oscar’s charity. What was it? 25 bucks?",1,4,4
Jim," Yeah, well, three dollars a mile. It’s gonna end up being like 50 bucks. So… God, I can’t even calculate what you’re gonna have to give.",1,4,4
Jim," OK, OK. I have something that totally tops the box.",1,4,4
Jim, OK. I have just convinced Dwight that he needs to go to Stamford and… [Pam starts laughing]… spy on our other branch. No no no.,1,4,4
Jim," But before he does so, I told him that he should dye his hair to go undercover.",1,4,4
Jim, If we can get him to drive to Connecticut… and put peroxide in his hair…,1,4,4
Jim," No, dude, no, I was just, listen! Whoa.",1,4,4
Jim," God, I don’t even, I don’t even know how to explain this. Uh, um… Dwight, uh, asked me to be in an alliance. And then um… um… we were… we’ve just been messing with him. Uh, because of the whole alliance thing. Um…",1,4,4
Jim," It’s stupid. It’s, it’s just office pranks.",1,4,4
Jim," God, this is so sad. This is the smallest amount of power I’ve ever seen go to someone’s head. Phyllis, can you believe this?",1,5,5
Jim," Pam gets a little down.  Her toaster oven broke. Um, which she got at her engagement shower. Um, for a wedding that still has yet to be set… and that was three years ago.  				",1,5,5
Jim," I’ll do it. Wear a little flouncey skirt if you want, and…",1,5,5
Jim," Basketball? It was kind of my thing in high school. And I’m, yeah, I’m looking forward to playing. You know, I think I’m gonna impress a few people in here.  				",1,5,5
Jim," Well, I’m going to the outlet mall on Saturday, so if you wanna save big on brand names and Roy has to work, which he will, because I’m also competitive, you should feel free to come along.",1,5,5
Jim, I think I’ll see you at the mall. Yeah.  				,1,5,5
Jim," [to Pam] …so I talked to the scout, it looks good.",1,5,5
Jim," [glances at Pam] Moms, primarily. Yep. Soccer moms. Single moms. NASCAR moms. Any type of moms, really. ",1,6,6
Jim," Pam and I are good buddies.  I’m sort of Pam’s go-to guy for her problems. You know with stuff like work, or uh, her fiance Roy. Or uh… Nope, those are pretty much her only two problems.  				",1,6,6
Jim," So, what? You’re Assistant Regional Manager. ",1,6,6
Jim," Well, you know what Dwight? He’s your work boss, okay? He is not your relationship boss. ",1,6,6
Jim," Plus you have so much more to talk to this girl about, You’re both um, salesmen. I mean that’s something right there. ",1,6,6
Jim," Alright. Here’s the thing okay, you just keep talking to her.  If you hit a stall you have a perfect fall back. ",1,6,6
Jim," Dwight, that’s not necessarily true. Do you read GQ? ",1,6,6
Jim," Okay, I do. There like mini briefcases, alright?  Lots of guys have them. ",1,6,6
Jim," Yes. Listen, you are spending way too much time talking to me, when you could be talking to her. ",1,6,6
Jim, No. You don’t need the bathroom. You’ve got it. Go.   				,1,6,6
Jim," Okay, shhhh stop… stop whatever you’re doing because this is going to be good. ",1,6,6
Jim," [mimicing Dwight in high-falsetto voice] Hi my name’s Dwight Schrute and I would like to buy a purse from you. Good lord, look at these purses! This is something special. Oh my God is this Salvatore Di-chini-asta? ",1,6,6
Jim," Yes, well I want to stress test it. You know, in case anything happens. ",1,6,6
Jim, Oh! That was really. [Dwight hits purse against table] This is necessary to do to really give it a good workout. This is the ooooh… This is the prettiest one of all. ,1,6,6
Jim," I’m going to be the prettiest girl in the ball.  Oh, how much? ",1,6,6
Jim, [gives Dwight a thumbs-up – mouths the word] Good.  ,1,6,6
Jim," That’s sad. Or it’s innovative. Well, you know the futon is a bed and couch all rolled into one. [Jim sees Roy and trails off]",1,6,6
Jim," I do. That’s what I’m best known for. Sitting out there. Alright, let’s talk about purses. ",1,6,6
Jim," Katy but you know what, don’t try to sell me one. Okay, seriously ’cause I’m just here to learn. ",1,6,6
Jim," Okay, so I know about most of these, but you know you can… ",1,6,6
Jim," Oh, man I don’t know. Uh, dinner, drinks, movie, matching tattoos.",1,6,6
Jim," That is cool. Well, I’ll see you Monday though, right? ",1,6,6
Jim, I got this. [taking Katy’s bag from Michael],1,6,6
Jim," Oh, yeah. You sold a lot, so it’s lighter. ",1,6,6
Jim," Alright now, I’m gonna warn you. Don’t freak out, okay?  ",1,6,6
Jim," This is a really nice car. In case you haven’t noticed, this is a Corolla. Okay. ",1,6,6
Jim," Oh, I can’t because I keep them hidden. I don’t want to look at them and get cocky. ",2,1,8
Jim," No, it’s hilarious, you’re right. I just think, um, “world’s longest engagement”, um, we’re all expecting it, you know?",2,1,8
Jim, Well I think if you use the same jokes it just comes across as lazy.,2,1,8
Jim, [Pam starts sipping an empty glass] I think those might be empty.,2,1,8
Jim," Yes, I have not gotten one either. So, keep going.",2,1,8
Jim, What a great year for the Dundies.  					,2,1,8
Jim," We got to see Ping.  [Pam nods] And we learned of Michael’s true feelings for Ryan. [Pam nods] Which was touching. And, we heard Michael change the lyrics to a number of classic songs. [Pam nods] Which for me, has ruined them for life. [looks at Pam, who is staring at him, nodding]",2,1,8
Jim, Did you get that? Please tell me you got that. This is all going to be on.,2,1,8
Jim," Oh, here she is. Careful, careful, whoa. Alright, easy. Almost there.",2,1,8
Jim," Not really a question. [starts to laugh] Okay, let’s get you home, you’re drunk.",2,1,8
Jim," Goodnight, have a good night. Thank you Angela.		  					",2,1,8
Jim, Um… ‘Fifty signs your priest might be Michael Jackson.’,2,2,9
Jim," Hey, um… what has two thumbs and hates Todd Packer? [points at self] This guy!  				",2,2,9
Jim," Yeah. As a child, did Pam show any traits that would hint towards her future career as a receptionist?  				",2,2,9
Jim," I’m in an office relationship. It’s special. Um… she’s nice. She’s shy. She’s actually here. You want to meet her? Hold on one second. Oh, my God! Put on a shirt! Put on a… . I told you that you’d be on camera. I’m sorry, she’s European. No, I told you that you’d be on camera. Stop it.  				",2,2,9
Jim, Does that include ‘That’s What She Said’?,2,2,9
Jim," Wow! That is really hard. You really think you can go all day long? Well, you always left me satisfied and smiling, so… ",2,2,9
Jim, [looks bored. Taps finger on desk. Head falls to desk],2,3,10
Jim, No way. Let’s do this [crumples post it and throws into mug. Misses.] Oh. ,2,3,10
Jim,"  Hey, Oscar, on these new expense reports, do we really have to go back to last quarter?",2,3,10
Jim,  [points at paper on desk] What does 2005 season mean?,2,3,10
Jim,"  Oh my God!  Wait, this goes back two years. ",2,3,10
Jim,  [flicks football onto Kevin’s desk] OH!,2,3,10
Jim,  Yes!  So close.  I really love the paper triangle flicking and hitting things game.  Yeah.,2,3,10
Jim,"  Hey, do you guys have any other games?",2,3,10
Jim, [bounces ball off wall with Toby] So that’s what this sound is all day.   					,2,3,10
Jim," Stanley. Just played Dunder Ball with Toby. What about you, you got any games?",2,3,10
Jim,  [sings Olympic theme song] This scented candle …andle …andle. Which I found in the men’s bathroom …room …room. Represents the eternal burning of competition. Or something. ,2,3,10
Jim,"  Yes it does. Yes it does my friend. Ok, we will be competing for gold, silver and bronze yogurt lids. ",2,3,10
Jim, Let the games begin. [sings Olympic theme]  					,2,3,10
Jim,"  You have what is the national sport of Icelandic paper companies. And I’m blanking on the name, can you help me out Pam?",2,3,10
Jim,"  Fair enough, but I like Flonkerton.   					",2,3,10
Jim,"  So, who will be challenging Kevin in Flonkerton? Anyone?",2,3,10
Jim,"  Yes! Phyllis! [claps] Phyllis, just put your foot right through here [lifts strap on box of paper]. Right through the flonk.   					",2,3,10
Jim,"  Dig deep, dig deep! OHHHhhh! It’s Phyllis!",2,3,10
Jim,  Phyllis by a nose. Gold medal in Flernenton.,2,3,10
Jim,  Wow! Ok. No one else should even try! Gold medals! Give him medals. Wow.  					,2,3,10
Jim,"  Very nicely done. I think that’s H-O-R for Stanley, and H-O for Phyllis. ",2,3,10
Jim,"  Oh my god. Phyllis, coming alive. I like it.   					",2,3,10
Jim,  Who had someone from Vance Refrigeration?,2,3,10
Jim,  Ryan Howard. Ryan! [claps] Gold medal.  					,2,3,10
Jim,  What? [looks in box] Oh my god. Where did you have time to make that?,2,3,10
Jim,"  Alright Pam, alright [gives her hi-five]. Nice work!",2,3,10
Jim,  Final lap. Final lap. Time to beat is 1:15. ,2,3,10
Jim," Time to beat is one minute, 15 seconds. Here they come. [Michael and Dwight enter] Guys?",2,3,10
Jim,  Nothing. Guys? Timer’s still going? Er?,2,3,10
Jim,  [hands expense report to Oscar] Here you go. All done.,2,3,10
Jim,"  Yeah, I filled out the expense reports. That took about five minutes and then I closed two sales at lunch time. So, about as productive as any other day. If not more so.   					",2,3,10
Jim,"  Mmm. Hey, can you ignore those and do something for me instead?",2,3,10
Jim,"  Okay, today. 5 o’clock. Closing Ceremonies.",2,3,10
Jim,  Nothing. I just wanted to congratulate you on your condo. ,2,3,10
Jim,"  Hey, would you mind coming out here for a second? I just have something for you.",2,3,10
Jim,"  These are the Closing Ceremonies. Step up. You’re on the top one.  [Michael stands on podium] Congratulations to Michael, because he closed on his condo. So, gold medal. [everyone claps]",2,3,10
Jim,"  And for Dwight Schrute, the silver medal. ",2,3,10
Jim, So we’re still on for lunch? You’re meeting me here? Okay. Great. Bye. ,2,4,11
Jim," Okay, you know what?  I am going to be, uh, setting the agenda here. Okay? Can everybody gather up, please? Important announcement. Very important announcement. I think this is a perfect opportunity for all of us to participate in some really intense, psychologically revealing conversations. So we’re going to be playing Desert Island, umm, Who Would You Do? ",2,4,11
Jim, Would You Rather. Would You Rather is our third game.   				,2,4,11
Jim," Okay, so… three books on a desert island? Angela. ",2,4,11
Jim, Okay. Thought people read more books.    				,2,4,11
Jim, DVDs! Five movies. What would you bring to the island?  Yes! Meredith? ,2,4,11
Jim," Wow. Bridges of Madison County, Legally Blond, these movies are just… .",2,4,11
Jim," Wait, wait, wait. Pam. No. Do you understand? The… the game is Desert Island Movies, not guilty pleasure movies. Desert Island Movies are the movies you’re going to watch for the rest of your life! Forever! Unforgivable. ",2,4,11
Jim, Play by the rules. Dwight. All time favorite movie.  ,2,4,11
Jim, All right. Let’s move on. Let’s move on to the main event. Who Would You Do? ,2,4,11
Jim," Um… okay. Ah, you know what? Maybe I’ll… I’ll finish explaining the rules. Let’s… let me explain it first, and then… ",2,4,11
Jim," Yeah, so we’ll get right… You know what? I’ll be right back. Stanley, you’re taking over for me, buddy. I’ll be right back. ",2,4,11
Jim," You know what you should do? You should quit. And then, that would stick it to both of them. ",2,4,11
Jim," Um… Kevin, hands down. Yeah. He’s really got that teddy bear thing going on, and afterwards, we could just watch bowling. ",2,4,11
Jim," [on the phone] Hey, where are you? Oh good. Yeah. We’re just here, we’re playing Desert Island. It’s when you pick your five favorite DVDs… ",2,4,11
Jim," Oh! Right! Right, right, right, come-ah on, on, on. [to everyone] Ladies and gentlemen! Gather around! We have one more participant. Come on, be polite. Be polite. [to Katy] Desert Island. Five movies. Go. ",2,4,11
Jim," Okay, I think the game’s over… People are like leaving. There was a bigger crowd last time. Do you just want to go to lunch? ",2,4,11
Jim," I’m a three hole punch version of Jim. ‘Cause you can have me either way. Plain White Jim, or Three-hole Punch.",2,5,12
Jim," Okay, okay. Um, how ’bout, the ultimate team player? [Pam laughs and types]  				",2,5,12
Jim," Dwight is… special. But, I don’t believe that his talents are being used in this office. So Pam and I have put his resume on Monster.com, Google, Craig’s List. We’re really interested most in jobs that take Dwight out of state. Um, preferably Alaska… or India.  				",2,5,12
Jim," Um… Whoa. [picks up ringing phone][in managerial voice] Michael Scott here. Yes, I am regional manager of this orifice. Mmm hmm. Dwight Schrute is amazing. Yeah. No, he is actually the single greatest employee of his generation. Mm  hmm. You know what? I’m gonna tell you what. You hire Dwight K. Schrute, and if he does not meet, nay, exceed every one of your wildest expectations, well then, you can hold me, Michael Gary Scott, personally and financially responsible. Okay. Okay. Okay-kay-kay-kay-kay. Okay.  				",2,5,12
Jim,  Yeah.  Yeah. You know what? Maybe… maybe I will. [starts walking away],2,5,12
Jim," Honestly, I don’t think Michael has the slightest clue of who he’s gonna  fire. I think he keeps hoping that someone’s going to volunteer. Uh, or be run over by a bus before the deadline. But in the end, really, what’s going to happen is it’s gonna be the first person to give him a dirty look in the hall. And therein lies the true essence of his charisma.",2,5,12
Jim," Alright. [they stand up] Excuse me.[They sit down] I’m really sorry, but I have to let you go. And it’s purely budgetary. It’s not personal… ",2,5,12
Jim," Is this you? Are you being you, or is this Creed? Are you…",2,5,12
Jim," Oh, hold that thought. Hold that thought.",2,5,12
Jim, [picks up the phone] Michael Scott here.,2,5,12
Jim," Toby? Mm hmm. [looks back to Michael] I really have to take this Creed, so it was really worth… ",2,5,12
Jim, [motions for her to follow him] Come on.  				,2,5,12
Jim," That’s just a figure of speech, you know? Blow your brains out? Come on. All it really means is that we’re friends. Who else is she gonna talk to if I’m gone, right? I mean, if she left, I wouldn’t blow my brains out. Of course, I would take that job in Maryland. Because it’s double the pay, and soft shell crab just happens to be my favorite food.  				",2,5,12
Jim," Ok, well, you’re the one who lost the desk.",2,6,13
Jim," Okay, calm down.  Where was the last place you saw it?",2,6,13
Jim," Colder… warmer… little warmer… there you go, ooh, warmer… warmer… warmer… warmer… warmer … cold, cold, cold, back up… ooh, ooh, warmer, hot, red hot,  hot, very hot.",2,6,13
Jim," [On the phone with Dwight] Hi, Dwight, um, what sort of discounts are we giving on the 20 lb white model.",2,6,13
Jim," [On the phone] Right, oh let me just check the pricing list.  Hold on one second… ",2,6,13
Jim," You know what, let me give you a call right back. I’m going to uh, find it and then I’ll call you back, thanks.",2,6,13
Jim," Assistant to the Sensei, that’s pretty cool.",2,6,13
Jim," You making this up as you go along, aren’t you?",2,6,13
Jim," Hey, Dwight. As Sempai, do you think there is ever going to be a day where humans and robots can peacefully co-exist?",2,6,13
Jim," Oh, that’s not advice. What advice sounds like is this:",2,6,13
Jim," Good, and it absolutely is a toy. Arigatou. ",2,6,13
Jim, Ok. Michael? Could you beat up Michael? ,2,6,13
Jim," Uh, how did you know they were black belts?",2,6,13
Jim," Sounds tough. When you’re a Jet, [starts snapping] you’re a Jet all the way, right? ",2,6,13
Jim, You know a ton of fourteen year old girls?,2,6,13
Jim, Are you ok? Are you sure you are alright?,2,6,13
Jim," Ok, he has to be stopped. Please, please, please, please, just ask Michael.",2,6,13
Jim," Um, well, we are all getting excited to see this fight. The Albany branch is working right through lunch to prevent downsizing, but Michael, he decided to extend our lunch by an hour so we could all go down to the dojo and watch him fight Dwight. Fight… Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, I’m coming, fight…   					",2,6,13
Jim," [Reading Pam’s palm, while she has on extremely padded gloves] Wow, that is really interesting. ",2,6,13
Jim, Your love line- I’m just kidding. I can’t see anything. ,2,6,13
Jim," [Jim moves his head closer and Pam taps him gently in the face] Oh, ok. ",2,6,13
Jim, [Gently taps Pam on the forehead] Tied up.,2,6,13
Jim," What, what are you going to do? Bring it, Beesley. Bring it. Oh yeah, good move. Not such an ultimate fighter now. ",2,6,13
Jim," Later, Kev. [Puts French Onion Potato Chips on Pam’s desk] Have a good weekend.",2,6,13
Jim," So this possible client they’re talking about, actually a big deal.  It’s Lackawanna County.  Our whole county.  And if we get this, they may not have to downsize our branch.  And I could work here for years.  And years.  [groan] Years.  ",2,7,14
Jim," I always knew Pam has refused to go to sports games with Roy, but I never knew why.  Interesting.   ",2,7,14
Jim, Is this real? [Pam dumps Michael’s screenplay on Jim’s desk],2,7,14
Jim," How long is this? [flips through pages]  Oh, Pam. Good work! Oop, wait, stop.  Drawings.",2,7,14
Jim," Oh, those are drawings.  In case the writing didn’t really put a picture in your head.  And there he is, in the flesh, Agent Michael Scarn.  Now we know what he looks like.  ",2,7,14
Jim," Do we all have our copy of “Threat Level: Midnight”, by Michael Scott?",2,7,14
Jim," Alright, let’s get this started.  I’m gonna be reading the action descriptions, and Phyllis, I would like you to play Catherine Zeta Jones.",2,7,14
Jim," Why not, Dwight?  This is a movie.  I mean, this is for all of America to enjoy.",2,7,14
Jim, The lead role of Agent Michael Scarn?  ,2,7,14
Jim," [reading the screenplay] Inside the FBI, Agent Michael Scarn sits with his feet up on his desk.  Catherine Zeta Jones enters.",2,7,14
Jim, Michael Scarn takes out a nine-millimeter gun and shoots the-,2,7,14
Jim," A man sitting several seats down, who has a gold face, turns to Michael Scarn. [out of character] Uh… Ooh, Oscar, you wanna play Goldenface?",2,7,14
Jim," Well, some of us wanna keep reading, so-",2,7,14
Jim," That’s actually a good idea.  We’ll all take a brief intermission. [To Pam]  Hey, are you hungry?",2,7,14
Jim," I had plans to meet a friend tonight.  Which I had to cancel.  But this is cool, too. I’m not a complainer.  ",2,7,14
Jim," Nice.  That’s excellent, because bugs love my famous grilled cheese sandwich.",2,7,14
Jim," So, I guess I’ll see you in [looks at watch] ten hours.",2,7,14
Jim, Travel.  I’ve been looking forward to it.  It’s gonna be… really nice.  Gonna find myself.,2,7,14
Jim, Yeah. [Pam puts her hand out for an earbud] Definitely.  ,2,7,14
Jim, Jan didn’t come back for her car last night.,2,7,14
Jim, Could it be that Agent Michael Scarn has finally found his Catherine Zeta?,2,7,14
Jim, Some might even say that we had our first date last night.,2,7,14
Jim," Cause there was dinner, by candlelight.",2,7,14
Jim," Dinner and a show, if you include Michael’s movie. [Pam nods reluctantly]  And there was dancing and fireworks.  Pretty good date.",2,7,14
Jim," You’re right, we didn’t dance.  It was more like, swaying.  But still romantic.",2,7,14
Jim, Least I didn’t leave you at a high school hockey game.,2,7,14
Jim," Ok, we didn’t dance.  I was totally joking anyway.  I mean, it’s not really a date if the girl goes home to her fiance.  Right?		  ",2,7,14
Jim," Ok, you know what, uh, how much is that?",2,8,15
Jim," Wow.  Um, ok. [pops Dwight’s orb with scissors]  				",2,8,15
Jim, We don’t have double-tabbed manila file folders.,2,8,15
Jim," Alright… well, I’m not asking for a raise. I’m gonna actually be asking for a pay decrease.",2,8,15
Jim," Wait, wait; one thing.  Uh, by tomorrow, you mean Saturday, right?",2,8,15
Jim, Today is Thursday.  But Dwight thinks that it’s Friday.  And that’s what I’ll be working on this afternoon.  				,2,8,15
Jim," Eck!… Oh! Also, it is Thursday, but Dwight thinks it’s Friday.  So, keep that goin’.",2,8,15
Jim," [on phone] Hey, Dan, this is Jim, and it is about 11:15, and I wanted to know what you were up to tomorrow, which is the fifteenth, and that is a… ",2,8,15
Jim," [pumps fist] …Saturday, so just let me know what you’re doing tomorrow, Saturday, for lunch. Ok, talk to you soon.  				",2,8,15
Jim," Course, it’s on every Thursday night, so how could I miss it?",2,8,15
Jim," I don’t really wanna picture it.  But thank you, Pam.",2,8,15
Jim," Um, you don’t, I don’t think, come all the way back, you know.  Especially working together.",2,8,15
Jim," It’s true. I’m having a party.  I’ve got three cases of imported beer, a karaoke machine, and I didn’t invite Michael.  So three ingredients for a great party.  And it’s nothing personal, I just think that if he were there, people wouldn’t be able to relax, and you know, have fun, and my roommate wants to meet everybody.  Because I’m pretty sure he thinks that I’m making Dwight up.  [sighs]  He is very real.  				",2,9,16
Jim, Because not everybody knows about the party.,2,9,16
Jim," So, Dwight thinks that tonight is a surprise party for Michael.",2,9,16
Jim," [laughs] Oh man.  Oh, you know what, speaking of which, I was just trying to get a handle on, you know, numbers for food and stuff.  So do you think that Roy’s gonna come, or…",2,9,16
Jim, Because you said “do you wanna hang out”-,2,9,16
Jim," Quick announcement everybody, if I could have everybody’s attention.  We do have wine in the kitchen, and, uh, there is beer available on the porch and despite what you might think, it’s not all for Meredith and Kelly, so please enjoy.",2,9,16
Jim, Great. [to a group of guests]  Just wanna let you guys know that we will be taking the tour like I promised-,2,9,16
Jim, Hey!  Just in time!  You wanna go on the group tour? We were just about to leave.,2,9,16
Jim," Well, the group tour is now leaving, then.  Ladies and gentlemen, just a few things that we are gonna be pointing out to you today, you will be able to see both bedrooms and, uh, if we’re lucky, maybe get a chance to peek into the bathroom, who knows.  I have to remind you that flash photography is prohibited and as much as you can, please refrain from touching things. I know you might want to.",2,9,16
Jim," Uh, actually, I haven’t talked to her in a while.",2,9,16
Jim," See, I knew we lost somebody on the tour.  It’s-",2,9,16
Jim," Yeah, that… Yep, that feels about right.",2,9,16
Jim," You know what?  Let’s just leave that image out of it, because this is a happy place.  Happy thoughts, Pam.  Happy thoughts.",2,9,16
Jim," Yeah, you don’t have to, ummm.  Alright, yes, that’s not gonna be awkward at all.",2,9,16
Jim, Oh by the way how’s your side project going?,2,9,16
Jim," So this year, for the first time ever, I got Pam in Secret Santa. And I got her this teapot, which I know she really wants, so she can make tea at her desk. But I’m also going to stuff it with some inside jokes. Like, this is my high school yearbook photo. She saw it at the party, and it really makes her laugh. Not sure why. What else .. ooh. This is a hot sauce packet. She put this on a hot dog a couple years ago because she thought it was ketchup. And it was really funny, so I kept the other two. [holds up a miniature pencil] This would take a little too long to explain, so I won’t. And this is the card. Because Christmas is the time to tell people how you feel.  				",2,10,17
Jim," Well, I can’t tell you cause it’s a secret. ",2,10,17
Jim," Well, there’s a $20 limit, right? So .. ?",2,10,17
Jim," That’s great. Well don’t tell me who it is, cause I can .. ",2,10,17
Jim," He obviously forgot to get me something, and then he went in his closet and dug out this little number [holds up way-too-short sleeves] and then threw it in a bag.  				",2,10,17
Jim, I thought that was called Nasty Christmas.,2,10,17
Jim," Oh, shouldn’t we … I bought that specifically for Pam.",2,10,17
Jim," Yeah, but, Michael, the point is that we all bought gifts for specific people.",2,10,17
Jim," I bought this teapot for Pam, and I know she really wants it. So, can I trade you for it?",2,10,17
Jim," Come on, it’s a shamrock keychain. Good luck.",2,10,17
Jim," Look, it has sentimental value, Dwight. Can I buy it from you?",2,10,17
Jim," To think that my gift for Pam will be used for that, it’s a little too much to handle.  				",2,10,17
Jim," You know, you don’t have to answer calls during a party. Just thought you should know.",2,10,17
Jim," Well, either way. This is an amazing gift because it comes with bonus gifts. Look inside.",2,10,17
Jim, I didn’t think you were going to get that one. I really didn’t.  				,2,10,17
Jim," Wow, that’s weird. Oh, dollar for a stapler, that’s pretty good.",2,11,18
Jim," Here, you know what? You can have some nickels.",2,11,18
Jim," “It’s time for our first quarter camaraderie event, so pack a swimsuit, a toothbrush, rubber-soled shoes, and a ski mask.”",2,11,18
Jim," So that he can have us rob a bank, and then escape through the sewers.",2,11,18
Jim, I’m not really sure what movie you’re talking about. Are you sure you got the title right?,2,11,18
Jim," Michael stands in the front of the boat and says that he’s king of the world within the first hour, or I give you my next paycheck.  				",2,11,18
Jim, Yeah. [chanting] Darryl! Darryl! Darryl!,2,11,18
Jim," Um… let’s see, uh…  The customer. Because the customer is king.",2,11,18
Jim, You know what? I would save the receptionist. I just wanted to clear that up.  				,2,11,18
Jim," Oh, right, because you announced that his ship was sinking?",2,11,18
Jim," That’s… great. You know, to tell the truth, I used to have a big thing for Pam, so… ",2,11,18
Jim," Yeah. She’s really funny, and she’s warm. And she’s just… well, anyway.",2,11,18
Jim," It’s, okay, it’s Jim.  Just say again, uh, really loudly what happened.",2,12,19
Jim, But you said that you went out with her this weekend.,2,12,19
Jim, [sounds of a car crash] What was that… ,2,12,19
Jim," Oh Dwight, Dwight, [Dwight pukes on his back windshield]  Ohhhhhh!",2,12,19
Jim," He’s still driving… Dwight, you forgot your bumper!",2,12,19
Jim," So, I guess Pam and Dwight are friends now.  				",2,12,19
Jim, Do you think Dwight’s bein’ a little weird today?,2,12,19
Jim," Quick question: uh, why is Tom Hanks on the wall?",2,12,19
Jim, I want to clamp Michael’s face in a George Foreman grill.  				,2,12,19
Jim, You mean today?  He stepped on a George Foremen grill and he burned his foot.,2,12,19
Jim," Uh, ok, I think we need to take him to the hospital because I’m pretty sure he has a concussion.",2,12,19
Jim," Slowly, slowly.  Let’s just get to the elevator.",2,12,19
Jim," [Dwight falls onto the couch] Stop, stop, stop, stop.",2,12,19
Jim, You don’t think you should sit in the back with Dwight?  				,2,12,19
Jim, Give the bottle to Michael [sprays Dwight],2,12,19
Jim," Michael stop. [sprays Michael, then Dwight]",2,12,19
Jim," It’s Kurt.  Wow, I am so sad that I know that.",2,12,19
Jim, Concussion. [Michael scribbles something out] What did you write?,2,12,19
Jim, So you thought they meant your reason for coming to the hospital.,2,12,19
Jim," Uh hmm, he should be fine, but, uh, they brought him in for a CAT scan.",2,12,19
Jim, Michael went in there with him too.  It’s pretty sweet.,2,12,19
Jim," But they shouldn’t be much longer now, so we’ll be back soon.",2,12,19
Jim," Umm, is it me or does it smell like up-dog in here?",2,13,20
Jim, Yeah. On the booze cruise I told Michael about some feelings I used to have for Pam. I had just broken up with Katy and had a couple drinks. And I confided in the world’s worst confidant.  				,2,13,20
Jim, Remember that thing I told you on the booze cruise about Pam? That… was… personal so if we can just keep that between you and me. That would be great.,2,13,20
Jim, Tony the tiger.  You don’t hear that much any more.,2,13,20
Jim," Um, I had asked Michael if I could head up the Oscar investigation and he said that only Dwight was capable of handling such sensitive material.",2,13,20
Jim, I don’t know probably just gonna eat my ham and cheese sandwich in the break room.,2,13,20
Jim," No, that’s alright, thank you though. It’s, I, gotta do some cleaning, should probably stick around here.",2,13,20
Jim," Oh, ah, no but no. You know what let’s go out. That was a good idea.  Let’s go out.",2,13,20
Jim," Can I just have the ham and cheese sandwich, thanks.",2,13,20
Jim," Uh, I really don’t want to talk about it.",2,13,20
Jim," Um, she’s easy to talk to I guess and she’s got a really good sense of humor.",2,13,20
Jim," [Holds up Hooters t-shirt] Just you know politics, literature.",2,13,20
Jim, Well the cats out of the bag. I used to have a crush on Pam and now I [hesitate] don’t. Riveting.  				,2,13,20
Jim," It expired in August, and my cell phone charger from two years ago.",2,13,20
Jim," Hey oh, listen, um, I told Michael on the booze cruise. It’s so stupid. Um, I told Michael that I had had a crush on you when you first started here.",2,13,20
Jim," Well I thought that, I figured you should hear it from me rather than, I mean you know Michael.",2,13,20
Jim," And seriously, it’s totally not a big deal, ok? And when I found out you were engaged, I mean.",2,13,20
Jim, And Pam it was like three years ago so I am totally over it.,2,13,20
Jim," Hey, hey, wow, wow. Listen man it’s, you know what. It’s not a big deal.",2,13,20
Jim," Look its one day, everything’s gonna be alright. No big deal. You good?",2,13,20
Jim," Pam’s on vacation and she gets back tomorrow, so it’ll be nice to see her.  It’ll be nice, and, uh, she set a date for the wedding with Roy.  Uh… June.  Summer.  So, that’ll be nice.  And that’s that.   					",2,14,21
Jim," So, how was the resort?  Did you ski a lot?",2,14,21
Jim, What?  I did not do that.  That sounds disgusting.   					,2,14,21
Jim, That might be a little difficult with the one computer. ,2,14,21
Jim, But there’s definitely a desk open in the back. ,2,14,21
Jim," No, no, no, seriously, I’ll be in the back.   					",2,14,21
Jim," Um, just for the day while Michael’s at my desk. ",2,14,21
Jim, Nothing much.  Let me ask you something.  It’s actually little awkward.,2,14,21
Jim," [on phone] Hey, Brenda.  This is, uh, Jim Halpert from the boat.  And I got your number from the corporate directory and, well, I was assuming that you probably gave it to them because you wanted me to ask you out, right?  Um, so gimme a call back.  You can get my number from said directory, um, or just check your e-mail ’cause I just sent you one.  Yikes.  Uh… give me a call back, I hope.  I’ll talk to you later. Bye.",2,14,21
Jim," It’s a complete… well, actually it’s exactly what you’d expect, so… How are the girls?",2,15,22
Jim, I think you should do it. That’s great!,2,15,22
Jim," You got to take a chance on something sometime, Pam. I mean, do you want to be a receptionist here, always?",2,15,22
Jim," So I broke up with Katy and haven’t been dating anybody else, so this year I don’t have to worry about Valentine’s Day. It’s gonna be good. I invited a couple of friends over. We’re gonna play some cards and I’ll end up winning a lotta money. Because, they’re idiots. It’s gonna be great.   				",2,16,23
Jim," OH, that’s great. I’m really happy for [starts to walk away]",2,16,23
Jim," [on phone] Nah that’s alright. Spend money on her, instead of giving it to us. That’s fine. No, I didn’t even have a seat for you anyway. Yeah, hahaha, alright man, have a good night. Bye.   				",2,16,23
Jim, Take it slow. ‘Cause it seems like a lot of the time things like that need… [Ryan walks in],2,16,23
Jim," [under breath] Oh, no, not while I’m here.",2,16,23
Jim," You know what? Here’s the deal, Kelly. It would be really nice if he was in to you, right? It’d be great, but he isn’t. ",2,16,23
Jim," Well, he’s not, though. So you just gotta suck it up. You just gotta move on. Try to have some fun. Come to my poker game tonight.",2,16,23
Jim," Yeah. Alright, Beesly, Hey, Happy Valentine’s Day. ",2,16,23
Jim," Dwight was the top salesman of the year at our company. He wins a little prize money and gets honored at some convention. It is literally the highest possible honor that a Northeastern Pennsylvania-Based Mid-size Paper Company Regional Salesman can attain, so…   					",2,17,24
Jim," Oh, I should get back. Talk to you guys later.",2,17,24
Jim," Hi, yeah, can I talk to one of your travel agents?  					",2,17,24
Jim, I’m going to take a trip. I’m going to get out of town for a while… and go someplace… not here.  					,2,17,24
Jim, Where do I want to go? Um… that is an excellent question. And one I should have probably thought about before I called you. Um…   					,2,17,24
Jim, So. Uh… I am going on a trip. But not really sure where I’m going yet. It’s kind of open-ended. So I was hoping maybe you guys would have some suggestions?,2,17,24
Jim," I was thinking more like Europe. Or something like that. But, good second choice.",2,17,24
Jim, Dwight. If you could travel anywhere in the world where would you go? ,2,17,24
Jim, Okay. Just trying to get some advice on my trip.,2,17,24
Jim, You know I majored in Public Speaking in College.,2,17,24
Jim, Mmmhmm. And the first thing they teach you is that you’ve got to be true to your self. And you are all about authority.,2,17,24
Jim," The great speakers throughout history were not joke tellers. They were people of passion. So if you want to do well today, you got to do what they did.",2,17,24
Jim, You’ve got to wave your arms and you’ve got to pound your fists. Many times. It’s supposed to emphasize your point.  					,2,17,24
Jim," Ok, I didn’t actually major in Public Speaking. But, I did download speeches from some of history’s famous dictators. Like this one [holds up paper]. Originally given by Benito Mussolini.   					",2,17,24
Jim," Ok, look. I know you are giving this speech on your own ",2,17,24
Jim," I’m going. I’m a little nervous to run into Dwight on his connecting flight to Mordor. But, other than that… um, yeah, I bought the ticket, non-refundable.",2,17,24
Jim, I don’t know. I feel like I have plenty of time to figure out the details but… ,2,17,24
Jim," Yeah. And I’m really sorry about that, I just… ",2,17,24
Jim, Yeah. Do you want me to take these on my way out?,2,17,24
Jim," Pfft. So have I. Hey, question. If you had to spend a night in the Met or the Aquarium, which would it be?",2,18,25
Jim," Definitely. Yes. Glad you said that. …You don’t want to help me with some of my sales, do you? ‘Cause, I’m kind of swamped.",2,18,25
Jim, I’m Jim. [Jim hi-fives Abby] Annnnd… let’s sell some paper.,2,18,25
Jim," [shaking hands with Abby] Ow, ow, ow, ow, you broke my hand. ",2,18,25
Jim," Really? ‘Cause she’s pretty strong, Dwight.",2,18,25
Jim," Can’t believe his mom dressed him like that, that’s the real tragedy.",2,18,25
Jim," Ohh, man, I would love to! I can’t tonight, but can I come over some other time? [Abby nods]",2,18,25
Jim," Thanks, Kev. Uhm… I’m actually going on a date.",2,18,25
Jim, Why does he own a guitar if he doesn’t know how to play?,2,18,25
Jim," No, um. How is this not a pyramid scheme? ",2,19,26
Jim," Man, I’m so sorry. When do you find out?",2,19,26
Jim," Maybe, but… we’re gonna need somebody to create a diversion, and…",2,19,26
Jim," So. We got Kev some stuff. Um… a party pack of M&M’s, his favorite candy. A DVD of American Pie 2, which is his favorite movie, and, he lent it to Creed, so, I can guarantee you he won’t get that back. ",2,19,26
Jim," Which we realize sounds crass, but, it… is his favorite number.",2,19,26
Jim, [puts fabric softener into cart] …What?,2,19,26
Jim, Yeah. Okay. Oh. I dare you to make an announcement.,2,19,26
Jim," Well that’s an invasion of privacy, so, I’m going to tell Michael.",2,19,26
Jim, Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa. [Michael skates by],2,19,26
Jim," So, yesterday Dwight found half a joint in the parking lot. Which is unfortunate because as it turns out, Dwight ",2,20,27
Jim, [mimicking Stanley] I enjoy the tangy zip of Miracle Whip. ,2,20,27
Jim, I’m just saying that you can’t be sure that is wasn’t you. ,2,20,27
Jim," Marijuana is a memory loss drug, so maybe you just don’t remember. ",2,20,27
Jim," Well, how could you, if it just erased your memory? ",2,20,27
Jim, No! You said that I’d be conducting the interview when I walked in here. Now exactly how much pot did you smoke? ,2,20,27
Jim," Oh, um…[mimicking Stanley] Why do you keep CC’ing me on things that have nothing to do with me?  [Pam and Oscar laugh, Stanley walks in, and Oscar leaves quickly] ",2,20,27
Jim," Oh, hey Stanley. Uh, I was just doing an impression. ",2,20,27
Jim," [presses drink button, looks at camera, makes Jim-face]  				",2,20,27
Jim, How much time do you have left on your break? ,2,20,27
Jim, Wow. What a terrible day to not be able to talk.  Dwight was literally carrying around his own urine and dressed like one of the Village People. Why does he do the things that he does for Michael?  I just don’t get it. What is he getting out of that relationship?   				,2,20,27
Jim," Yeah, I mean it’s inevitable. I definitely overhear some wedding preparation, but I’m fine with it. She hears me arranging my social life. And we both have to hear Dwight order deer urine over the Internet, so it evens out.  					",2,21,28
Jim, And I didn’t tell anyone because I’m not really sure how I feel about it.,2,21,28
Jim," Well, I’m not actually making a formal complaint. I just really think we should talk about it.",2,21,28
Jim," Well, it was redacted. Look, if she wants an invite, maybe she’s just trying to be friends.",2,21,28
Jim," [sighs] Well, what does Roy think about everything?",2,21,28
Jim," Hey… you know what, Dwight? Maybe we should get our photo I.D. taken together.",2,21,28
Jim," Well, it saves time, you know. ‘Cause we could just meet in the parking lot every morning. Walk in together. Perfect.",2,21,28
Jim, This came out really well. [picks up Dwight’s I.D. from the laminating machine and hands it to Dwight] There you go.,2,21,28
Jim, [laughs] Yes! Five bucks each. And it was totally worth it.  					,2,21,28
Jim," That actually took a while. I had to put, uh, more and more nickels into his handset, till he got used to the weight, and then I just… took ’em all out.  					",2,21,28
Jim," Just a simple macro. You know, these actually don’t sound that funny one after another. But he does deserve it, though.  					",2,21,28
Jim," Yeah, I just moved it an inch every time he went to the bathroom. And that’s how I spent my entire day that day.  					",2,21,28
Jim, I… I didn’t know that Toby was gonna write it down. [the camera flashes] I was just venting.,2,21,28
Jim, And I took it right back. It was like… ,2,21,28
Jim," [on Pam’s answering machine] Hey, Pam… it’s Jim. Um, I have a doctor’s appointment in the city. So I probably won’t be in till the late afternoon. Just thought I’d let you know. Okay, bye. [camera shows Jim sitting on a waiting coach in another Dunder Mifflin office]",2,21,28
Jim," Ever since I was a little kid, like, eight or nine, I could sort of control things with my mind.",2,22,29
Jim," It was just little thing, you know, like I could make something shake or I could make a marble fall off the counter. You know, just little things.",2,22,29
Jim," Okay, I’ll try. [The coat rack wobbles] [Pam holds up an umbrella handle to the camera in another scene]",2,22,29
Jim, I think you mean the aid to Afghanistan. ,2,22,29
Jim," Wait, wait, where you going? I mean, even if you don’t hire a band, you still have to watch the bands. Pam, these are people who have never given up on their dreams. I have great respect for that. And, yes, they’re all probably very bad and that will make me feel better about not having dreams. ",2,22,29
Jim," Why did I talk to Jan about transferring? Well, you know… I have no future here.   				",2,22,29
Jim, [Jim ejects a videotape from the VCR and puts in a new one] Wow. I don’t know how you’re gonna decide. They are all extremely good.,2,22,29
Jim," Your mom would love that. She would. Oh, this band is called Scrantonicity.",2,22,29
Jim," Oh, my God, that’s Kevin! Great song, Kev. Oh,  my God, he’s the drummer and the singer.  				",2,22,29
Jim," Yeah, you haven’t seen that since 1983. That is amazing. Okay, we have to sign him. I’m gonna call the label, we’re gonna…",2,22,29
Jim," No, Pam, you’re gonna lose him to another wedding.",2,22,29
Jim, [coughs] I will raise. [Dwight sighs and folds his cards] Thanks.  				,2,22,29
Jim," It’s the weirdest thing. Every time I cough, he folds.  				",2,22,29
Jim," So, that’s still going on, huh? You and Kelly?  				",2,22,29
Jim," Yeah. Hey, can I talk to you about something?",2,22,29
Jim," I’m really sorry if that’s weird for you to hear, but I needed you to hear it. Probably not good timing, I know that. I just…",2,22,29
Jim, Come on. I don’t wanna do that. I wanna be ,2,22,29
Jim, Not your fault. I’m sorry I misinterpreted our friendship.  				,2,22,29
Jim, [after “the kiss”] You have no idea how long I’ve wanted to do that.,3,1,31
Jim, Are you really gonna marry him?  [Pam nods] …Ok.  					,3,1,31
Jim,"  I can’t say whether Dunder Mifflin paper is less flammable, sir, but I can assure that it is certainly not more flammable.  					",3,1,31
Jim,  Why did I transfer to Stamford?  I think that’s pretty obvious.  I got promoted!  And you can’t beat that view… right?  					,3,1,31
Jim," I ate a tuna sandwich, on my first day.  So, Andy started calling me Big Tuna.  …I don’t think any of them actually know my real name.  					",3,1,31
Jim," You know, when I saw Dwight, I realized how stupid and petty all those pranks I pulled on him were. And then he spoke. I wonder how hard it would be to get a copy of his room key.  ",3,2,32
Jim," Oh, no, sorry, it’s an inside joke. There’s this bartender at Stamford who, uh… you know what? You’d just have to be there.",3,2,32
Jim," All right, nice meeting you, Ted. Take care.",3,2,32
Jim," Oh, no, it was… you know, a good opportunity for me, a promotion. I got a chance to… ",3,2,32
Jim," Michael, it’s really not a competition.  ",3,2,32
Jim, Dwight’s room key. And… Dwight’s room. What can I say? Old habits die hard.,3,2,32
Jim," Oh my God. Dwight got a hooker! Oh my God, I gotta call… well, I gotta call somebody, I don’t even know who to call. Dwight got a hooker!  ",3,2,32
Jim," Wait, wait. I didn’t transfer because of you. You’re a good boss. You’re a great boss.",3,2,32
Jim," Michael, it’s not about… I transferred because of Pam.",3,2,32
Jim," No, I just… I heard something about that. It’s just, I kind of put it all on the line. Twice, actually. And she said no. Twice.",3,2,32
Jim," At the Stamford branch, they all play this World War II video game called Call of Duty, and they’re all really into it.  I’m told it started as a team building exercise.  Unfortunately I really suck at it.  We didn’t play many video games in Scranton.  Instead we’d do stuff like, uh, Pam and I would sometimes hum the same high pitched note, and try to get Dwight to make an appointment with an ear doctor.  And uh, Pam called it… Pretendenitus.    ",3,3,33
Jim," I’m just killing Germans, any way I can.",3,3,33
Jim," [turning around to Karen] Wait, are we playing teams?",3,3,33
Jim," Yeah I think we can be a big help to your company.  [someone dims the lights, signifying that it’s game time]  Ok, see you next week.  Bye.  [to Karen] Again?",3,3,33
Jim," Oh, I’m sorry I don’t know… what we’re talking about…",3,3,33
Jim, I’m sorry what are you whispering about?,3,3,33
Jim," What? [Karen’s player shoots Jim’s player, “You killed Jim Halpert” appears on the screen, Karen giggles]",3,3,33
Jim, Wow. Psychopath.  [Karen grins widely at Jim]  ,3,3,33
Jim," [leaving his desk for the day, pretends pull the pen out of a pretend grenade, and tosses it to Karen]",3,3,33
Jim," [playing Call of Duty] Oh? Someone’s left out in the open, taking a little siesta. Not smart. [shoots] Yes! Finally killed you… [Karen’s desk is empty]",3,3,33
Jim, Things are a little bit… different here in Stamford. [shrug] It’s not bad.  ,3,3,33
Jim," Mmm, that’s where you’re wrong.  I’m your project supervisor today, and I have just decided that we’re not doing anything until you get the chips that you require.  So, I think we should go get some.  Now, please.    				",3,4,34
Jim," Okay, that is a “no” on the on the West Side Market.",3,4,34
Jim," Oh, there’s no game.  We’re just trying to get these chips for Karen.",3,4,34
Jim, I have no idea.  We went right for the copier.,3,4,34
Jim," [on phone]  Hi, yeah.  This is Mike from the West Side Market.  Well, we get a shipment of Herr’s salt and vinegar chips, and we ordered that about three weeks ago and haven’t … . yeah.  You have ’em in the warehouse.  Great.  What is my store number… six.  Wait, no.  I’ll call you back. [quickly hangs up] Shut up [to Karen]. ",3,4,34
Jim," I called the manufacturer, who referred me to distributor, who referred me to the vending machine company, who told me that they sell them in the machines in the building next door.   				",3,4,34
Jim," No, I didn’t. I took back my chair that you took from me, but I didn’t take your chair. ",3,5,35
Jim," [sings] Love me, love me, say that you love me, fool me, fool me,",3,5,35
Jim," Go on and fool me. Love me, love me, say that you love me",3,5,35
Jim," fool me, fool me, go on and fool me. Love me,",3,5,35
Jim," Love me, say that you love me. Fool me, fool me, go on and fool me.  ",3,5,35
Jim," Sorry, I forgot Kevin’s extension. It’s a fantasy football thing. ",3,5,35
Jim," And I was just going to go through the system cause I didn’t think you’d be there. Why, why are you still there?",3,5,35
Jim, Wow. Do you think you could send me a copy of that?,3,5,35
Jim," What time is it here? Um, we’re in the same time zone. ",3,5,35
Jim, How many words per minute does the average person type?,3,5,35
Jim, Shut up. Mavis Beacon doesn’t even type 90. ,3,5,35
Jim, Forget it. I was just about to brag but forget it.,3,5,35
Jim, No way. How do you confuse 28 Days with 28 Days Later?,3,5,35
Jim," Yes. Fancy New Beesley would make that up. New apartment, new stories.",3,5,35
Jim," Wow, you got totally taken for a ride Beesley.",3,5,35
Jim, Most apartments these days have like three.,3,5,35
Jim, Yes!  How are you going to cook every meal of the day in one kitchen? ,3,5,35
Jim," Oh, yeah, I should, I should, I should probably go too. ",3,5,35
Jim," I started biking into work. Josh does it and he lives a lot farther away than I do. And also it saves gas money, keeps me in shape… helps the environment. And now I know it makes me really sweaty for work.   					",3,6,36
Jim," Once a quarter, the sales staff at this branch has to stay late to do order form consolidation… which, amazingly, is even less interesting than it sounds.  					",3,6,36
Jim," Can I have a ride, man? I… uh… I have my bike.",3,6,36
Jim," Man, you can really hold your liquor, Billabelli.",3,6,36
Jim," No kidding. And I am just going to lie down in the back, if that’s all right.",3,6,36
Jim,"  I don’t have a ton of contact with the Scranton branch, but, before I left, I took a box of Dwight’s stationery, so, from time to time, I send Dwight faxes. From himself. From the future. [reading fax] “Dwight, at 8 A.M. today, someone poisons the coffee. Do not drink the coffee. More instructions will follow. Cordially, Future Dwight.”  				",3,7,37
Jim," I worked in Scranton for a really long time. And uh, it’s going to be weird that it’s all disappearing. I mean, I always knew that the branch would shut down someday. I just figured it would be because Michael sold the building for some magic beans.  				",3,7,37
Jim," I know it’s not definite or whatever, but uh, do you know who’s coming over here from Scranton?",3,7,37
Jim," Okay, so is it like sales or… accountants?",3,7,37
Jim," Say what you will about Michael Scott, but he would never do that.  				",3,7,37
Jim," No, it’s just I’m not sure if I um… well to be quite honest with you, Jan, I have a few unpleasant memories of Scranton. And um…",3,7,37
Jim," No. No, no. Just um… some personal stuff. And I’m not really ready to revist that, I don’t think.",3,7,37
Jim, I really don’t know.  How you doing with all this?,3,7,37
Jim, New York City is 45 minutes down the road from here. And you wanna  move to Scranton? I dunno. If I were you I’d move to New York?,3,7,37
Jim," Hey, um, I think I am gonna take that job. And Scranton… it’s not that bad. So, if they offer you a job there, I think you should take it.",3,7,37
Jim, You know what? I think you just need to meet him.,3,8,38
Jim," Yes. This is going to be very interesting. All right, I’m out of here. See you later? ",3,8,38
Jim," Yeah, I was just doing a little joke there about how we’d never met… ",3,8,38
Jim, Awesome! Good to be back. The place looks really good.,3,8,38
Jim," Where do I stand with Pam? Um… no idea. I mean, we’re friends. Always have been friends. Um… .that is where we stand.  ",3,8,38
Jim, I don’t know what you’re talking about.,3,8,38
Jim, Hey! How are you man? Good to see… you.,3,8,38
Jim," Oh, I’m sorry. Are you sitting here now? ",3,8,38
Jim," You know, man, it’s really you’re call.",3,8,38
Jim, It reminds me of the orientation video showed on my first day. ‘The Scranton Witch Project’.  ,3,8,38
Jim," Not bad, but you are Italian so… try it more Italian.",3,8,38
Jim, Oh yeah. I’m trying to move away from that. Getting into more of a bottled water phase.,3,8,38
Jim," Oh! Um… tonight, actually? No. I’m uh just still getting settled.",3,8,38
Jim, Nope. You’re not interrupting anything. Nope. I’m… ,3,8,38
Jim, All right. [to Pam] I should probably get back to work. Get back to work.,3,8,38
Jim," [talking on cellphone] Hey! Where you at, Filippelli? ",3,8,38
Jim, [laughs] What’s wrong? You didn’t have a good first day? ,3,8,38
Jim, Yeah. Sure. Sounds good. I… . [sees Pam in rearview mirror] Hey! You know what? Can I give you a call right back?,3,8,38
Jim," Oh, nothing. I just feel bad. I feel like things were a little weird today… or something. ",3,8,38
Jim, I just think I should tell you that… I’ve sort of started seeing someone. And uh… ,3,8,38
Jim," Yes. I have started to see Karen. It’s very new, and… not really ready to talk about it openly yet, just because, I think, once the word gets out there, it might affect the way people behave around us or… I dunno. Just, not yet.  				",3,9,39
Jim," Yeah, trust me, that would be fun for no one.",3,9,39
Jim," I know Pam pretty well. I know the things that she likes, and, just as important, I know the things that she hates. So, one of the things that she likes is pranks. And, the things that she hates…   				",3,9,39
Jim," Lead off with that. She loves hunting. She also loves those ads for Six Flags, with the old guy. [Andy hums Six Flag ad] Got it. Also… do you speak pig latin?  				",3,9,39
Jim, Oh. Andy. I thought of one last tact you can take with Pam. ,3,9,39
Jim, Quick question – do you play the guitar?,3,9,39
Jim," Hold on, let me think about that, yes, that’ll work. But can you sing in a sexy high falsetto voice?",3,9,39
Jim, …I’m messing with Andy. I’m sending him to all the women in the office with… just… terrible information on how to get them to go out with him.,3,9,39
Jim," …Oh, you know what? … It was… gonna be Pam, but… ",3,9,39
Jim," Uh, you know what though? I feel like I already sicked him on Pam… we’ll give her a break. Let’s think of someone else.  				",3,9,39
Jim," That is… quite the rap sheet, Prison Mike.",3,9,39
Jim," But the paint’s chipping. Is that your old bike, Michael?",3,10,40
Jim," [Creed takes toy from toy drive box.] Oh, I think you’re supposed to put a toy ",3,10,40
Jim, [Carol walks through door looking upset] [waves] Carol. ,3,10,40
Jim," It’s a bold move, to Photoshop yourself into a picture with your girlfriend and her kids on a ski trip with their real father. But then again, Michael’s a bold guy. [Towards unseen cameraman] Is bold the right word?   					",3,10,40
Jim," [Opens folder and reads from Dwight’s file] Last year, my boss, Michael Scott, took a day off because he said he had pneumonia, but really, he was leaving early to go to magic camp. Wow.",3,10,40
Jim," [closes folder] You know what? Uh, I really don’t think I should be doing this stuff anymore, you know? ",3,10,40
Jim," I feel like there’s a chance for me to start over. And if I fall back into the same kind of things I used to do., then … what am I doing?  					",3,10,40
Jim," Yup, looks like the Scranton people and the Stamford people are finally coming together. And that’s what you want, right?  					",3,10,40
Jim," As ranking number two, I am starting a committee to determine the validity of the two committees and I am the sole member. The committee will act on this now. ",3,10,40
Jim, Could you please keep it down? [interrupted Dwight] I’m in session. I’ve determined that this committee is valid. [Pam and Karen cheer.],3,10,40
Jim," OK. [to Ryan] Wow, thanks for taking all the excuses, dude.",3,10,40
Jim," And she’s trying to correctly butcher a goose, but she’s having trouble coming up with it.",3,10,40
Jim," Oh no, this is different. The CIA thing, that was a prank on Dwight. This is more like a umm… OK, it’s pretty much the same thing.  					",3,10,40
Jim," I’m sure they’ll want to meet her, too.   					",3,10,40
Jim," What a horrible, horrible movie that was. ",3,10,40
Jim," Well, for starters, I’ve known you as a couple since the beginning of the relationship, which was approximately [looks a watch] three hours ago. ",3,10,40
Jim," Yeah. Which, don’t get me wrong, can be a really fun distraction, but, when it’s over, you’re left thinking about the girl you really like, the one that broke your heart.  					",3,10,40
Jim," [to Pam] Oh, you know what? Sorry, forgot to tell you. I intercepted a transmission earlier and it seems that the CIA is gonna need Dwight down at their headquarters in Langley for training and an ice cream social with the other agents. ",3,10,40
Jim," Hmm… Well, maybe the CIA can send a helicopter? ",3,10,40
Jim," OK. Uh, Karen, any news from that law firm? ",3,11,41
Jim, You’re not allowed to take off your pants in the middle of the office. ,3,11,41
Jim," Dwight, you know what, just back up, okay, that’s making me uncomfortable. This is sexual harassment, by the way. Oh my God! He’s got a knife!",3,11,41
Jim," No, let the record show that Dwight K. Schrute is now completely nude and is holding a plastic knife to Stanley’s neck?!",3,11,41
Jim, [picks up tape recorder and speaks into it] Dwight Schrute is now wearing a baby’s bonnet.,3,11,41
Jim," Oh my God, Karen, you’re right, that is Animal from the Muppet Babies.",3,11,41
Jim," Yeah. Yes. Um, I’m just in this, like, stupid fight with Karen. ",3,11,41
Jim," So, I dunno, I just feel likes we’ve been dating a month, right? Same street. I think that might be a little close. A little much. ",3,11,41
Jim," Oh, yeah, How have we not talked about this already? I mean what happened there? Kidnapping? [both start laughing]  ",3,11,41
Jim," Uh, I think you dropped this [hands over piece of paper]",3,11,41
Jim," Pam, meet Harvey. This is Michael’s new friend.",3,12,42
Jim," Oh well, ‘Yoy’ should bring in ‘Long Tim’ in one day. Shouldn’t he?",3,12,42
Jim," Dwight and I used to go on sales calls all the time. In fact, I have a picture to remember that time. Oh young Jim. There is just so much I need to warn you about. And yet, tragically, I cannot.   				",3,12,42
Jim, Seriously? You’re going to sit in the back?,3,12,42
Jim," Ok, well, that still leaves a 30% chance that I will attack you from the front. ",3,12,42
Jim, We can offer our biggest discounts on 30% recycled and ultra-premium laser. ,3,12,42
Jim," Let me talk to you about a few of the other things we can offer. Namely, we know the tax season is coming up, so by April 1st we can have you fully stocked.  ",3,12,42
Jim, We have discount prices on ink cartridges… ,3,12,42
Jim," And, also, any forms that you are going to need… ",3,12,42
Jim," Sure, that’s true we can’t compete with their prices. But let me ask you something. How important to you is customer service?",3,12,42
Jim, [Dials cell Phone] And this is Dunder-Mifflin. ,3,12,42
Jim," Well, I like pretty women who have the appearance of intelligence. ",3,12,42
Jim, No way! All right Pam. Congratulations. [high five],3,12,42
Jim," Pam? Did I ever have a ‘thing’ for her? No, why? Did she say something? ",3,12,42
Jim," Yeah. Ok, here’s the … I had a crush on her before I left. And I told her about it and she didn’t feel the same way. So, it didn’t amount to anything, and I left. I’m really glad you’re here. ‘Kay?",3,12,42
Jim," I miss Dwight. Congratulations, universe. You win.  ",3,13,43
Jim," Encourage him? I’m the victim, okay? He’s fishing for me. We’ve got to do something.",3,13,43
Jim, I liked you better when you were the temp.,3,13,43
Jim, Would you like to pull a prank on Andy?,3,13,43
Jim, [hands Pam Andy’s phone] Are there any messages?,3,13,43
Jim, You know what?  Maybe it’s in the ceiling.,3,13,43
Jim," [inspecting the hole in the wall] Oh my God, that’s half-inch drywall.",3,13,43
Jim, [imitating Andy] “It’s not freakin’ funny!”  ,3,13,43
Jim, [long pause and then he sighs and nods] Yes.  ,3,13,43
Jim," Prima nocta, I believe from the movie Braveheart, and confirmed on wikipedia, is when the king got to deflower every new bride on her wedding night.  So…  ",3,14,44
Jim," Karen and I had a long talk last night and the night before that and uh, every night, for the last five nights.    ",3,14,44
Jim," Oh.  Yeah well, I guess there’s been a couple late nights. Karen and I have been up talking.",3,14,44
Jim, Good advice Beesley.  Thanks.  See you out there.,3,14,44
Jim," Ah, gotcha.  Okay, so they have Albert Einstein, Ben Franklin, or Sponge Bob Squarepants.",3,14,44
Jim," Michael referred me to a male strip club called Banana Slings.  Instead, I called the Scholastic Speakers of Pennsylvania.  ",3,14,44
Jim," Michael, Dwight would like your man meat.",3,14,44
Jim, Really?  Looks like I hired the right guy.  I’m glad.  Any real potential there Beesley?,3,14,44
Jim," In school, we learned about this scientist who trained dogs to salivate at the sound of a bell by feeding them whenever a bell rang. For the last couple of weeks I’ve been conducting a similar experiment.  					",3,15,45
Jim," [Windows reboot sound] Dwight, want an Altoid?",3,15,45
Jim, You know what? I bet a lot of them are wedding crashers.,3,15,45
Jim," You know I just wish, I wish, I had the investigative powers to smoke some of these guys out.",3,15,45
Jim, When are we going to get to see some of those famous Beesly dance moves?,3,15,45
Jim, Come on. Get out there. Give the people what they want.,3,15,45
Jim," Hypothetically, if I thought Pam was interested, then… No, it’s totally hypothetical.  					",3,15,45
Jim, Here’s a ‘not hypothetical’. I’m really happy I’m with Karen.  					,3,15,45
Jim," Pam’s with Roy. I’m with Karen. And, uh, Brangelina is with Frangelina. Movin’ on.  				",3,16,46
Jim, Okay. Thanks. [hangs up phone] Animal control will be here at six. ,3,16,46
Jim," The bat, I mean, I know I felt it bite me, but look. There’s no mark. I feel so… tingly… so strangely powerful… [shrugs] Oh well.  				",3,16,46
Jim, That bread on your desk? I just picked it up. It’s white hot. ,3,16,46
Jim," Oh, thank God. I have such a headache from that glare.",3,16,46
Jim, The glare off Angela’s crucifix? It’s blinding.   				,3,16,46
Jim, So… you’re cool to just wait here for animal control?,3,16,46
Jim," Cool. Okay. I’m gonna go home and lie down, draw the shades… there’s just so much sun in here… bye Dwight. ",3,16,46
Jim," Sorry, quick thing. Is it true that if you can’t get out, you don’t want anyone to help you? ",3,17,47
Jim," Oh no thanks, I think Karen and I will take my car.",3,17,47
Jim," Why don’t I wanna go? Didn’t expect to need a reason, so let me think here. Um. I don’t know any of these people. It’s an obligation. I don’t like talking paper in my free time, or in my work time. And, did I use the word pointless?  ",3,17,47
Jim," Well, it was nice meeting you guys. Take care.",3,17,47
Jim," No, it was before I knew you so, its fine.  ",3,17,47
Jim," You stay here and have fun, because I’m going to go out back and shoot hoops with David Wallace.",3,17,47
Jim," Wallace? What the hell, have you dated like every guy here? [Karen smiles and gives herself away] Wow. Ok. You got me. ",3,17,47
Jim, I don’t know. Where to begin? My ball.  ,3,17,47
Jim," I guess… all things considered, I was lucky Dwight was there.  And Roy was lucky that Dwight only used pepper spray.  And not the nunchucks or the throwing stars.    				",3,18,48
Jim," Hey man, I never got a chance to thank you… for stopping Roy.  Thank you.",3,18,48
Jim," It was a little glass display case for his for his bobblehead.  That would have made us even, I think.  He saves my life, I get him a box for his desk toy.  Even Steven.  				",3,18,48
Jim," Hey, Mike.  Since Roy left I’ve been doing a lot more work, and I need a raise.",3,18,48
Jim," [softly] Sex, Steve Martin, Terri Hatcher.",3,18,48
Jim, I didn’t say anything.  I was waiting to see what happened.,3,18,48
Jim," No, I mean, you guys really seem to have a strong connection.",3,18,48
Jim, We’ll see.  I’m sure you guys will… find you way back to one another someday.,3,18,48
Jim," Ok, if you don’t want a gift, at least let me buy you a beer, or lunch or something.",3,18,48
Jim," It’s like when he annoys me and I want to screw with him to get him back, he never sees it coming.  But now, I want to be nice to him, and actually give him something, and he’s like an eel.  I just can’t grab onto him.  It’s infuriating.  ",3,18,48
Jim," Well… yes, that’s probably what it is.  So what do I do?",3,18,48
Jim, Wow.  I guess word got around.  That’s a nice… honor.,3,18,48
Jim, [under his breath] Didn’t think you’d notice…  				,3,18,48
Jim," [scoffs] I… will never say a word.  And now, we are even.  				",3,18,48
Jim," Andy, Dwight says welcome back, and he could use a hug.",3,19,49
Jim, Dwight says that he actually doesn’t know one single fact about bear attacks.,3,19,49
Jim," [half-heartedly] Andy!  Nah, that’s too far.",3,19,49
Jim," No, don’t worry about it.  We’ll just got double or nothin’.",3,19,49
Jim," I don’t know, we’ll figure somethin’ out.",3,19,49
Jim," Well, you know, the first performance was a little off.  But I really think they hit their stride, in the second show.  Um, might even bring my parents tomorrow, to the matinee.",3,19,49
Jim," Oh, excuse me.  It’s my… favorite part.  					",3,19,49
Jim," Oh.  He’s going to kill himself, pretending to kill himself.",3,19,49
Jim," Hey uh, Michael.  Don’t jump on the bouncy castle.  You can’t do that, because you’re going to get horribly, horribly injured.",3,19,49
Jim, Fact.  Bears eat beets.  Bears.  Beets.  Battlestar Galactica.,3,20,50
Jim," Last week, I was in a drug store and I saw these glasses.  Uh, four dollars.  And it only cost me seven dollars to recreate the rest of the ensemble.  And that’s a grand total of… [Jim calculates the total on his calculator-watch] eleven dollars.  				",3,20,50
Jim, [on phone] Absolutely.  I couldn’t be more sorry about this.,3,20,50
Jim, One more.  Why are you talking like that?,3,20,50
Jim, What about music?  Do you have any music?,3,20,50
Jim," I was thinkin’ about more like a CD, or… a CD.",3,20,50
Jim," Oh, Andy.  You know what?  We don’t have a ",3,20,50
Jim, Well… that’s not gonna hold up in court.,3,20,50
Jim, Not important.  Because you’re not dating her.  Because it’s a felony.,3,20,50
Jim," Come on man, just give it a couple days.  I think you’ll be all right.",3,20,50
Jim," [singing the intro to The Lion King’s “The Lion Sleeps Tonight”] A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh…",3,20,50
Jim," A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh…",3,20,50

Jim," A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh…",3,20,50
Jim, [Dwight imitates the “Jim face”] Look at that.,3,20,50
Jim," [reads demerit] “Jim Halpert, tardiness.” Ugh. I love it already.",3,21,51
Jim," Oh, I understand. And I also have lots of questions, like, what does a demerit mean?",3,21,51
Jim," OK, I want a copy on my desk by the end of the day or you will receive a full disadulation.",3,21,51
Jim, [on the phone] Thank you. [hangs up the phone] The police are on it. They say they’ve already had three calls.,3,21,51
Jim, [raises hand] Question. Won’t that interfere with your other task forces?,3,21,51
Jim," Wait a second, how are you qualified for that?",3,21,51
Jim, Why don’t you run the meeting? You play with dolls.,3,21,51
Jim, Not really. I’ve seen a bathroom before.,3,21,51
Jim," [in women’s bathroom] Well, I stand corrected. This is pretty cool.",3,21,51
Jim," Oh, right. I remember that one. She read it to me. She said she’s not really ready to date somebody in the office, but she really likes you as a friend.",3,21,51
Jim, [snickers at Pam’s sketch] That is pretty cool.  				,3,21,51
Jim," No, you’re not. I’m looking right at you.",3,21,51
Jim, Don’t. [quietly] I have information about the sex predator.,3,21,51
Jim," In the women’s bathroom, above the sink.",3,21,51
Jim," [starts chanting] Vol-de-mort, Vol-de-mort …[Kevin and Karen follow] Vol-de-mort! Vol-de-mort! Vol-de-mort!",3,22,52
Jim," [to Karen] Woah, stop, stop, stop. There’s a hole. Step over the hole. ",3,22,52
Jim," Yup. [Karen takes a big step] Perfect, oooh, just made it. OK, turn left.  				",3,22,52
Jim," [to Karen] Woah, stop, another hole. Take a big step. [Karen steps into lake] Yes!",3,22,52
Jim," You can’t say, or you can’t pronounce it?",3,22,52
Jim," Oh, my God. I have never seen that look in a man’s eyes… ever. I thought that I might die. On beach day.   				",3,22,52
Jim," [on cell phone] Great. Yeah, I’ll see you next week. Thank you, and here is Karen Filipelli. Bye. ",3,22,52
Jim, How would that work in well?  I just want to know. ,3,22,52
Jim," If this job is in a well, I don’t want it.",3,22,52
Jim," Oh, ’cause I don’t want my feet to get burned. ",3,22,52
Jim," And that is not the same at all. If you’re going to ask other people to do it, you should do it yourself.",3,22,52
Jim," Hey, I know what you’re looking for, but um, I got to be honest, I really don’t think I should be considered as your replacement. ",3,22,52
Jim," Michael, on Thursday I’m going to drive down and interview with David for the open position in New York. ",3,22,52
Jim," Karen suggested that I get a haircut for the interview tomorrow so that I could look presentable and not, as she so lovingly puts it, homeless.   				",3,23,53
Jim," Ahhh… just have so much paperwork to do. [exhales] Wow. Done. Okay, let’s do it.   				",3,23,53
Jim, So I was wondering if Karen and I could get off a few hours early ’cause we want to spend the night in the city. ,3,23,53
Jim," Ah, we’re gonna go tonight, but we’re gonna see you there tomorrow morning, right? ",3,23,53
Jim," Yeah, I’m not going to talk about this now. ",3,23,53
Jim," Uh, hmm. [thinking] Uh, hmm. What else? ",3,23,53
Jim," You know what? Why don’t you take the rest of the day, figure it out and then come back and tell me what you got. ",3,23,53
Jim, You’re not the manager even in your own fantasy? ,3,23,53
Jim," Okay, just so I understand it, in your wildest fantasy you are in Hell and you are co-running a bed and breakfast with the devil? ",3,23,53
Jim," Totally, no problem.  What are you interviewing for, by the way, my assistant? Or…",3,23,53
Jim," Oh wow, that sounds like fun. Is your friend named Karen too?  What did she accomplish? ",3,23,53
Jim," Um, everytime my sixth grade class has a field trip. ",3,23,53
Jim," [Karen punches buttons on an ATM] Yeah, we went to the Spotted Pig for dinner. It’s in the Village. Uh, Karen knew it. And then we second acted Spamalot. That’s when you sneak in at intermission with all the smokers. And then we went to a bar that used to be a church. Oh and at this one bar, I swear I saw Lorne Michaels. ",3,23,53
Jim," Yeah, I do. C’mon. [they hold hands and cross street]  				",3,23,53
Jim," Oh, man.  You know what?  This might take a while.  You really don’t have to stay, if you don’t want.",3,23,53
Jim, I should leave. [pretends to get up] [they laugh],3,23,53
Jim," I’m sorry, wait, so is the question “How’d I get to be so awesome?” [laughs] Because, I don’t have an answer for you. [laughs]",3,23,53
Jim," [not thinking clearly because of Pam’s note] What’s that? Oh, uh, great.  You know?  I just um, I really appreciate the buildings, and uh, the people, and um, there’s just a [sic] energy… New York has, uh…  Not to mention, they have places that are open past eight.  [David laughs] So that’s a… bonus.  ",3,23,53
Jim, [flashback to Beach Games] How are your feet?,3,23,53
Jim, The real reason that I went to Stamford… was because… I wanted to be… not here.,3,23,53
Jim," And even though… I came back, I just, I feel like I’ve never really… come back.",3,23,53
Jim," Pam.  [to camera] Sorry. [to Pam] Um, are you free for dinner tonight?",3,23,53
Jim," I broke up with Karen after the job interview, and uh… it was a little awkward when she came back from the city. She told me, very clearly, just because we were broken up didn’t mean she was going anywhere, because she worked really hard for her career. But the next day her desk was empty, and as for me and my current romantic life, I uh… I’m single now and looking, so if you know anybody.  				",4,1,55
Jim, Oh that sounds fun. I’m mountain biking on Sunday. On Montage Mountain.,4,1,55
Jim, One day Michael came in complaining about a speed bump on the highway. I wonder who he ran over then.  				,4,1,55
Jim, I wouldn’t… I wouldn’t worry about it. Don’t touch it.,4,1,55
Jim, Why won’t more people do that? [laughs],4,1,55
Jim," [Pam and Jim watch video of their kiss on the tv] Oh, ah… No that’s not… I mean that wasn’t, ah…",4,1,55
Jim," I mean I can see how it would seem a bit like we uh… How it looks like um… I mean now a days you can edit anything, right? I mean you can edit anything to look like um… anything.",4,1,55
Jim," Yeah, I mean I personally am definitely on board for the giant check.",4,1,55
Jim," You know what though, I’ve actually seen ads for nurses that you can hire by the hour, for parties and bachelor events.",4,1,55
Jim," Great, it’s gonna cost a couple a hundred buck and ah… oh actually more with tips.",4,1,55
Jim, You couldn’t have taken off all your clothes in the men’s room?,4,1,55
Jim," [naked from chest up] Oh, I’m sorry, is this a working office, and not a French beach?  				",4,1,55
Jim," OK, but what if I told you all the money you spend here, goes to preventing a disease that’s already been cured.",4,1,55
Jim," What are you doing here? Did you come back for us, or…",4,1,55
Jim, Wow! You are a downer. We were having a pretty nice day.,4,1,55
Jim," I’m just gonna grab some chips, you want some?",4,2,56
Jim," I guess. [Pam smiles and walks away, then comes back and kisses Jim on the cheek] How dare you.  				",4,2,56
Jim," Actually, we’ve been dating for a couple months.",4,2,56
Jim," Ohh.. [Michael goes to hug Pam, phone rings]",4,2,56
Jim," Hey. So now that we are dating, uh, we just wanted to know if we had to sign one of those ‘we’re dating’ things for the company.",4,2,56
Jim," Wait a second. Last time I checked, Dunder Mifflin already has a website. And quite frankly, I’m not really sure what’s wrong with it. [Jim at his desk, showing the Dunder Mifflin website reading “Under Construction. Coming Christmas 2002!”]  				",4,2,56
Jim," Swore I wouldn’t tell anyone this, but in the interest of revealing secrets. Oh my God, this will make your brain explode. Umm, Dwight and Angela dating. Have been for six months.",4,2,56
Jim," Swear to God. [Pam shakes her head]. Aww this is great. I was actually gonna wait and tell you on your birthday, but this is much more fun.",4,2,56
Jim, Wait. What? [Pam nods her head] You knew? And you didn’t say anything?,4,2,56
Jim, Fair enough. Wow! We should have started dating like a long time ago.,4,2,56
Jim, And… that is why we waited so long to tell people.  				,4,2,56
Jim," Why do you have the Big picture up again? You used that already, when you burned your foot.",4,2,56
Jim," Oh, please, it was my pleasure.  Well we all came, so… ",4,3,57
Jim,  Whoops.  Is that really what Ryan wanted you to tell us?,4,3,57
Jim, What would you say if I told you we could pull a prank on Dwight and at the same time not be working?,4,3,57
Jim,"  Yeah, I’m aware of that.  But he’s also being super annoying.  And I’m not a perfect person.",4,3,57
Jim, [dictating to Pam] Not sure.  Just became self-aware.  So much to figure out.  I think I am programmed to be your enemy.  I think it is my job to destroy you when it comes to selling paper.,4,3,57
Jim,  Definitely not.  If anything it was a tie.,4,3,57
Jim,"  Okay. Um, while you were typing that I searched every database in existence and learned every fact about everything.  And mastered the violin.  Oop, and sold more paper.    				",4,3,57
Jim,"  Alright, let me just say good-bye to Pam.",4,3,57
Jim,"  Yep.  A long time ago, but, I liked it.",4,3,57
Jim,  It’s not.  It’s different.  But it’s a good book.,4,3,57
Jim,"  Oh, no cause… you’re gonna let me know when we’re close, right?",4,3,57
Jim," Uh, that is an invitation to an online party.",4,3,57
Jim,"  Are there, uh, three w’s at the beginning of the address?",4,3,57
Jim, Oh actually I withdrew from consideration.,4,3,57
Jim, Michael just called the pizza place with a list of demands.,4,3,57
Jim," Hey, quick question.  If I take a pizza, do you think you could take some sodas and some napkins up to the roof?",4,3,57
Jim," Yeah, cheese, or do we have other flavors?",4,3,57
Jim," Do you remember what you said to me on my first day of work, just before you walked me over to my desk?",4,3,57
Jim, That was the moment that you knew you liked me?,4,3,57
Jim," Wow, can we make it a different moment?",4,3,57
Jim," A toast, better make it good.  To avoiding a class two felony charge.",4,3,57
Jim, Does the Department of Health know about this?,4,4,58
Jim," That reminds me, uh, if the invitation still stands, Pam and I would love to have dinner tonight.",4,4,58
Jim," I can’t believe this place is real. I mean, I’ve heard about his beet farm for years, but wow.",4,4,58
Jim, Yes. We will be requiring a bed time story.,4,4,58
Jim," Oh, I thought you asked me what our chances were in being murdered here tonight.  ",4,4,58
Jim," You know, I’ve just realized, this is Pam’s and my first night away together. I use to play it over my head, and it was just a little bit different. Maybe a uh, nice hotel. Or a romantic dinner. Wine… uh but, wine that wasn’t made out of beets. Didn’t think Dwight would be involved at all. And uh, I always imagined less manure. I mean, some manure, just… less.",4,4,58
Jim," [Jim and Pam hear noise] Wait, you’re going up there?",4,4,58
Jim," Just thought that I heard crying, moaning, or something in here.",4,4,58
Jim," Good night, Dwight. [Jim leaves, Dwight continues crying]  ",4,4,58
Jim, Have you checked Trip Advisor recently?,4,4,58
Jim, The dawn goose walk will tug at your heartstrings.,4,4,58
Jim, You will never want to leave your room.,4,4,58
Jim, Did I ever tell you why I left Scranton?,4,4,58
Jim," Yeah, I didn’t think I had.  Well, it was all about Pam.",4,4,58
Jim," Yeah, I mean she was with Roy, and, uh, I just couldn’t take it.  I mean, I lost it Dwight.  I couldn’t sleep, I couldn’t concentrate on anything.  Even weird stuff, like food had no taste.  So my solution was to move away.  It was awful.  It was something that I wouldn’t wish on my worst enemy, and that includes you.",4,4,58
Jim," Ah, dinner.  Let’s see, maybe we should try the new Italian place, where the drive-in used to be.",4,4,58
Jim," Yep, I’m very passionate about Italian food.  In fact, um, I’m in love with Italian food.  ",4,4,58
Jim," Break me off a piece of that applesauce, I don’t think…",4,5,59
Jim," I think it’s great that the company’s making a commercial because not very many people have heard of us. I mean, when I tell people that I work at Dunder Mifflin, they think that we sell mufflers, or muffins, or mittens, or… And frankly all of those sound better than paper, so I let it slide.  				",4,5,59
Jim," Who are you talking to, specifically?  				",4,5,59
Jim," Why don’t we take a quick ten second break from that so I can show you what’s going on here. [pulls up Dwight’s game] Okay, this is Dwight’s Second Life. He’s on it all the time. So much so that his little guy here has created his own world. It’s called Second Second Life, for those people who want to be removed even further from reality. ",4,5,59
Jim," Not much, it’s just for tracking Dwight so—  ",4,5,59
Jim, I… why don’t we go back to this animation.,4,5,59
Jim," I hope you’re not killing yourself on this, because I’m sure it’s good enough for Michael’s ad that will probably be seen by no one. ",4,5,59
Jim," Pam is staying late tonight to uh, achieve her dreams. So I’m pretty proud of her, unfortunately she was my ride home.",4,5,59
Jim," Good morning. [Pam sees breakfast sitting on her desk] Yeah I’m sorry, I looked away for a second and Creed snatched your hash browns.",4,5,59
Jim," Hey, could you do me a favor? Could you put that in the DVD player?   				",4,5,59
Jim," Hey everybody! Just want to welcome you all to the premiere of the real Dunder Mifflin commercial, the Michael Scott director’s cut. Hope you like it.   				",4,5,59
Jim, Animation? All her by the way. [points at Pam],4,5,59
Jim," Oh, I don’t think that is what’s happening.",4,6,60
Jim, So tell me again why I can’t be part of your club?,4,6,60
Jim, I can’t believe you guys.  I’m not going to go further piss off my ex-girlfriend.,4,6,60
Jim," Well, that kind of sucks, because it had all the photos of my brother’s new baby on it, so…",4,6,60
Jim, You know what?  I’m just going to call a cab from here.,4,6,60
Jim," Alright.  Wait, what are you planning on doing?",4,6,60
Jim," No, no absolutely we are not doing this.",4,6,60
Jim, Are you kidding me?  We’ve been driving around with this stuff in the trunk the whole time?,4,6,60
Jim," So the deal was, Dwight doesn’t blow anything up, and I wear a costume.  And a moustache.  				",4,6,60
Jim,  Why don’t we play that alphabet game that you were talking about?,4,6,60
Jim," I can’t believe we’re here, I can’t believe this is happening.",4,6,60
Jim," Oh my God, that’s her! That’s her, go, go, go.",4,6,60
Jim," Shut up, you, shut up!  This is the dumbest thing we’ve ever done.  				",4,6,60
Jim," Okay, you know what?  You don’t need to be updating me as much as you’re updating me.",4,6,60
Jim," Alright, Great Scott, if you found that choking hazard poster, just head on home.",4,6,60
Jim," No, that is a terrible idea, don’t do this.",4,6,60
Jim," Okay! First of all, stop using my name.  And second of all-",4,6,60
Jim," You good?  I’m just checking on the other branches.  Michael wants me to do that from time to time, so…",4,6,60
Jim," Oh no, I didn’t want to see you.  Not that I’m not happy seeing you, right now, I’m just saying ultimately I was here for the copier.  Equal, I’d say it was equal.  So, good to see you…",4,6,60
Jim," I mean, it’s just that- [clears throat] You know, Pam and I are still dating, so, and, I just mean that things are going really well, so I didn’t want to see… you…",4,6,60
Jim," [slinking out of the room] Alright, you are welcome.  I’m going to go because of, um, traffic.",4,6,60
Jim, I… will… [gives up and walks away]  				,4,6,60
Jim, Are you inviting me to the Finer Things Club?,4,6,60
Jim," [Irish accent] Angela’s Ashes, top o’ the morning to us.  Frankie’s prose is funnier than a pot of gold, say I.",4,6,60
Jim," Yep.  No, I mean I really liked it.  I thought was uh, a fun read.",4,6,60
Jim," When Michael plays the hypothetical game, I always say yes.   				",4,7,61
Jim," Oh, can’t go today, ’cause I’m donating blood. ",4,7,61
Jim," Hmm, no, the choice is actually yours. Are you sure you want to do this? ",4,7,61
Jim," You know what, I have an idea. Why don’t we just do one big shared party?",4,7,61
Jim," There are thirteen people working in this office, so thirteen times a year Michael gets a cake and balloons, and some sort of joke gift and makes a toast. There are two types of toasts. One is a joke about how old you are.  				",4,7,61
Jim," And the other is something inappropriate. Or horrible. Or both. What else? He only sings the high harmony to “Happy Birthday.” And he’s a very big believer in surprise parties. Maybe even, arguably, possibly to a fault.  				",4,7,61
Jim," So… I think, yeah, I think getting these out of the way might be productive.  				",4,7,61
Jim," We can just have one big fun party. Everybody’s happy, nobody wastes their time.",4,7,61
Jim," It’s a pretty good idea, don’t you think?",4,7,61
Jim," You know, try sending them another invoice.",4,7,61
Jim," Alright. [starts walking away, but returns] Oh, did you see my memo by the way? ",4,7,61
Jim, Right! Exactly. [pats Oscar on the back and walks away] Knew I could count on you. [Oscar rolls his eyes]  				,4,7,61
Jim," Well, I’m gonna to talk to Angela and we’re gonna see what we can do about a pie.",4,7,61
Jim," Alright, I’ll look into it, but the answer’s no.",4,7,61
Jim," OK, I’m gonna go into this office here [gets up and walks into Michael’s office] to do some work. So I will be in here.",4,7,61
Jim," Toby’s great. He’s great, but sometimes he can be a little bit much. [in Toby voice] I don’t see the harm in that. Well, it’s a cake Toby, so, c’mon.  				",4,7,61
Jim," OK. Yeah, you know what, we’re just gonna throw you in. Because more the merrier, right?",4,7,61
Jim," That’s a bummer. OK, then we need to…[steps outside office] Hey everybody. Hi, how you doing? Can I have your attention please?  ‘Cause we have to talk about this birthday thing. ",4,7,61
Jim," Yes, conference room in five minutes… No. No. We’re gonna solve it right here. We’re actually gonna talk about it out here. So, who has problems with the birthday thing? [everyone raises hands] One, two, three, everybody. OK, so then we just shouldn’t do it. ",4,7,61
Jim," Yup, Phyllis called me Michael. And I will always and forever be haunted by that fact.   				",4,7,61
Jim," Well, I tried to put all the birthdays together at once.",4,7,61
Jim," Well, I don’t think I’ll be here in ten years.",4,7,61
Jim,"  No, I didn’t. [Michael laughs] You know why?",5,1,63
Jim,"  Because most of the time, friends don’t talk about other friends’ butts.",5,1,63
Jim,"  Come on, man. She goes to New York in like 10 minutes.",5,1,63
Jim,"  Why haven’t I proposed yet? Uh, actually Pam and I talked about it. And we just decided that, um — well, we didn’t want to spend first three months of our engagement apart. And Pam’s always said she doesn’t want a long engagement. Something in her past, I guess. I’m not really sure of the whole story, but something about a guy who used to work here…  				",5,1,63
Jim,"  I can’t believe I’m saying this, but Michael is actually killing it with Holly. And I think I know why. It’s because Holly is kind of a major dork.  				",5,1,63
Jim,"  I don’t really know Ronnie. But I have a feeling I will get to know her very well over the next few years, and eventually declare my love for her.  				",5,1,63
Jim,"  When Michael told us that Jan was pregnant, he led us to believe that he was the father. By telling us that he was the father.  				",5,1,63
Jim,"  All right, I am connecting and … you are not there. Did you install it right? How about this:  Go to applications–",5,1,63
Jim,"  So what is going on, girl in the computer?",5,1,63
Jim,"  Oh, that’s so rude of me. Have you seen, um, Pam’s new art? It’s right there. Check it out. [closes door]  				",5,1,63
Jim,  [watching baseball game on TV] Some girl came into Pam’s room crying about her roommate stealing her soy milk. So I’m in here waiting it out.  				,5,1,63
Jim,  Well that’s great.  [shakes Ryan’s hand] You’re talking about your court ordered community service?,5,1,63
Jim,"  How much weight have you lost, Dwight?",5,1,63
Jim,"  Probably the weirdest thing about Pam being gone would be lunch… actually.  But um, it will force me to become acquaintances with people I consider… coworkers.  				",5,1,63
Jim,"  See, you’re always saying there’s something wrong with society, but… maybe there’s something wrong with you.",5,1,63
Jim,  Summers going great.  Just spent two hours listening to Michael Clump.  I have a weird pain in my left side that I’m convinced is an ulcer.  My girlfriend lives in New York and I haven’t seen her in 10 days.  How’s your summer?  				,5,1,63
Jim,"  So as it turns out, tonight is my nephews T-ball game and I kinda missed the first three, so…",5,1,63
Jim,  I’m gonna write you up for not working.,5,1,63
Jim, [holds up an ASCII image of Dwight]  				,5,1,63
Jim,"  Hey, Michael.  I just scheduled lunch with a client so I might be back a little late.",5,1,63
Jim, Ah.  That… they might be off the hook for because I… didn’t tell them.,5,2,64
Jim," OK.  You know what?  Here we go. [stands up] Uh, everybody?  I just want to make an announcement.  Pam and I are engaged.",5,2,64
Jim," Dwight, you’ve really never stolen any company time?",5,2,64
Jim," [starts a stopwatch as Dwight yawns, stops it when Dwight is done] Yawn.  Four seconds.",5,2,64
Jim, Oh you had said that you don’t do anything personal during work time so… I’m just making sure.,5,2,64
Jim, Personal conversation.  Seventeen seconds.,5,2,64
Jim," By any chance, did you see Battlestar Galactica last night?",5,2,64
Jim," I mean I like all the crazy monsters and stuff.  You know, like klingons and wookies and all that but… [Dwight begins to turn around again, Jim holds up the watch] Sorry, was there something you wanted to add, Dwight?",5,2,64
Jim," You know, it’s weird.  It’s practically a shot for shot remake.",5,2,64
Jim, Story’s kinda bland.  It’s about this guy named Dumbledore Calrissian who needs to return the ring back to Mordor.,5,2,64
Jim," He has not stopped working for a second.  At 12:45 he sneezed while keeping his eyes open, which I always thought was impossible.  At 1:32 he peed, and I know that because he did it in an open soda bottle under the desk while filling out expense reports.  And on the flip side, I have been so busy watching him that I haven’t even started work.  It’s exhausting, being this vigilant.  I’ll probably have to go home early today.  				",5,2,64
Jim, [Dwight walks back to his desk] 19 minutes and 48 seconds.  What were we doing for 19 minutes and 48 seconds?,5,2,64
Jim, So I guess I can assume that was personal.,5,2,64
Jim, So maybe you’re not completely ethical after all.,5,2,64
Jim," [drawing two family trees on a whiteboard] Jan is about to have a baby with a sperm donor. And Michael is preparing for the birth of a watermelon with Dwight.  Now, this baby will be related to Michael through [draws a question mark] delusion.  				",5,3,65
Jim," OK, I’ll ta…I’ll talk to you later. [hangs up]  That was a good story.",5,3,65
Jim," [Jan enters the office, pushing a stroller] Jan.",5,3,65
Jim," OK, OK, so you gotta hear this.  So, Jan’s shower is going on right now, and she’s singing “Son of a Preacher Man” and everyone’s just staring at her.",5,3,65
Jim,"   The song is about losing your virginity next to a church, and guess what – she’s been singing for the last twenty minutes!",5,3,65
Jim," Oh. OK, well you know what, I um, just call me later.",5,3,65
Jim," [on voicemail] Hey, it’s Jim.  Leave a message.",5,3,65
Jim," [walking to his car] Hey, it’s me.  It is 5:03.",5,3,65
Jim," Is it me, or are we just a little off today?",5,3,65
Jim, Hope you didn’t have any major laundry issues.,5,3,65
Jim, Remember that time that I helped you do your laundry and that crazy guy came in and started yelling at you?,5,3,65
Jim," Yet here you are, back in a Laundromat.  Now, I’m just trying to help you, Beesly.  Be safe.",5,3,65
Jim," So apparently Pam went out last night, and accidentally called my work phone at 3:00 in the morning.",5,4,66
Jim, The future mother of my children.  				,5,4,66
Jim," Another round, boys? Great. [Jim walks to the bar]",5,4,66
Jim," She’s, um, she’s in New York. She’s at an art school.",5,4,66
Jim," Yeah, I’d say she’s happy. I mean, she loves her classes. Loves the city. I mean, last night, she was out with her friends, till, like, 8:00 AM.",5,4,66
Jim, [driving] I am going to see Pam. Because I feel like I should. [sighs]  				,5,4,66
Jim," [driving, sighs, laughs] No. you know what? No. Because… I’m not that guy. And [laughs] we are not that couple. [turns around]  				",5,4,66
Jim," [phone] Oh, hang on one second. Jim Halpert.",5,5,67
Jim, All right. We’ll see. [to camera] No.  				,5,5,67
Jim," I am off to New York. My brother Pete from Boston, and my brother Tom from New Jersey are taking Pam and I out for lunch, to celebrate the engagement. Or maybe to beat me up. I can never tell with those two.   				",5,5,67
Jim, All right so now we can sit… and get comfortable.  				,5,5,67
Jim, That’s not really true. There’s a lot of things you can do with an art degree actually.,5,5,67
Jim," Wow, that’s- that’s a little rude. What’s your deal?",5,5,67
Jim," Oh wow. This is my niece Vanessa. She’s a trumpeter. And, look at her.",5,5,67
Jim, That must be really fun for you and Marci huh?,5,5,67
Jim, Here you go again! What is your deal today?,5,5,67
Jim, Pete couldn’t make the Mets. She’s at Pratt. You played JV baseball. Will you lighten up a little bit?,5,5,67
Jim," Guys, what is going on?!  [Pete and Tom burst out in laughter]",5,5,67
Jim," Well, I’ll be the judge of that. What do you got?",5,5,67
Jim," Truthfully anything would have been better than that prank. [laughs] Oh, text message from my brother. “Pam cool. Welcome to the family.”",5,5,67
Jim," Those reports affect our bonuses, which is kind of great for me, because you wouldn’t know it from looking at her, but Pam’s a gold-digger.",5,6,68
Jim," [on Bluetooth] Testing, testing. Hello, everybody.",5,6,68
Jim," Oh, sorry. It was just — it was right here.",5,6,68
Jim," OK. Or maybe I could finish the coffee that’s in here and you could use [finds a mug] uh, oh — Snoopy.",5,6,68
Jim," [holds mug next to Andy’s head] Make the face. [Andy smiles] Yeah, I don’t see it.",5,6,68
Jim, Wow. That was Dwight. He seems upset about something.,5,6,68
Jim," It is… more of a spicy brown, actually.",5,6,68
Jim, Absolutely. Or you could just be nice to your customers.,5,6,68
Jim," Well, there’s got to be an explanation.",5,6,68
Jim," I need a decent bonus, because I’m actually in the process of buying my parents’ house so that they can retire. And if history tells us anything, it’s that you can’t go wrong buying a house you can’t afford. Pam doesn’t know about the house, so it’s… a fun surprise. [taps Bluetooth earpiece] Pam, sorry about that. I lost you for a second. So, as it turns out, I may not have done so hot on my customer reviews this year.",5,6,68
Jim," Wow, that’s great, because I need paper.",5,6,68
Jim," How dare you? My family built this country, by the way.",5,6,68
Jim, Would you hold on one second? That’s my other line.,5,6,68
Jim," Hello? [laughs] No, I’m just on the phone with this stupid salesman. He’s so dumb. Probably just gonna keep him on the line forever and not buy anything. Yeah, OK. [punches button on phone]",5,6,68
Jim," Sorry, you’re going to have to speak up a little bit louder. I’m hard of hearing.",5,6,68
Jim," The three words I would describe you as is aggressive, hostile and definitely difficult.",5,6,68
Jim," Well, I should hope so. [Michael takes phone] Who is this?",5,6,68
Jim," Michael, I like the sound of your voice. You know what I’m going to do? I’m going to buy one million dollars worth of paper products today.",5,6,68
Jim, You have to fire the salesman that treated me so terribly.,5,6,68
Jim, Dwight. Dwight. [Dwight’s car comes screeching into view],5,6,68
Jim, [turns radio down] What are you thinking?,5,6,68
Jim, Let’s just — Let’s head back to the desk.,5,6,68
Jim," [enters breakroom] Hey. Sorry about Dwight, by the way.",5,6,68
Jim," Well, we all handle it differently. I personally choose to handle it like a normal person, but…",5,6,68
Jim, Do you have any reason to believe that Kelly would be mad at me?,5,6,68
Jim, I wasn’t. But thank you. [to Pam] Do you know anything about this party?,5,6,68
Jim," Well, I can’t be the only one who didn’t — [sees mugs on Angela’s and Meredith’s desks]  ",5,6,68
Jim," [walks quickly to break room, opens cabinet and finds mugs of Oscar, Creed and Phyllis]  ",5,6,68
Jim," OK, I’m gonna assume that was it. Here’s the thing:",5,6,68
Jim," No, no, no, no. Dwight, Dwight, Dwight. Let’s talk about this.  ",5,6,68
Jim," We called about a dozen customers, and they all said that they gave us great marks.",5,6,68
Jim," Oh, that’s gonna be great. Who’s Chuck Close?",5,6,68
Jim, That’s it. I want to talk to this guy. Put me in his ear.,5,6,68
Jim, I’m gonna make a bigger leap here. He is into you.,5,6,68
Jim, Six point five days. [winces as Kevin smacks him on the back],5,7,69
Jim, Pam comes back from New York next week and everyone here has just been so excited for me. And involved. And intrusive. And weird.  				,5,7,69
Jim," Okay, okay, it’s no big deal.  So you’re not a computer geek.",5,7,69
Jim," It’s not— It’s not about me.  I mean, this your dream.",5,7,69
Jim, And you went to New York to do this.  So when you come back you come back the right way. Right?,5,7,69
Jim," Love you too. [hangs up phone, Pam sits on a bench crying]  				",5,7,69
Jim, [noticing that everyone is giving him a sympathetic look] How does everyone know already?,5,7,69
Jim," [laughing] She’s probably going to, cause they sit next to each other.",5,8,70
Jim," You should probably just meander back there; take a look.  See if he’s, see if he’s back.",5,8,70
Jim," Yeah, I am.  Wait, how do you know that?  I didn’t tell you that.",5,8,70
Jim," Yeah, I guess technically Kev, you’re right.  				",5,8,70
Jim," Today’s a big day.  Today’s the day that I show Pam the house that I bought for us. Without telling her. But it’s my parent’s house, the house I grew up in and yeah, I bought it kind of impulsively. I mean, the price was good and I was helping out my mom.  It’s got shag carpets.  I mean you can’t blame my parents it was the 70’s.  And why would you want to buy ugly wood from trees when you can have paneling? And a painting of some creepy clowns that is apparently crucial to the structural integrity of the building. [tugs and pulls in vain at the clown painting]  She’s gonna love it.  Right?  				",5,8,70
Jim, Could you guys all do me a favor and not talk about this until I tell Pam?,5,8,70
Jim," Oh, it’s on uh Linden Ave?  By the quarry?",5,8,70
Jim," Oh totally.  Sorry, are we talking about the microwave still?",5,8,70
Jim, [laughs and swings his arm out which doesn’t come close to touching the reception desk] I’m always this close.,5,8,70
Jim," Yes, I just have to take this call anyway so…",5,8,70
Jim," [walking out of the building] Hey, do you mind if we make a stop on the way home?",5,8,70
Jim," I have a surprise for you.  All right, ready?  Close your eyes and now [spins her around once] open your eyes.  Tadah!",5,8,70
Jim," I bought it.  It’s ours.  Let’s go inside, I’ll show you inside.  [walking inside] So if you can believe it I did it without a realtor.  Saving on closing costs is good and, uh, we can put all the money to de-shag the carpet.  Which I think will help, the color situation. [Pam walks over to the clown painting on the wall]  Yeah, I am really sorry about this.  I tried to move it but he is really nailed in there.  Worried about art theft, I guess, lot of art theives in this neighborhood.  [upstairs] This is the master bedroom but, I’m actually not allowed in here so… [shuts the door]  				",5,8,70
Jim," [outside] So I’m still in the process of converting the garage.  It’s got great light in here and I’m thinking, it could be perfect [opens garage door] for an art studio.  [Pam looks around and then looks at him] Look, I know, I bought this without asking you and it’s doesn’t look great, I know that.  And if you really hate it, I totally understand it’s just—",5,8,70
Jim," No, No, we’ll just board that up.  It’ll be that weird spare room that people ask us about.",5,8,70
Jim," Yeah, I can’t… really can’t move him.  				",5,8,70
Jim," Uh, actually, I’m gonna go with copier.",5,9,71
Jim," Ever since Pam and I started dating, I just feel weird asking her to make copies for me. So, I make my own copies. And that copier sucks. Let me tell you, I-But you know what? Pam and I don’t have to agree on everything.  				",5,9,71
Jim, Ahh… I got you some tiramisu. No hard feelings.,5,9,71
Jim," [Pam is making copies and is struggling with the machine] You might want to consider changing teams, because we would-we would love to have you.",5,9,71
Jim," [on the phone] We have that going out Tuesday… Okay? Sure, no, I can… I’ll double-check that for you.",5,9,71
Jim," Yeah, you did win. You did win. Anyway, I’m going to need three copies of each of these, stapled and collated. [begins to walk away, then turns back] Totally kidding. [leans in, whispers] I’m gonna need four. [kisses Pam]  				",5,9,71
Jim, Five minutes actually.  I am a black belt in gift wrapping.,5,10,72
Jim, I think it’ll take you a little longer than that.,5,10,72
Jim, Ah. You brought in your doll collection.,5,10,72
Jim, Stupid.  Everyone knows to ask for a hundred more wishes. [Pam laughs] Dumb.,5,10,72
Jim," [Meredith’s hair is on fire] Oh, oh, oh, oh!",5,10,72
Jim, Ah… would you want to do it on Groundhogs day?,5,10,72
Jim," Yeah, but you’re gonna need a permit for that.",5,10,72
Jim," Michael, I think… you did the best you could, but this is bigger than all of us.",5,10,72
Jim, [watching Meredith and Michael talk in his office] They’ve been in there for 45 minutes.,5,10,72
Jim, Please stop. People are having a Christmas party.  				,5,10,72
Jim," No, no, no, it’s not your turn. All right, thirteen is the new number. Oscar, go ahead.",5,11,73
Jim," [getting up quickly to silence Michael] No, no. Nope.",5,11,73
Jim, How about we just… Just have to talk to you for a second…,5,11,73
Jim," Andy still doesn’t know that Angela’s having an affair with Dwight. And it’s been seventeen days. I mean, eventually he’ll figure it out, when their kids have giant heads and beet-stained teeth. But right now it’s just… awkward.  				",5,11,73
Jim, This is really not how this is supposed to happen.,5,11,73
Jim, This shouldn’t be coming from his boss. And we should also consider the fact that that man has an anger issue.,5,11,73
Jim," Well it’s not too late, because you haven’t done anything.",5,11,73
Jim, You’re not going to do anything to his neck or his groin.,5,11,73
Jim," Dwight, I’m in charge when Michael’s gone, and I need you to sit…",5,11,73
Jim," Hey guys, why don’t we, uh, just cool off a bit?",5,11,73
Jim," Okay, you know what? That’s enough. Because…",5,11,73
Jim, Hey. It is my business when it happens at work.,5,11,73
Jim," So, I either get more involved, or I take a sick day… leaving Dwight in charge. Oh God.  				",5,11,73
Jim, [collects Dwight’s weapons from around the office; holds up a hand scythe],5,11,73
Jim," Well it’s a computer Dwight, computers have wires. ",5,12,74
Jim," Dwight, I am really busy, I can’t talk about this anymore. [Dwight follows red cord through office past Phyllis’ and Stanley’s desks]",5,12,74
Jim," I got 500 feet of red wire at a flea market up by Dunmore High School. 20 bucks for the whole spool. Crazy, what a deal. [behind Jim, Dwight climbs telephone pole] Oh he’ll be fine. I made it up there.  ",5,12,74
Jim," Guys, she is a beautiful movie star, so maybe we should just go to work.",5,12,74
Jim," Okay, okay, okay. Why don’t we just put this to a vote, and then we’ll be done with it.",5,12,74
Jim," [snaps back] No one cares. Who thinks that Hillary Swank is hot, raise your hand. [half of office raises hand] Okay, and who thinks Hillary Swank is not hot, raise your hand. [other half of office raises hand]",5,12,74
Jim," I think all of us have a tendency to view celebrities as sort of mythical figures, you know? We don’t really see them as real so therefore we don’t judge them as real people.",5,12,74
Jim," Kevin, you know what, why don’t you close your eyes? Imagine that Hilary Swank comes into this office for real and she walks over to you [in a more and more seductive voice] and says Kevin Malone, I just read your online profile and there is nothing I would rather do then make out with you right now. And now you tell me something, is she hot? [Kevin gets up to join the “hot” team to their great joy] Does that end the debate? ",5,12,74
Jim," [entire office is chatting] I’m saying, all I’m saying is Kevin is not necessarily a feminist, is all I’m saying.",5,12,74
Jim," Okay, I am not dying here.  Come on. [everyone is coughing from the smoke, Dwight lights some fire crackers and they start popping]",5,13,75
Jim," No, no, no! Don’t give him mouth to mouth for this! ",5,13,75
Jim, [everyone shouting at once] Michael! Michael!,5,13,75
Jim, [after Pam checks her cell phone] What’s going on?  				,5,13,75
Jim," Uh, no one really knows, but Pam’s parents are going through a little bit of a rough patch in their marriage.  				",5,13,75
Jim," I mean, they just need to communicate, you know?  If they said to each other what they’re saying to everyone else, then–",5,13,75
Jim, [to Pam] Can you believe this? [pause] He was pretty talkative at breakfast.,5,13,75
Jim," Mmm… nope, we mostly just talked about cereal.",5,13,75
Jim," [laughs] I’m ok, I’m not, great, and um… [nods]  				",5,13,75
Jim," Oh my God. Pam, I don’t know, I, nothing, truly, nothing. I mean, I, I just was honest with him and I, I’m so sorry, I don’t know. I’ll call him again. [Pam rolls her eyes and walks away]  				",5,13,75
Jim," Fifty percent of marriages end in divorce, so… it was her parents or my parents…   				",5,13,75
Jim," Several times a day, Michael says words that are way beyond my vocabulary.",5,13,75
Jim," OK. ‘Cause the quote was, cut off your nose to spiderface.",5,13,75
Jim," That’s pretty funny. Hey you know what? Did I drop my, uh…",5,14,76
Jim," What the heck? Is that, uh… [bends down, cuts phone cords with scissors]",5,14,76
Jim," [front door slams, Kelly walks by] Hey, Kelly.",5,14,76
Jim, [Jim and Dwight sitting next to each other in talking head interview] Go ahead.,5,14,76
Jim," Basically after Phyllis blackmailed Angela, Michael asked them to both step down from the party planning committee cause there was too much drama.",5,14,76
Jim," [pushes Dwight’s finger away] Just, easy.",5,14,76
Jim, Party planning is literally the stupidest thing I have ever done in my life.,5,14,76
Jim, We just wanted to say we are very sorry.,5,14,76
Jim, [while Dwight and Kelly are arguing] Guys guys guys guys guys guys. We just want to make it up to you. What can we do?,5,14,76
Jim, [partially blown up balloons on table and hanging from streamers] Are you kidding?,5,14,76
Jim," Dwight. This, [picks up balloon] fits in the palm of my hand. You haven’t blown ’em up enough. Why have you chosen brown and gray balloons?",5,14,76
Jim, What is that? [looks at sign that says “IT IS YOUR BIRTHDAY.”] It is your birthday period.,5,14,76
Jim," Look, I’m at the supermarket, and they only have numbered candles. How old is she?",5,14,76
Jim, Do you think I’m calling you for your best approximation?,5,14,76
Jim, [leaning against Creed’s desk] So I am collecting $3 from everybody. For Kelly’s party.,5,14,76
Jim," Hey, Dwight, sounds like she was 14, so maybe we wanna go a little easy. ",5,15,77
Jim, I forgot if there was an “e” between the “l” and the “y.” I still don’t know.  ,5,15,77
Jim," Okay, you know what, next time, I’ll let you get the cake and I get to scream at the birthday girl.  ",5,15,77
Jim," Okay, so all we need is a theme… and cups, and ice, and punch, and a cake.",5,15,77
Jim," Hey, what’s that show that she’s always talking about?",5,15,77
Jim, You know what? I could use a little help.,5,15,77
Jim," We have a lot to do, and you are… putting up a very effeminate sign. Is that what you’ve been doing, is making a sign?",5,15,77
Jim," You’ve been making that sign, for something that we could just announce to the whole office? Hey everybody, the party’s now at 3!",5,15,77
Jim," I’m not writing, “Horse Hunt.” I don’t even know what that means.",5,15,77
Jim," [grunts] Okay, so far, our ideal party consists of beer, fights to the death, cupcakes, blood pudding, blood, touch football, mating, charades, and yes, horse hunting.",5,15,77
Jim," Look, is there a birthday you remember that you loved?",5,15,77
Jim," Okay, stop. Forever stop that story. That’s disgusting, and it doesn’t count. So give me another one.",5,15,77
Jim," Actually, when I was seven, my Dad took me to the Natural History Museum in New York. And we looked at fossils all day. And at the end of the day, he got me a little plastic triceratops. It was awesome.",5,15,77
Jim, [to camera] Didn’t see that one coming.  ,5,15,77
Jim," What?! You have a cake. You have a delicious cake, with your name spelled correctly?",5,15,77
Jim," That’s the best part. That represents a pillow, or a television.",5,15,77
Jim," Because the fun part is, you get to decide on an hour of television, or an hour of napping.",5,15,77
Jim," Ahem. This is for you… and [puts blanket around her shoulders] …Happy Birthday, Kel.",5,15,77
Jim," [approaching Reception] Michael Scott, manager.  Hi, how are ya?",5,16,78
Jim," Nice to meet you, yeah.  Whew!  I can assure you we don’t need a new system though.  Happy with ours.",5,16,78
Jim," You’re only engaged once.  Well present company excluded, but.",5,16,78
Jim, Yeah.  [Jim leans in for a kiss but Pam turns away]  She’s fine.  				,5,16,78
Jim," Uh, I actually thought we were keeping it pretty low-key.",5,16,78
Jim, I have a lot of work to do this afternoon.  Those mines aren’t gonna sweep themselves.,5,16,78
Jim, But! That girl must’ve had monstrous hands because the holes fit.,5,16,78
Jim, I think if you ordered hot food you’re allowed to eat.,5,16,78
Jim," We should help him out. [Jim and Pam each take a French fry, eat it, and then look toward the bathroom]  				",5,16,78
Jim," No, just kidding.  Seriously though, that’s enough.",5,16,78
Jim," Well they didn’t dine so, yeah, maybe they just dashed.",5,16,78
Jim, The KGB will wait for no one! [Michael laughs],5,17,79
Jim, We own our own delivery trucks. We could lease them out on the weekends —,5,17,79
Jim," [to Kevin] Why don’t you just go out on a date with her? Try to spark up an on going joke and then in a month or two, if it feels right, you’ll know. ",5,17,79
Jim," [on phone] Hey, Tom. What’s that? Oh, you found a golden ticket. [puts hand on receiver and speaks to office] One of my clients found a golden ticket. [Michael screams in excitement] [Jim back on phone] Yup. No, congratulations. [Michael dances in background]",5,17,79
Jim, [on phone] I’ll take that down right now. ,5,17,79
Jim, [to Michael] It’s actually Blue Cross from Pennsylvania. ,5,17,79
Jim," [on phone] Hold on one sec. Hold on one sec, Tom, what’s that? You found five golden tickets? And does it say limit one per customer? Nope, it doesn’t.   ",5,17,79
Jim, How do you not spread out the tickets into different shipments? ,5,17,79
Jim, …well I’m going to call corporate to make sure that they know I didn’t lose half my sales.,5,17,79
Jim," So, well I lost a ton of money today and I have a mortgage, so I’m a little pissed too. ",5,17,79
Jim," All I’m saying is that it’s a first dates, so just keep a respectful distance. ",5,17,79
Jim, He can do the same for you. Right now. By getting fired instead of you. So what are you gonna do? ,5,17,79
Jim," You, you are taking about Dwight Schrute. The biggest Wonka fan I know. I mean, you’ve been talking about that movie for years.",5,17,79
Jim, And you know what? I even made fun of you when you dressed up as Willy Wonka to pitch this idea and for that I apologize. ,5,17,79
Jim," Yeah, let’s face it. This meeting sounds like it’s Wonka fans only. He’s never seen the movie. [David laughs] ",5,17,79
Jim," Alright. I just got out of the shower, I’ll be one second. ",5,17,79
Jim," Yeah, I’m late for work, so I have to brush my teeth, it’s a whole routine. ",5,17,79
Jim," If you want to come back then, that’ll be fine. ",5,17,79
Jim,"  This… is Parkour. [turns laptop to camera, shows Parkour instructional video] Internet sensation of 2004. And it was in one of the Bond films. It’s pretty impressive. [Michael is shown climbing/walking on various objects in office] The goal is to get from point A to point B as creatively as possible, so technically they are doing Parkour, as long as point A is delusion and point B is the hospital.",6,1,81
Jim," Well, with her being unmarried… knocked up by some guy, I mean the yakity-yaks in this office would have a field day.",6,1,81
Jim, No shotgun… ’cause that changes everything.,6,1,81
Jim," What are you gonna do about it? There’s no shotgun, so… free at last, free at last!",6,1,81
Jim, [approaching Michael] You have to stop this.,6,1,81
Jim, I did. From you. You gotta stop telling people.,6,1,81
Jim, Do you know if it’s true? Do you have any idea? Because you might be ruining his life.,6,1,81
Jim, [to Eric] You’re gonna regret that when you find yourself between a moose and her cubs.,6,1,81
Jim," Oh, I don’t really do that. But Pam might have some friends, though.",6,1,81
Jim, Are you… interested in her guy friends?,6,1,81
Jim, [grabs Pam by the arm] Can I talk to you for a second?,6,1,81
Jim," [whispering to Pam in corner of room] So, they know.",6,1,81
Jim, I didn’t tell anyone! Who did you tell?,6,1,81
Jim," Hey, has everyone heard a crazy rumor about themselves today?",6,1,81
Jim," Yeah, sure, but… who’s been saying all that stuff?",6,1,81
Jim," [arm around Pam] Thank you for trying to defend her. But actually, Pam is pregnant, and we can prove it.",6,1,81
Jim," Michael, we only told our parents last week.",6,1,81
Jim," [gets up to leave room, Michael gestures for him to stay]",6,1,81
Jim," [hangs up Michael’s phone, leaves room]  				",6,1,81
Jim,"   Ah, this is just me and David, if that’s okay.",6,2,82
Jim,"   No, I won’t.   Alright, thanks for giving me your time,  I appreciate it.  ",6,2,82
Jim,"   I didn’t tell Michael because I thought he’d try to help.  Example, he handed out Jello shots at the 23rd mile of the Steamtown marathon.    				",6,2,82
Jim,"   When you were in the office earlier talking to Wallace, did I come up at all?  ",6,2,82
Jim,   Why don’t we head in your office to talk?  ,6,2,82
Jim,"   Michael, look I’ll just be honest with you.  Earlier today I spoke with Wallace about a promotion.  I actually think that talk went really well.  And then after he spoke with you, for some reason it felt like things had changed.  ",6,2,82
Jim,   I tried to keep Michael in the dark.  I should have known that he can do just as much damage in the dark.    				,6,2,82
Jim,   How many times have I asked you to put me up for a branch manager job.,6,2,82
Jim,   [shakes Michael’s hand] Thank you. [Dwight looks disappointed and angry behind them]    				,6,2,82
Jim," Ah, ah, ah. Where’s the “please”? We’re not animals.",6,3,83
Jim, I’m sorry to hear about that. Who is this about?,6,3,83
Jim, Okay. Just want to let you know I take complaints very seriously. So… When did this happen?,6,3,83
Jim, I’m just gonna write “held back tears.”,6,3,83
Jim," If you stop crying, I’ll stop writing it.",6,3,83
Jim, Can I talk to you in my office for a second?,6,3,83
Jim, Thank you. I’ve noticed we’ve been having a lot of conference room meetings. ,6,3,83
Jim," And I’m wondEring if perhaps those are a bit, um–",6,3,83
Jim," Okay. Yesterday, we had a meeting about planets.",6,3,83
Jim, I just think that maybe they’re eating large amounts of the day.,6,3,83
Jim, How about this? I think our goal should be we don’t have meetings unless they’re absolutely essential. ,6,3,83
Jim," [walks in, see’s Oscar, Stanley, Creed and Kelly sitting in Michaels office] Okay, I thought I saw people missing.",6,3,83
Jim," Really? Hey, Stanley, what was the last thing Michael said before I came through the door?",6,3,83
Jim," Okay, Michael, I thought we agreed to not take up people’s time with meetings like these.",6,3,83
Jim," Michael, this is a conference room meeting.",6,3,83
Jim," Great. Guys, can I just have a moment alone with Michael?",6,3,83
Jim," That is not what I said, and, also, I am co-manager, meaning you are not the only manager anymore. I am also I co-manager.",6,3,83
Jim," I’m not bossing you around. I’m trying to do my job, which is sharing your job, so maybe we should just call David Wallace.",6,3,83
Jim, Which will clearly affect the day-to-day well-being of our employees. ,6,3,83
Jim," David, I know that I’m very new at this, but I have a very good perspective on how things work. ",6,3,83
Jim," Do you mean, like break-in in the middle of the night and change the numbers on payroll?",6,3,83
Jim, Okay. You know what would help is a pros and cons list for our options. ,6,3,83
Jim," I’m sorry, are you advocating that I use it less?",6,3,83
Jim," Yeah. Okay, so for the 1.5% increase, pro– everyone gets a little bit. ",6,3,83
Jim, Con– no one gets as much as they did last year.,6,3,83
Jim," I’ve been studying Michael for years, and I’ve condensed what I’ve learned into this chart– [pulls out a pie chart] How Michael spends his time. As you can see, we have procrastinating and distracting others, and this tiny sliver here is critical thinking. I made it bigger, so that you could see it.  				",6,3,83
Jim," You know, the more I think about it, the more I think we should give it to the salesmen. ",6,3,83
Jim," I know. I just think it seems smart to keep the salesmen happy right now. ‘Course I know that this might come off as biased, so you know what? Let us… ",6,3,83
Jim, I’m not gonna let you stop me from thinking. ,6,3,83
Jim, I think that you are able to take constructive criticism very well. ,6,3,83
Jim," No, it’s because you also have a lot of weaknesses, Michael!",6,3,83
Jim, I don’t think you’re good at making tough decisions!,6,3,83
Jim," At thinking out the options, and then stating that decision very clearly, especially when it’s an unpopular decision. ",6,3,83
Jim," But maybe I’m here for a reason, because I might have some good ideas, too. I’ve been sitting out there, and I’ve been learning a lot, and maybe I can just bring something different to the table. ",6,3,83
Jim, [leave the conference room to address everyone],6,3,83
Jim," Could I have everyone’s attention, please? I have some tough news, so I’m just gonna give it to you straight. Truth is, we only have so much money for raises this year, so the simple fact is some people will get raises, and some people won’t. Now, what we’ve decided is, we are gonna give those raises to the sales staff. ",6,3,83
Jim," Look, you guys are smart, so I’m just leveling with you. I’m just trying to treat you like adults. ",6,3,83
Jim," Really what it is, is about the money the sales staff brings into the office.  ",6,3,83
Jim," Okay, Dwight, you know what? You’d be getting the raise so–",6,3,83
Jim," Wow! I’m just gonna rewind and back off a bit, so… [imitates a tape rewinding and chuckles, Michael comes over by Jim laughing]",6,3,83
Jim," [sarcastically] Well, obviously. Too bad he’s a temp and doesn’t count, so let’s get started. [starts to write on a piece of paper]  ",6,3,83
Jim," [to camera] It’s going really well, actually.   ",6,3,83
Jim," [to camera, holds up a bean] Each Boston Baked Bean represents half a percent raise. We each got 24 beans, so the idea is, you place the bean on the picture [walking around the table] of who you think deserv– who’s that? [picture that Michael drew of toby, looks like a monster]",6,3,83
Jim, He’s not a part of this. You know that. ,6,3,83
Jim," Okay, you’re gonna still have to play that bean. You know that.",6,3,83
Jim," Uh, on a scale of one to ten, I’d say I’m about a four.",6,3,83
Jim," I mean, a performance-based raise sounded like a good idea, right?",6,3,83
Jim, We tried to find the fairest way to do it. ,6,3,83
Jim, [to camera] Michael’s my only friend left in the office. Except Pam… I think. Is she still upset?,6,3,83
Jim, [Michael give Jim a “World’s Best Boss” mug] Thank you.,6,3,83
Jim," Believe it or not, Kevin, fire crackers are in the don’t column.",6,4,84
Jim, No. This is a fire cracker free wedding.,6,4,84
Jim, Absolutely. ‘Cause not everyone knows and some people may be offended.,6,4,84
Jim," [aims imaginary camera at Pam] Click. Oh, you blinked. Damn it. Now that’s in my brain forever.",6,4,84
Jim," Niagara Falls used to be, like, a spiritual experience for people. They stayed in tents and it blew their minds. It’s really kitchy now, which is a lot of fun.  				",6,4,84
Jim, And Beesly. Tonight we’re in two seperate rooms and tomorrow night is the honeymoon suite.,6,4,84
Jim," Dad, remember, no mention of the baby, right?",6,4,84
Jim," Michael, I thought we discussed that we would rather you not speak, like, at all. Because it’s just going to be blood relatives, I think.",6,4,84
Jim," Alright. Hey, everyone. Thanks for coming.",6,4,84
Jim," Aw, thanks, Pete. That was really nice. I just want to say how happy we are that all of you are here tonight. And I want to especially thank those of you who traveled from far away to be here with us tonight… especially the Flordia cousins who, obviously, can’t take a hint. [laughter] Four years ago, I was just a guy who had a crush on a girl who had a boyfriend. And I had to do the hardest thing that I’ve ever had to do… which was just to wait. Uh, don’t get me wrong. I flirted with her. Pam, I can now admit in front of my friends and family that I do know how to make a photo copy. Didn’t need your help that many times. And do you remember how long it took you to teach me how to drive a stick?",6,4,84
Jim," I’ve been driving stick since high school. So… yes. For a really long time that’s all I had. I just had little moments with a girl who saw me as friend. And a lot of people told me I was crazy to wait this long for a date with a girl who I worked with, but I think even then I knew that… I was waiting for my wife. So…  I would like to propose a toast. So if you’d all raise your glasses. Not Pam, for obvious reasons, but everyone else. If you would raise your glasses–",6,4,84
Jim," Pam can’t drink? I didn’t– I shouldn’t have said that. I don’t know why I did. She can do whatever she wants, though she shouldn’t. She shouldn’t because she’s an alcoholic. Pam is an alcoholic. That’s not true. I– no. What we want– the real reason is that, that Pam’s pregnant.",6,4,84
Jim, Is there something about being a manager that makes you say stupid things?,6,4,84
Jim," Look, I would so take him in any other circumstance, but I’m pretty certain I’m completely wasted.",6,4,84
Jim,  I may have told some people that.  I’m nervous.  I’m about to get married.    				,6,4,84
Jim,  So beautiful. [Pam’s starts to cry.  Jim pulls up chair to sit next to her] Hey–,6,4,84
Jim," [takes her hand] Hey.  You look just as I imagined you would.  Pam, you’re so pretty.",6,4,84
Jim," And who cares?  It’s a stupid veil, right?",6,4,84
Jim," There.  Now we’re even.  [Pam laughs and mimes taking a picture, they kiss]",6,4,84
Jim,"  I bought those boat tickets the day I saw that You Tube video.  I knew we’d need a back-up plan.  The boat was actually Plan C.  The church was Plan B and Plan A was marrying her a long, long time ago.  Pretty much the day I met her.    				",6,4,84
Jim," How did you get this number? Michael, we’re on a catamaran. ",6,5,85
Jim, I’m gonna help you through it all right?,6,5,85
Jim, All you’re gonna need to [faking a bad connection] and-  it- and then go to–,6,5,85
Jim, I [drops out] at the Bermuda Triangle. An-  M-  please don’t call again.,6,5,85
Jim, [goofy voice] Frank and Beans. [laughs] Always makes her laugh.,6,6,86
Jim," Wow, that’s… really thoughtful of you, Dwight, thank you. ",6,6,86
Jim," Well, that’s great. Congratulations. Who’s the lucky lady?",6,6,86
Jim, Oh my God. [Michael bangs the table] Oh my God. ,6,6,86
Jim," Okay, as far as dinner tonight, cancel that, and please, for both our sakes, never, ever, ever see her again. ",6,6,86
Jim, You know what? Can I have the weekend to decide?,6,6,86
Jim," You know what, I am really slammed, trying to catch up on everything here and I know that Michael’s slammed too. So, maybe we should do this when things are a little less crazy. ",6,6,86
Jim," No, it- [high-pitched feedback as Jim starts to leave, feedback changes as he moves, turns over the mallard to see the listening devics, sighs, places mallard back on the desk]  				",6,6,86
Jim," Uh, I think we should just drop it… ’cause obviously he doesn’t want to talk about it.",6,6,86
Jim, [singsong voice] Who wants a hot chocolate?,6,6,86
Jim," [sighs] Oh, so Dwight gave me this wooden mallard as a gift, and I found a recording device in it. Yes. So, I think if I played it just right I can get Dwight to play out the plot of National Treasure.",6,6,86
Jim," [holding up a sign that reads, “Dwight picked the wrong day to put a wooden mallard in my office”]   				",6,6,86
Jim,"  I am gonna need your advice [starts playing loud opera music, everyone can hear it, Creed starts crying] I was thinking about getting this opera for Dwight’s birthday, what do you think?  ",6,6,86
Jim,  And whoever comes up with the best idea gets a $50 gift certificate to the restaurant of his or her choice.  [everyone claps and makes comments],6,6,86
Jim,  Yes!  I think we should look into that.  If you could just speak up louder… ,6,6,86
Jim,  Nothing… nothing at all… it’s all good!,6,6,86
Jim,"  Barely, I… I don’t have all the facts.  Frank and Bean… ",6,6,86
Jim,  [Pam storms out of the break room] Hey… ,6,6,86
Jim,"  [walks into his office and sees the mallard back on his desk] Dwight, you brought the mallard back.  ",6,6,86
Jim,  [speaking into the mallard and looking a Dwight] Hi buddy.  ,6,6,86
Jim,"  Okay, just to be clear, you’re terrible at this and you are not equipped for espionage… ",6,6,86
Jim,"  I won’t.  But, you will wash and buff our car.",6,6,86
Jim,"  [in the conference room] Hey Pam, can I see you for a second?  So, Dwight heard you were having a really rough day.  So he generously offered to wash our car.  ",6,6,86
Jim,"  Yes, he did.  You know what was nice, nights swimming in Bayou bay.  ",6,6,86
Jim,  [Michael is seen debating on whether to come back in to the office] Remember that older couple whose kids were also named Jim and Pam?  ,6,6,86
Jim,"  Well, we went on a Segway tour and we’re awesome at it and Frank and Beans!  ",6,6,86
Jim," We are doing a haunted house this Halloween. Which is actually kinda spooky because, as legend has it, on this very site there used to be a productive paper company.  				",6,7,87
Jim, Yes. I am the popular social networking site known as Book Face.,6,7,87
Jim," Alright. Let’s clear this up. [on phone] Well, there’s actually been a few changes in the company and Michael and I are actually at the same level. So, I can- no. Nope. Why would that be a problem?  				",6,7,87
Jim, They said that they would feel more comfortable if you came along.,6,7,87
Jim," Sure. Michael’s a good teacher. A teacher is someone who stands right next to you your whole life and never lets you do anything. That’s what a teacher is, right?  				",6,7,87
Jim, Yeah. I’ve spoken to them on the phone.,6,7,87
Jim, He’s trying to micro-co-manage me… or co-micro… manage… me.  				,6,7,87
Jim, I’ll just leave that suit in your office then.,6,7,87
Jim, Mmm… it’s like Michael said. It was some- something else.,6,7,87
Jim," Truthfully, it wasn’t the way he fell in. It was… how long it took him to get out.  				",6,7,87
Jim," Ok. Great meeting, everybody. That’s it.",6,7,87
Jim," I think you just gotta ride this one out, man.",6,7,87
Jim, Maybe if you make fun of yourself it’ll all go away.,6,7,87
Jim," Really? Do it. I am a big, stupid goofball.",6,7,87
Jim," Mm… I’m, know what? Maybe we should go easy on Michael, guys. You know, you watch that tape and you’re gonna have to stay late for more sensitity training, so… ",6,7,87
Jim," Whoa, whoa, whoa. Ok. Yeah. We’re not watchin’ this.",6,7,87
Jim, That will inevitably lead to mocking. So… ,6,7,87
Jim, Guys. Michael can’t handle this and as your boss I’m saying we’re not watching it.,6,7,87
Jim," Oscar, yes. You’re right to stop it. Thank you. Eject it.",6,7,87
Jim, Oh… man. I thinke when I started to see you go in I think I just froze.,6,7,87
Jim, It’s a killer new dance move. [re-enacts leaning back] Do you wanna talk in your office?,6,7,87
Jim, I didn’t ask you. [back to Michael] Would you like to talk? [walks away],6,7,87
Jim," I should’ve grabbed you. I’m sorry. Look, I thought I could’ve done today’s sales call alone. I mean, I may never be as good a salesman as you are, but I at least need the chance to do the job.  				",6,7,87
Jim,"  Oh man, that’s crazy.  Right as we were on our way out too.",6,8,88
Jim,  Rarely.  If ever.  Let me give it a whirl.  I’ll talk to them. ,6,8,88
Jim, It’s my pleasure. [takes phone from Pam] Hello?  Well that’s great. [hangs up phone]  Turns out the paper was there all along.  ,6,8,88
Jim," Oh, burn.  Burn on you… and a little bit on me, too. [they laugh] ",6,8,88
Jim,  And I don’t support her choice to hit you.  ,6,8,88
Jim,  But at the same time she looks crazy and I do understand her reasoning.  ,6,8,88
Jim,  I just need some time. Just give me some time to make a decision.,6,8,88
Jim, No more than a week.  Maybe two weeks.  ,6,8,88
Jim,"  OK, so there’s no defense for that, good to know.",6,9,89
Jim,"  OK, with all due respect to everyone here, I think the most worthy opponent of you is you.",6,9,89
Jim,"  So let’s just say that Dwight has come at you with the throat punch.  Now how would you, Dwight, defend against it?",6,9,89
Jim,"  And what if he comes at you with the other hand, because he does have two.",6,9,89
Jim,"  Oh my God, he’s making you look like such a fool.",6,9,89
Jim,  You two are so evenly matched I don’t know how one of you is going to get the upper hand.,6,9,89
Jim,  Are you serious? [starts typing on the computer and Andy begins to lean in toward the computer],6,9,89
Jim,"  [Michael in his office playing music loudly, Jim walks in and turns the volume down, Michael trailing off on singing]  We have to do something because people are losing it out there wondering what’s going to happen.",6,9,89
Jim,"  Listen, Wallace said these were just rumors, right? So we have no reason to think the company is anything but fine.  So if we just go on with our work, you and me, they’ll follow along.",6,9,89
Jim,"  That rhymes, so what have we on the docket today?",6,9,89
Jim,"  Alright, let’s conference room it up! [everyone is now in the conference room]  Here’s the deal guys.  There is no new information as of yet, so I suggest we all just keep working.  				",6,9,89
Jim,"  Sure I’m a little nervous, but doing our work will make us feel better.  I only slack off when things are good.  				",6,9,89
Jim," Customers have to use the coupon code from the website.  And as of now there is no differentiation between the letter O and the zero, but we are working on that. Stay tuned for that.",6,9,89
Jim,"  Hey, I am wondering if this is a, uh, terrible idea.",6,9,89
Jim,  I thought we agreed that we wouldn’t do things like this.,6,9,89
Jim," Co-managing is a give and take.  You have to pick your battles.  One of the battles that I picked was to stop Michael from running plastic tubes all over the office and placing hamsters inside of them.  He was going to call it Tube City. So, yes, I do owe him one.  				",6,9,89
Jim,  And what Designing Woman are you basing that on?,6,9,89
Jim,"  OK, so Corporate is still in their meeting.",6,9,89
Jim,"  Alright guys, it’s a work day and you guys work here, so let’s go do some work.",6,9,89
Jim,"  [Michael walks in] Oh, hey, Michael. Listen, I brought up those sales targets.  Do you want to-",6,9,89
Jim,"  No, you’re not reopening the case.  The case is closed.",6,9,89
Jim,  Or maybe he’s just stuck in character.,6,9,89
Jim,"  It’s going to be alright. We’re a good company, we’ll figure this out.  We’re not going under.",6,9,89
Jim,"  Michael, can I… OK, I’m just going to skip right past the what and go with why.",6,9,89
Jim,"  Michael, can I talk to you in your office?",6,9,89
Jim,"  Sure.  Oh, you know, while I have you… today I was working on this pitch for a supermarket chain, and it would actually be a big account and I wanted to-",6,9,89
Jim,  Well there is some bad news.  [accent] There has been another murder.,6,9,89
Jim,"  I think today was a good day to have two managers.  ‘Cause if you’re a family stuck on a lifeboat in the middle of the ocean, one parent might want to just keep rowing.  But if the other parent wants to play a game, it’s not because they’re crazy.  It’s because they’re doing it for the kids.  And I get that now.  				",6,9,89
Jim,"  Andy revealed himself to be a double agent.  At which point Dwight felt comfortable revealing that he also was double agent.  And then Michael announced to everybody that – get this- he was a double agent.  Oh, and it is 6:00.  				",6,9,89
Jim,"  [Michael, Dwight, Andy and now Pam are in the circle and training their ‘weapons’ on each other, Jim walks in]  Really?",6,9,89
Jim," Five years ago, corporate said we had to start a recycling program for Earth Day so Dwight took the lead on that and introduced us to a very close friend of his named Recyclops.  				",6,10,90
Jim, The next year he really stepped things up.  				,6,10,90
Jim, A year after that Recylcops really began to take shape.  				,6,10,90
Jim, Then tragedy struck Recyclops when his fictional planet was attacked by some other fictitious thing… I can’t remember.  				,6,10,90
Jim, I think this was also the year he renounced Earth Day and vowed to the destroy the planet he once loved.  				,6,10,90
Jim," God bless you, Recyclops. And your cold robot heart. [Dwight throws an aluminum can towards the recycling bin and misses]  				",6,10,90
Jim," Hey, Ryan. Could you start consolidating all our Rolodex information into Outlook?",6,10,90
Jim, But if the company doesn’t go under then we’ll finally have all our contacts in one program.,6,10,90
Jim, Maybe we should just wait and find out.,6,10,90
Jim," Hey, Phyllis. Are you just getting back from lunch now?",6,10,90
Jim, Ok. You shouldn’t be telling me that stuff and also shouldn’t be taking two hour lunches without telling me.,6,10,90
Jim, I care about them and I’m just as much of a boss as Michael. [Stanley laughs] What’s so funny? I’m a co-manager.,6,10,90
Jim," Well – who? How did you? Who, who told you this?",6,10,90
Jim, Ok. Who else has heard the rumor that I am not as much in charge as Michael? [everyone raises there hands – including Pam],6,10,90
Jim," I am just as much of a boss as Michael and I can do anything that Michael can do. Alright?  Who here believes that I have as much power as Michael? [Pam, after a moment,  is the only one who raises her hand]  				",6,10,90
Jim, I gotta make an example out of him. Should I just fire him?,6,10,90
Jim," To be honest, I don’t know, but maybe I could just yell at him in front of people. ",6,10,90
Jim," Well, that was apple-picking day and there’s no need to yell that day, you know. I was just excited to find the car. Perfect end to a perfect day. ",6,10,90
Jim," Simple data entry, though. So there’s really only one way to do it.",6,10,90
Jim," But, you know what? I came up with something and I think it’s really gonna help.",6,10,90
Jim," I think this is really gonna help. If you could just hold up here one second. [addresses the whole office] Hey, guys. Quick announcement. If I could just have everyone’s attention. [turns back to Ryan] I just figured you needed a place where you can concentrate and not be bothered by bothering people.",6,10,90
Jim," Let me show you what I mean. [Jim opens the closet door to reveal a work station] Your new office. How great is that, right? For a job well done. Well, not done. ",6,10,90
Jim, [laughs] You’re a good kid. You know what? It gets bigger once you’re in there. Enjoy it. [shuts the door and walks to his office],6,10,90
Jim," Wait, are you the patient or the doctor?",6,11,91
Jim," Great.  Hey, how do you feel about starting an Employee of the Month program?",6,11,91
Jim," You’re not in it at all, because you can’t be employee of the month, you’re a manager.",6,11,91
Jim," Let me guess, you think you should get it.",6,11,91
Jim," Okay, if it’s all the same to you, I’m just going to take away “Survival Skills” and “Self-defense.”",6,11,91
Jim," Okay, ladies and gentlemen, Welcome.  I know you’re all very excited, but no matter who gets this, I just want to say that you are all employees of the monthin my eyes.  And the winner is, employee number nine.  And that is?",6,11,91
Jim," Guys, listen.  This was anonymous, all right?  There is no way I could’ve given it to myself because I didn’t even know who was on here.  I just gave it to the employee with the highest overall score.",6,11,91
Jim," Will everybody stop for a second, because obviously I’m not taking any of it.  A mistake has been made and we’ll figure it out.  Second of all, there was no cash prize.",6,11,91
Jim," No, Dwight, I meant… Yes, in a perfect world, someone would get money.  But-",6,11,91
Jim," Look, there was a big mistake obviously, so I will fix it.  Okay?  This was your idea anyway.",6,11,91
Jim," Guys, this isn’t some elaborate scam, okay?",6,11,91
Jim," Okay.  That is me, but I didn’t order the cake.",6,11,91
Jim," So there was a little bit of a miscommunication here today.  It’s been a little wild, uh, but I am on it.",6,11,91
Jim," I really don’t know how it happened, David.  				",6,11,91
Jim," All right, it will not happen again.  I promise.",6,11,91
Jim," No, it’s not “ugh.” It is… office camaraderie.",6,12,92
Jim," Three, two, one! [pulls sheet to reveal Christmas tree]",6,12,92
Jim," We didn’t, because we think it’d be better to do it together.",6,12,92
Jim," Hey, Creed, we covered it. Lump of coal!",6,12,92
Jim, Yeah I told her a long time ago she could do it.,6,12,92
Jim, I’m not gonna go tell Phyllis that she can’t be Santa.,6,12,92
Jim," You can’t yell out “I need this, I need this” as you pin down an employee on your lap! ",6,12,92
Jim," Michael, it’s Phyllis. We want Phyllis as Santa.",6,12,92
Jim, Who wants Phyllis as Santa? [most everyone raises their hand],6,12,92
Jim," And if you want Michael as Santa, raise your hand. [Michael, then Dwight raises hand]  Can I get you some punch?",6,12,92
Jim,  No. [Michael gets up and walks into his office]  ,6,12,92
Jim, Not great. You heckled Santa for an hour and a half.,6,12,92
Jim," Michael, wait. So they said we are sold?",6,12,92
Jim, Okay. We haven’t gone under. We’ve been sold and that can mean many different things.,6,12,92
Jim," No, you won’t, because he’s not picking up his phone.",6,12,92
Jim," Thank you. Hey, we should be fine if we leave around 11:20.",6,14,94
Jim," Well, now we won’t get lost. Or we could drive. And that takes one minute.  				",6,14,94
Jim," Turns out, a lot of parents want the very best for their children. That’s weird.",6,14,94
Jim," But if not, there’s always the army. The infantry.",6,14,94
Jim," [Christian Slater impression] So you’ve been shown a nonsensical video. You’re probably wondering, “What’s going on?” Well, you’re not alone.   				",6,14,94
Jim," [after entering daycare] Ok, this is officially the cutest thing I’ve ever seen. Cubbies. I totally forgot about cubbies.",6,14,94
Jim," Oh. Adorable, right? [opens kiddie bathroom, sees man on toilet] I walked in on someone in the bathroom.",6,14,94
Jim, I just walked in on someone in the bathroom.,6,14,94
Jim," This is great. Got to confess, we came a little early, so we got a quick look around, but, uh –",6,14,94
Jim," No, no, no, no. Yes. We saw this, yes. No, it wasn’t like a look around. We really just had a peek. Quick peek. Didn’t focus on anything in particular. ",6,14,94
Jim, We should just go. He’s really uncomfortable.,6,14,94
Jim, What if we just bring it up? We just put it out in the open?,6,14,94
Jim," There was one thing we were curious about, uh, your flexibility on things like Easter or Memorial Day, because we might want to change our days around a little bit. ",6,14,94
Jim," Oh, no, sorry. Just, um, we’re kind of planners. But we’re also flexible too, so you know what? Maybe we can just discuss it when the time comes. ",6,14,94
Jim, Did it? It might have come up while we were waiting for you. ,6,14,94
Jim," Oh, this coming from the guy who still uses a children’s toilet? Why didn’t you just lock the door, man?",6,14,94
Jim," I’ll take over. Um, what we’re doing here:",6,15,95
Jim, I… Why would you just say something like that?,6,15,95
Jim, This is way more than I make now.  				,6,15,95
Jim," I don’t think I’m gonna miss being manager. You know how some people say they’re not in it for the money? Well, with all due respect to this job, I think I’m definitely in it for the money. And quite honestly, the women.  				",6,15,95
Jim, Exactly that. I think that you absolutely deserve the manager position more than I do.,6,15,95
Jim," No, I really, really think Michael is better at being manager for so many reasons.",6,15,95
Jim," [on phone] You gotta do something, man. You can’t just sit there.  				",6,15,95
Jim," For now, I’m just gonna go back to work here…",6,15,95
Jim," For the record, I fought this. Alright? And now, I’m not really sure what we do.",6,15,95
Jim," Hey, what was that movie where their boss was within earshot and they could’ve just gone and talked to her.",6,15,95
Jim, That’s it. I think we should do it the Lethal Weapon way.  				,6,15,95
Jim,"  Michael’s saying he’s better at being manager, and I agree, cause he’s a better people person, weirdly.",6,15,95
Jim,"  [on the phone] Hey, did I tell you we were going to have a baby?  Oh, thank you very much.  I’m excited.  Oh, definitely.",6,16,96
Jim,"  Yeah, we’re slow-playing it because of our stupid HMO.",6,16,96
Jim,"  Not to mention the extra night’s sleep in the hospital will be very nice because once we bring the baby home, if it’s crying all night, one of us is going to have to take care of it.  And I do not plan on helping unless it’s a boy.",6,16,96
Jim,"  Michael, you shouldn’t have done that.",6,16,96
Jim,"  Hmm, that logic’s air-tight, but unfortunately it wasn’t conceived here.  Burning man, port-o-potty.",6,16,96
Jim,  Because the insurance company only covers two nights.,6,16,96
Jim,  [after Pam has another contraction]  That’s seven minutes.  Here we go.  This is happening.  Come on.,6,16,96
Jim,"  Okay, but we are leaving at five minutes apart.",6,16,96
Jim,"  So, the plan was seven minutes.  But we’re calling an audible, because that’s her call.  Because she’s the quarterback.  I’m just the left tackle who happened to get her pregnant.  				",6,16,96
Jim,"  Okay, crazy.  I think I have some better things to do with my day than worry about you, like sell printers.",6,16,96
Jim,"  Well not until Friday 20% off toner cartridges, that’s a big deal.  While we’re on the subject, why don’t I just run you down to the hospital and we’ll just do a quick check?",6,16,96
Jim,"  You know, it’s getting real crowded in here.  Maybe you guys should all go back to work because the day’s not out yet.",6,16,96
Jim,"  [as Andy and Kevin shout “yeah!” in response to Michael] Okay, I feel like this noise is going to prevent Pam from being able to listen to her body’s signals.",6,16,96
Jim,"  [as Pam has another contraction]  Oh!  Oh, alright.  That’s a good one.",6,16,96
Jim,"  Okay, you know what?  I’m going to go give, uh, doctor Asmani a quick call.  He’d probably know…",6,16,96
Jim,"  Nope, nope, nope, nope.  Come on, let’s go to the hospital.  Pam, let’s go to the hospital right now.",6,16,96
Jim,"  Great.  I will do that.  Sorry, Pam, I just feel a little bit frazzled.  And you know how very rarely I use that word.  Frazzled.",6,16,96
Jim,"  Oh, and by the way, hate that you’re helping her with this right now.  Totally.",6,16,96
Jim,"  I know Pam better than anyone in this office, and obviously she’s gone crazy, but everybody wants to say that I’m crazy.  But I’m not crazy, she’s crazy.  I’m not crazy, she’s crazy.  [reading from various books]  Five to seven minutes.  Five to seven minutes.  Six minutes.  Different, but not really.  Five to seven minutes.  				",6,16,96
Jim,  [Pam approaches as he sits in his car]  Hey.,6,16,96
Jim,  Mad?  How could I be mad?  We’re having a little girl.,6,16,96
Jim,"  Wow, we’re having a little girl.  Oh, man.",6,16,96
Jim,"  Woo, alright.  Well, I definitely feel better.",6,16,96
Jim,"  Hey, come on.  Let’s go to the hospital.",6,16,96
Jim,"  Pam, Pam, it’s time.  Let’s go to the hospital.",6,16,96
Jim,"  Come on, Michael says we should go now.",6,16,96
Jim,  You know what?  Let’s go.  We got to go to the hospital.,6,16,96
Jim,"  If anyone can do this, you can do this.",6,16,96
Jim,"  The best news is, we’re going to have a baby today.",6,16,96
Jim,"  No, I told you to warn me at five minutes.",6,16,96
Jim,"  We waited too long!  Two minutes doesn’t do us any good.  Well, what happened to four and three minutes?",6,16,96
Jim,"  Alright, we’re driving ourselves, actually.",6,16,96
Jim,"  Go bag’s in the car…  Keys, my keys, where’s my keys?",6,16,96
Jim,"  Okay, I can’t find my keys!  I cannot find my keys!  Found ’em.  They’re here.",6,16,96
Jim,"  Alright, here we go!  You’re doing great!  She’ll be here soon.",6,16,96
Jim,"  Okay.  I know, I know.  But my iPod is in the go bag.  We’ll be fine.",6,16,96
Jim,"  Pam, no!  Are you nuts?  We’re going to the hospital now.",6,16,96
Jim,"  Pam’s doing great.  Uh, she’s ten inches dilated now.  Uh, sorry, meters.  Centimeters.  And she’s also fully faced.  Which I don’t know what that is, uh, but no baby yet.  It’s only been six, uh, nineteen hours, and uh, I just went out for some ice chips because I might have passed out a little bit, but these are very refreshing, very good.",6,16,96
Jim,"  [as Pam screams]  Doing great, push again.",6,16,96
Jim,"  Oh, my God!  Look at her!  baby, she’s so beautiful!  Oh, my God.",6,16,96
Jim,"  No, let’s let her rest.  I’m sure there’s still twelve on each.",6,16,96
Jim,"  She’s seven pounds, two ounces, eighteen inches.  Mother and daughter are doing great.",6,16,96
Jim,  I am a diapering master.  I have done little else in the past two months.  There is nothing I cannot diaper.  Go ahead.  Try to think of something.  I dare you.  				,6,16,96
Jim,"  It’s so weird, she was saying it just before you got here.  				",6,16,96
Jim,"  I can’t.  She’s too strong.  She’s, careful, though.  You don’t want to break it.",6,16,96
Jim,"  Well, you’re pushing the milk out, right?",6,16,96
Jim,  Wasn’t it…  It’s kinda like a…  Like that.,6,16,96
Jim,  I think you’re good.  Doing a good job.,6,16,96
Jim,"  Oh!  Really?  Must have sat on it, Pam.",6,16,96
Jim,"  Ha ha.  No, yeah, that will be good.  				",6,16,96
Jim,"  Careful…  Wow, she just shoves the nipple right in there.",6,16,96
Jim,  You see that?  I’m pretty sure she’s…  Hi.  				,6,16,96
Jim,  Yup.  Really great.  When’s she available?,6,16,96
Jim,  No need.  I saw him do it.  I can try it.,6,16,96
Jim,"  Okay, I’ll just go get the other guy.  				",6,16,96
Jim,  Okay.  Sshh.  I know.  [hands the baby to Pam],6,16,96
Jim,"  We definitely are.  At 3:00, right?  You said we could stay until 3:00?",6,16,96
Jim,"  Newsflash, the whole thing needs to go in the car.",6,16,96
Jim,"  Or it could be a half hour, if you need it to be…  Can we get a late checkout?  I don’t…  I don’t think she heard me.  				",6,16,96
Jim,  Are you really sure we should be leaving?,6,16,96
Jim,"  Right, okay.  Yes, that would be the smart thing to do.  Uh, Pam, I will be right back.",6,16,96
Jim," [swats over various photos and knickknacks, points at paperwork] Is this yours or mine?  				",6,17,97
Jim, Good Lord! [Photo of Cece on Jim’s desktop] I can’t believe I’m missing this.,6,17,97
Jim, Okay. Love you. We’ll talk soon. [hangs up phone],6,17,97
Jim, Oh it’s tough being here for a lot of reasons.,6,17,97
Jim, And I’m actually pleased to be able to offer you printer cartridges and toner now.,6,17,97
Jim, [Overlapping] When’s the last time you upgraded your printer?,6,17,97
Jim, [Turns off Dwight’s music] Whether it’s this time or next time.,6,17,97
Jim," No, we definitely can talk about it in the next–",6,17,97
Jim," [On phone in hallway] No, I know I need to work, I just- I feel weird not being home.  				",6,17,97
Jim, I am not surprised that Dwight’s using my baby to steal my desk. I’m a little surprised that it’s working.  				,6,17,97
Jim," Hey Jo, it’s Jim Halpert. I actually scheduled a meeting at 7:30 with a very important client. And it’s so weird, because we never have meetings after 5pm. But I was hoping that maybe just this once, it would be okay.",6,17,97
Jim," You know I will. And by the way, seriously, we never, never do this!",6,17,97
Jim, [pops back into Jo’s doorway] Thanks again by the way.  				,6,17,97
Jim, Yeah. We should be able to have that right over to you by Monday. Yeah no problem. [Reveal Jim behind Quad-Desk] Thank you.,6,17,97
Jim, Oh my God. We’re going to have to re-name it then aren’t we? [Dwight’s phone rings. He crawls into nook under Jim’s Quad-Desk],6,17,97
Jim," Oh my God, that’s right. I read in People magazine that he was looking for a two-bedroom condo in Scranton. ",6,18,98
Jim," I had a little better reason to believe that… You’re right. You’re right. Well, you’re not right, because Johnny Depp…",6,18,98
Jim," This is actually a big potential sale, so…",6,18,98
Jim," Alright, here we go. [taps page] Michael…",6,18,98
Jim," So I’m going to go ahead and save you some time, and tell you that no-one’s going to go along with this. But you knew that, right?",6,18,98
Jim," Alright. So why don’t you just give me my share of the leads, and I’ll start making some calls?",6,18,98
Jim," Ahh, these aren’t leads. What are they? ",6,18,98
Jim, I am currently reading incoherent riddles on blue index cards to find vital information that Michael has hidden all over the office. How are you?,6,18,98
Jim," Oh my god, I couldn’t envy you more.   				",6,18,98
Jim, Having a baby is as exhausting as they say it is. Having two babies [holds up index cards] – that’s just unfair.  				,6,18,98
Jim," How about this one – ‘When arrogant salesmen are mean to my face, a certain manager will go to his moppy place.’",6,18,98
Jim, [holds up the retrieved lead] It involves you too. ,6,18,98
Jim, Phew! Can’t wait for this day to be over.,6,18,98
Jim," Between the – us and you guys. It’s unnecessary, right?",6,18,98
Jim," Oh, good, phew,  thank god you said that.",6,18,98
Jim," She’s wearing a onesie [holds out his cell phone, Oscar leans in but Kelly grabs his arm]  				",6,18,98
Jim," Can we at least all agree that this is uncomfortable, and may be heading for something bad?",6,18,98
Jim, I’ll text Pam. She’s really good at this stuff.,6,18,98
Jim, Pam texted back saying we could give them all iPods.,6,18,98
Jim," Alright. Then we’re back to cash. And I got to say, if giving a small percentage of our commissions is going to smooth all this over, I’m for it.",6,18,98
Jim," No, we agreed, two percent for the quarter. Okay [others enter] Hey everybody!",6,18,98
Jim," No, no – this is a representation of how we feel. And how we feel is:",6,18,98
Jim, – two percent milk! What I forgot for the coffee. ,6,18,98
Jim,19. [grunts] I had a really hard work out this morning.,6,19,99
Jim,"I would love, love, love to go. Only problem is, Pam’s at home with the baby and I think she wants a night in. ",6,19,99
Jim,"Absolutely, I will do that right now.  				",6,19,99
Jim,"I gotta tell you, this baby is amazing. She gets me out of everything. And I – and I love her. I also love her, very much.  				",6,19,99
Jim,"So some of the co-workers were thinking of going out tonight, but I told them-",6,19,99
Jim,"Oh, hey, Pam and I are gonna go play pool with one of her friends, and we need a fourth.",6,19,99
Jim,"Hey, you’re supposed to hit the white ball first, buddy. Nice one. Can I talk to you for a sec? All right. Everything ok?",6,19,99
Jim,[Michael playing air guitar on pool table] Wow. Maybe we should tell her that he’s not normally like this.,6,19,99
Jim,Maybe it should come from a note… with flowers…tomorrow.,6,19,99
Jim, I literally did not know that existed until this moment. ,6,20,100
Jim," Oh, guys. I really refuse to participate. “Michael, can I have an advance on my paycheck because a Mrs. Fields Cookie just opened up at the mall.” ",6,20,100
Jim," “Sorry, Gabe, but that show hasn’t been on in many cookies.”",6,20,100
Jim, I think you need to go a little easy. You can’t just suspend someone form work.,6,20,100
Jim," And I got to take this bad attitude, and I got to go home, and I got to adjust it. And I hope the suspension does that. ",6,20,100
Jim," Yeah, I mean, the Count has a very distinct voice.",6,20,100
Jim," Buenos dias, Miguel. Como estas? Bien? Claro que si! Yo estoy fantastico. Que pasa? ",6,21,101
Jim," All right, so I’ll finish up on bulk pricing, and then you go into delivery guarantee. ",6,21,101
Jim," Yeah, or maybe we don’t even need that. ",6,21,101
Jim, Yeah I think we have complimentary strengths. We understand each other. ,6,21,101
Jim, [whispering] I don’t even know who you are anymore. ,6,21,101
Jim," [explaining PowerPoint to Donna] So, yes, laser printers are more expensive. But they cost less to operate [knocking] So it’s a tradeoff. ",6,21,101
Jim," Well, maybe you shouldn’t try to kiss people at work. ",6,21,101
Jim," Pam, you know he’s not gonna get anywhere, and he’s gonna blow our sale. ",6,21,101
Jim," Hey, the Schwab guy told us to treat every sale like it was a huge sale. ",6,21,101
Jim," Uh, for that printer, yes. Unfortunately we don’t have a lot of flexibility. ",6,21,101
Jim, What if she’s just flirting with you to get a better price?,6,21,101
Jim, ’cause I stopped by your desk like 15 times a day.,6,21,101
Jim," [chuckles] Yeah. That’s what we’re doing. In our very limited free time and with our very limited budget, we went and got a nanny and then we went out and took a class on a very outmoded and very unnecessary form of communication just so we could talk about you in front of you.   				",6,22,102
Jim, But you didn’t believe any of this was true five minutes ago. ,6,22,102
Jim," That’s interesting. Wow, it’s a little early for ice cream, don’t you think?",6,22,102
Jim," You know Michael, this whole Donna thing is gonna be okay, you just… stop beating yourself up. ",6,22,102
Jim," You should stop this, [pulls away mayo and olives bowl] and you should call Dwight right now. ",6,22,102
Jim," Wait, so are you… you like heart-shaped jewelry, though, right?",6,22,102
Jim,  So we’re gonna say the most likely scenerio is that Michael matured overnight?,6,23,103
Jim,  Then let’s just not do this. Do you have any idea the risks involved?,6,23,103
Jim,"  Yeah, well it’s really warm in here. It’s like a sleeping bag.  				",6,23,103
Jim,"  Well, you were surprisingly restrained. ",6,23,103
Jim,  [yawning] What about an energy drink or something?,6,23,103
Jim,"  Well, it doesn’t mean I can’t drink it.",6,23,103
Jim, This is a very good idea. This is good. Let’s get all the bad ideas out now. Flush them out.  				,6,24,104
Jim," Guys, I think that seems a little unfair. I mean, I feel like we don’t definitely know it was Andy.",6,24,104
Jim," I mean, it could be you, Gabe. I mean, that’s the point.",6,24,104
Jim," Hey, listen man, you can’t take it personally.",6,24,104
Jim," Hey, Dwight, I don’t know if you heard, but we’re supposed to be drinking out of weird backpacks instead of cups, like regular people.  Oh, you did hear.",7,1,106
Jim," That’s right. The janitor said that. By the way, the raccoons are back. ",7,1,106
Jim, I think they run through these panels and then down under the map. I wouldn’t know for sure cause I don’t have a trained ear. That’s why I have to use one of these. [pulls out stethoscope],7,1,106
Jim," Yep. Wait, and this. [hands Dwight a hammer]",7,1,106
Jim," What happened to me this summer? Dwight bought the building, so actually, this has been the busiest summer of my life.   				",7,1,106
Jim," Oh, no. Don’t worry about it. I was just gonna put a couple keys on it every day until Christmas. Then his pants would have fallen down, which was a little gift to me, but…",7,1,106
Jim," Well, it would have been. So unprofessional, Mrs. Halpert.",7,1,106
Jim," Oh, man, so many points being made.  				",7,1,106
Jim, But you’re comparing you and Luke to God and Jesus. ,7,1,106
Jim, You really think you can make it up to me with food?,7,1,106
Jim," Yep. That’s exactly what my first thought was. And then I remembered having a conversation with him where he was like, “I don’t own an Ebay store,” so…",7,1,106
Jim," Come on, give me your hand. I’ll help you down.",7,1,106
Jim," Oh! Of course there is. Hey, Chinese tonight?",7,1,106
Jim, Pretty good. You must be almost out of water.,7,1,106
Jim,  These are actually forks and knives from the break room.,7,2,107
Jim,"  Were going to head outside, give it a whirl. I just want to see how it works. ",7,2,107
Jim,"  But I’ll tell you this, if this works out, I think we’re looking real good. ",7,2,107
Jim,  You’re good… you’re good at sales.   				,7,2,107
Jim,"  Ok, Dwight. We can’t do that. So why don’t you just tell us what happened?",7,2,107
Jim,"  Wait, wait, wait. That’s actually a really good idea Kelly.",7,2,107
Jim,"  Dwight, how about this? Instead of boycotting, you and I, together, go down to that store and we teach those snobs a lesson.",7,2,107
Jim,"  Before me stands your coworker, Dwight Kurt Schrute. Dwight, show them all sides. Turn around. Now, today, we need your help turning Dwight into a gentleman.",7,2,107
Jim,"  No, this is instead of the boycott. Yeah?",7,2,107
Jim,"  We present to you for your comments and approval, Dwight K. Shrute.",7,2,107
Jim,  Is that what you were here for? A crystal wizard? I like it.,7,2,107
Jim,"  Wait a second. You know you can’t buy that now, right? And I can come back and get it for you later. But I’m saying right now, we can’t do that. ",7,2,107
Jim," You should actually thank Erin, she’s the one who agreed to babysit. ",7,3,108
Jim, We can relax. Let’s get our Sweeney on.   				,7,3,108
Jim," Okay, I think everybody just needs to relax.",7,3,108
Jim," [overlapping with Pam] Really, all you had to do was play with her for, like, 30 minutes and then put her to bed. ",7,3,108
Jim," Well, the car seat was to take her to the hospital, or…",7,3,108
Jim," Alright, well, we’re never leaving the house again. ",7,3,108
Jim, [attempting to move car seat] It’s like The Hurt Locker!  				,7,3,108
Jim," No, it was not a disaster. It was weird, but it wasn’t a disaster. I think we have, like, a gift bottle of Irish cream.",7,3,108
Jim, Am I blocking anybody? Can everybody see?,7,4,109
Jim, Are you sure you once knew how to do this?,7,5,110
Jim," Well, I do the best with what I’ve got. Let’s go.",7,5,110
Jim, He’s not the Steve Nash. He’s big though. He’s kind of like…Scranton’s Steve Nash.,7,5,110
Jim, I’m not doing that. I’m just explaining.,7,5,110
Jim," Well, I’m neither of those things, so…  				",7,5,110
Jim," Oh, ha ha ha. Dwight…[motions to lobby]",7,5,110
Jim," No, he didn’t. [Dwight mouthing “yes, he did”]  				",7,5,110
Jim, What? He never called you? I thought you said it just fizzled.,7,5,110
Jim," Hey, it’s Jim. Listen, this is important. Are you busy?",7,5,110
Jim," Listen, you gotta get over here, ’cause we’re pitching Steve Nash and Danny Cordray is here.",7,5,110
Jim, The big gun thing. [Dwight grabs at phone] Stop!,7,5,110
Jim, Meredith was the perfect choice to play the head of the company. Her lunch break lined up with our appointment with Danny and…that’s it. That’s really all we were looking for.  				,7,5,110
Jim," Okay, he’s not that good-looking. I don’t understand why everybody’s obsessed with this-",7,5,110
Jim, We gotta get someone else in there right now.  				,7,5,110
Jim, You’re an exec at Pennsylvania Solartech and-,7,5,110
Jim," Will you stop? Stop it, stop it. Here’s the story-they need Meredith somewhere else asap, okay?",7,5,110
Jim, So you’re taking over. You just gotta get her out of there as soon as you can.,7,5,110
Jim," And listen if anything else happens, just…roll with it.  				",7,5,110
Jim, Great. Sounds awesome. Just have him pitch to you.,7,5,110
Jim," Michael, I think you really want to talk to him.",7,5,110
Jim, I’m just kidding. She told me about it.,7,5,110
Jim," Hey, crazy, um…so…that’s it? You’re just-you’re fine?",7,5,110
Jim," Stanley just drank OJ out of my mug, and didn’t seem to realize that it wasn’t his hot coffee. So the question has to be asked, is there no limit to what he won’t notice?  				",7,6,111
Jim, Sounds like someone’s really trying to convince us that he’s not the Scranton Strangler.,7,6,111
Jim, [places pipe in mouth] I am Popeye!  				,7,6,111
Jim," I’ve never really been a costume guy. Even when I was a kid, it just felt like something I was too old for. And then this morning, when Pam hands me this little number [holds up Popeye costume, shakes head] …no.  				",7,6,111
Jim," So four years ago, when I was in Stamford, Connecticut, and dating someone else, Pam went on two dates with Danny. Which was obviously the greatest love story ever told, given how much people are walking on eggshells around us.",7,6,111
Jim, Madge from the warehouse just made her first sale. Madge. We should have been doing this a long time ago.  				,7,6,111
Jim, That is crazy. We would never care if Andy or Kevin went to your party.,7,6,111
Jim, It’s not like you guys had some long relationship right? Big painful breakup I don’t know about? ,7,6,111
Jim, Oooh! You can’t handle the truth! [laughs],7,6,111
Jim, We have one question to ask the spirit world and you want us to ask that?,7,6,111
Jim," When you work hard, you play hard around here.  Even if you don’t work hard. Oh, here’s something. Uh, why didn’t you ever call Pam back?",7,6,111
Jim," Yeah. I mean, I’m not saying that everyone has to fall in love, or anything, I’m just saying… but you know, to not even call her back is…",7,6,111
Jim, Could be. But you also called her the second time so you had the number right.,7,6,111
Jim, Hey. She had a nice time. It seems rude.,7,6,111
Jim," To be honest, I still can’t believe he didn’t call her back. Who doesn’t call a dork like that back?  				",7,6,111
Jim, [holding Cece] Spinach in a can. Power eat spinach. [Popeye sound],7,6,111
Jim," So by that rationale, if I had to sneeze, I should just sneeze on you.",7,7,112
Jim," [sneezes on Dwight, looks at camera] You’re welcome.  				",7,7,112
Jim," It is really funny, but you know that can be confusing at a christening because you are not the godfather.",7,7,112
Jim," Okay. All right, come on. [picks up Cece from Pam, whispers to her] Where are we going? Where are we going? We’re gonna take a little field trip.  				",7,7,112
Jim," [whispering, going into the bathroom with Cece] Okay. Okay. There’s my girl. All right. Hold on one second. There we go. What’s that face for? Oh, my-oh, my God. Cece, no. No, no, no, not on the dress! Cece, stop!  				",7,7,112
Jim, No. There’s no extra outfit in the bag.,7,7,112
Jim," Okay, “A,” Halbert. And, “B,” I think a more appropriate statement would be, “The ‘Halberts’ are hosting an intimate reception for their invited guests.”  				",7,7,112
Jim," Huh, you think she is jealous about having a baby?",7,7,112
Jim," Okay, well, you know what? Everybody’s hungry. [Pam looks at Jim] Sorry. I think I’m just hungry.  				",7,7,112
Jim," I think that was sconesy cider, noted baptism reception critic.",7,7,112
Jim," Oh, hey, Mee-Maw, would you watch Cece for a second? Don’t worry. She’s asleep. I’m just gonna track down some more chairs.",7,7,112
Jim," [seeing Cece gone from the couch he left her] Uh, MeeMaw, where’s Cece?",7,7,112
Jim," I don’t know. Hey, have you seen my baby?",7,7,112
Jim," Uh, everyone? Everyone, can I just have your attention? Has anyone seen a small-[pointing to Angela] Stop that tiny blonde woman! She stole my baby!",7,7,112
Jim," [to Cece] Hi. [to everyone] All right. Travel safe, Angela.",7,7,112
Jim," What’s that? Oh, yeah, back then I did. Just now. So, don’t, because I’ve got my eye on you.",7,7,112
Jim," Some events are so news worthy, so historic, that you have to stop everything to watch. Balloon Boy, Michael Jackson’s funeral. Things that if you didn’t see them live, you wouldn’t really care that you didn’t see them at all.  				",7,8,113
Jim," [changes channel during commercial, sports scores appear on screen.]",7,8,113
Jim," Oh, it was commercial break so I just wanted to check the scores.",7,8,113
Jim, Well I think enemy’s a strong word. ‘Cause I think we have a really charming back and forth. And-,7,8,113
Jim, That’s not gonna make your pizza eating experience any better. Trust me.,7,8,113
Jim," I’m going home, and I’m taking my baby with me.",7,8,113
Jim," I’m not gonna- [cuts himself off, Kevin walks in]",7,8,113
Jim," Uh, it’s saying the server went down? Does Anybody know that password? ‘Cause otherwise we can’t do any work.",7,9,114
Jim," Why don’t we just call the I.T. Guy who set it up? What’s the name of the guy in Glasses, again?",7,9,114
Jim," [on phone] All right, Thank you, I will–I will send the contracts over right away. All Right. [hangs up the phone and rubs his eyes] Whoo! [Erin jumps in the background]  ",7,9,114
Jim," I am on the first hot sale streak of my life. I think it all comes from feeding Cece, because no matter how much she resists, I sell her those carrots. Let’s be honest–if I can make mushed carrots seem better than a boob… I can pretty much sell anything. [laughs]  ",7,9,114
Jim, What are you talking about? We–we have a commission cap?,7,9,114
Jim," A commission cap takes away my incentive to sell. So you realize I now have no reason to work, right?",7,9,114
Jim," Well, since I have no incentive to sell, I’ve cleaned my car, organized my desk, and taken a multivitamin. So… what now?   ",7,9,114
Jim," Yeah, it’s not as fun if I’m not blowing off work.",7,9,114
Jim," [blows a raspberry, Erin looks shocked, Kevin chuckles]  ",7,9,114
Jim," [hovering over Meredith’s desk] Oh, nice, wasting time, here we go.",7,9,114
Jim, [listening to and editing Jo’s book on tape],7,9,114
Jim, [puts his phone in his coffee mug and calls Gabe],7,9,114
Jim," [opens door to Gabe’s office] All right, good night, Gabe. Just wanted to say thanks again. [Gabe motions that he’s on the phone] ‘Cause I really think I made good use of my day, oh! Sorry.",7,9,114
Jim," [whistling, places cup of coffee onto Dwight’s desk] Ahh, Thank you hands. Nothing else in the universe can do what you do.",7,10,115
Jim," Oh, don’t worry about it. Dwight, its okay. You were wrong.",7,10,115
Jim," Well on the plus side all this worrying about China has made you smarter than Oscar, Michael.",7,10,115
Jim," Oh God, I’ve been playing Zombie Soccer for two hours?",7,10,115
Jim," Woah, there is a lot of brainpower in this room. We’ve got Michael and Oscar, the two smartest guys in the office, also in that order.",7,10,115
Jim," Around here, Oscar is known as ‘actually’ because he will insert himself into just about any conversation to add facts, or correct grammar. He really does fit that old stereotype of the smug gay Mexican.  				",7,10,115
Jim," Woah, woah, woah. Do you know what you just agreed to?",7,10,115
Jim," He’s trying to set you up Michael. What’s going to happen is he’s going to try and bring up what ever you’re talking about in a very casual way, but secretly he’ll be trying to trip you up, and when he does, boom, its awful. Haven’t you noticed that I don’t bring up the Tour de France around him?",7,10,115
Jim, It’s still on a bike path though right?,7,10,115
Jim, And you didn’t fail those things either.,7,10,115
Jim, You gotta be kidding me. Who isn’t jumping?,7,11,116
Jim, Why’s it smell real? [Pam shows him a hidden car-freshener] Ah… good one.  				,7,11,116
Jim," [Jim goes outside, makes a snowball, and brings it back inside] Hey, Dwight. [Jim throws the snowball at Dwight and everyone laughs]",7,11,116
Jim," Well, it’s not a snowball, ’cause it’s only a dusting. Right?",7,11,116
Jim," We still doing the gifts today? [Pam nods] I mean, it is the Christmas party. Well, the classy Christmas party.",7,11,116
Jim," [A note is on Jim’s computer that says, “It is time. Parking lot at noon.” Jim nods and hands it to Dwight who burns it.]  				",7,11,116
Jim," [standing outside, dials Dwight’s cell phone]",7,11,116
Jim," Um, I was laying on the ground, defenseless, and uh, he just kept throwing ’em until he exhausted himself. And, uh, [cell phone chimes] then… [reading text message] “How ’bout icing it? lol. Dwight.”   				",7,11,116
Jim," Don’t. Stop, Dwight! [Dwight pelts Jim with snowballs] Dwight, stop! Dwight, stop!",7,11,116
Jim, Okay. Okay. [Dwight throws another snowball and laughs maniacally]  				,7,11,116
Jim," I can’t reconnect with you right now. Hold on one second. [he hurls a snowball at Dwight with a lacrosse stick, misses, and shatters a window, everyone gasps] Excuse me. [clears throat]  				",7,11,116
Jim, What are you talking about? You’re the one terrorizing me.,7,11,116
Jim," Okay, I’m sorry, why are we discounting this whole “Woody came to life” thing so quickly?",7,11,116
Jim," [walks over to his desk and sees a present sitting on it, reading the note] “Hey, Pickles, Merry Christmas. Open immediately. Love, Swiss Cheese.” [opens the present and a snowball shoots out at him, everyone laughs] Damn it, Dwight!",7,11,116
Jim," Well, uh… I don’t think any of us really know. Alright. [Jim hands Pam a present]",7,11,116
Jim," Yup, I do make great Christmas gifts. But I couldn’t make that.  				",7,11,116
Jim," Right. Of course. [reading the comic book] “The Adventures of Jimmy Halpert.” Oh, my God. This is awesome! That’s my bike. That’s my desk. And that is my daughter.  				",7,11,116
Jim, Have you ever seen ’em do that? [walk outside and the parking lot is covered with snowmen],7,11,116
Jim," I’m actually just looking for my Blackberry, so, carry on.",7,12,117
Jim," I’m just looking for my phone, so… pretend I’m not here.",7,12,117
Jim," [answers phone] Hey! Yeah. No, I got it. Just leaving now.   				",7,12,117
Jim," Listen, this isn’t a favor, all right?  This is a good idea. We all win. ",7,13,118
Jim," Wow. [sees guy at Erin’s desk] Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Hey, Andy, I’m really, really sorry to do this to you, but I have a meeting today that I totally forgot, so I can’t be apart of this seminar. ",7,13,118
Jim, Will you let me know when this whole seminar thing’s over? ,7,13,118
Jim," I just have a meeting, uh, outside the office. ",7,13,118
Jim, [on phone] I just want to make a point to that last caller. I disagree. I don’t think it is the running game at all. I think we do have to make a few moves in this off-season.  ,7,13,118
Jim, Psst. You think this thing’s gonna go much longer? ,7,13,118
Jim," Tom Witochkin. One of my best buddies, actually. ",7,13,118
Jim," I was blue group, so it was second from the top. ",7,13,118
Jim, “My mom thinks you’re too dumb to hang out with.”  ,7,13,118
Jim," Yeah, woah. [deeper voice] Yep, absolutely, go ahead. ",7,13,118
Jim, He’s going to be a lot of fun to drive around in a car with. ,7,14,119
Jim, That’s it? That’s all I get? Even after all the hard work I put into celebrating your talent today?,7,14,119
Jim," Well, those things that you consider doodles, I consider art. ",7,14,119
Jim," Ok fine, three hints. One! When you are getting colder, you’re really getting warmer. ",7,14,119
Jim," Two! You have a better chance, if you think Bob Vance. ",7,14,119
Jim," You know what, just think about it, you’ll be fine. ",7,14,119
Jim, Alright. Well we’ll be there in ten minutes. ,7,14,119
Jim," Alright, Well if I see a gas station, I’ll pull over. ",7,14,119
Jim," Just stay there. I’ll be there in one second. Michael! Michael! Excuse me, sir there is a guy in the bathroom. He’s coming out but I have to go because it’s an emergency. Will you just tell him call the office. Just call the office! Thank you. Please? ",7,14,119
Jim," Hey it’s me. So uh, don’t worry. Everything’s ok. ",7,14,119
Jim, Nothing. Absolutely nothing. You’re not holding a cup of coffee or anything are you?,7,14,119
Jim," Uh, so, Cece had a little bit of a fever. And your mom also locked her in the car. ",7,14,119
Jim," No no no it’s ok. So, Cece is with daddy now. She’s laughing and she’s happy. And we are on our way to see Dr. Barbra. ",7,14,119
Jim," Yes, and your mom got a very well deserved day off. So here’s the thing though. I left Michael at the gas station on Benet. ",7,14,119
Jim, And his wallet and phone are on the seat next to me. ,7,14,119
Jim, [getting out of a taxi] There you go. Thanks. ,7,15,120
Jim, We decided to have a Valentine’s day lunch and then that way we can spend the entire night with Cece and avoid the Valentine’s day dinner thing. It’s a whole thing. ,7,15,120
Jim," [on phone] All right, I will fax over it to you. Whoop. I will fax it over to you. Okay. Thank you. [chuckles]",7,15,120
Jim, [goes to hand Dwight a valentines card] Wait. ,7,15,120
Jim," Well, we were just looking for Ryan, so he’s not here. ",7,15,120
Jim," No, because the office isn’t what I’d consider a romantic place. ",7,15,120
Jim," Yeah, if Michael Scott did your home movie!",7,16,121
Jim, I did not love the dialogue. Or the character.  I took the role to impress a receptionist who will remain nameless.  ,7,16,121
Jim," [cracking up at the stupidity of it, the rest of the office besides Michael and Holly are concealing their laughter. Pam Is trying to quiet Jim up] Sorry.",7,16,121
Jim," I’m sorry, I’m really, really sorry. I think I was just relieved, to see that Michael Scarn got his confidence back.",7,16,121
Jim," [he office shushes Michael to hear the movie better] That’s fine, it’s great!",7,16,121
Jim," Because of the sign, that says no pounding no begging.",7,17,122
Jim, [Pam kisses Jim on the cheek] Eleven months.,7,17,122
Jim, Okay now really think hard about this one:,7,17,122
Jim," [time has obviously passed, as everyone is gone except Jim and Dwight] Four hundred and ninety-four months?",7,17,122
Jim, Four hundred and ninety-FIVE months. That’s just…  				,7,17,122
Jim," [Pam walks over to him and smiles excitedly while bouncing, Jim imitates her] Can I do something for ya?",7,17,122
Jim," Nice. You know, I cleaned our daughter for like, an hour at four a.m. this morning, so…",7,17,122
Jim," Whoa, pull it back. Uhm, why did you hire Todd Packer? ",7,17,122
Jim, [Pam starts nodding in agreement] Why are you nodding?,7,17,122
Jim, [interrupts Dwight trying to force feed Todd] Can I talk to you a second?  				,7,17,122
Jim," Well, you know you can’t actually poison him. ",7,17,122
Jim, I really think we should join forces on this one.  ,7,17,122
Jim," What do we think, what would drive him crazy.",7,17,122
Jim," You’ve gotta stop with the hot chocolate stuff. I was thinking we can jam his drawers, so they only comes out two inches, then he can see everything in them but he can’t get to them.",7,17,122
Jim," Okay! Well this isn’t my best, but call Froggy101, say that we’re the tour manager for Justin Bieber, and we’re giving away free tickets, we give him a number to call for the tickets, and it’s his own number.",7,17,122
Jim, One thirty-five. Did you like one thirty-five?,7,17,122
Jim," [using fake Southern accent, on the phone with Todd Packer, Dwight is also with Jim] Absolutely, now when you get down there, Jo’s a little bit, uh, forgetful. So she may have locked the gate, but what you’re gonna do is go ahead, hop it, and just head back to the pool. [Michael walks in on Jim and Dwight]",7,17,122
Jim," It is weird! Look at you, perceptive. Now I know why Jo’s kept her eye on you!",7,17,122
Jim, [trying to stop him] Whatever you wanna do in your spare time is up to you!,7,17,122
Jim," [trying to hide from Michael what they’re doing, he picks up the phone and talks directly into it] All right, so just pack your bags and, uh, be sure to bring those swimming trunks! Bye now! [hangs up]",7,17,122
Jim, Wait! Why don’t we come up with a plan we’re all happy about? [Michael leaves]  				,7,17,122
Jim," I was in Jamaica, and I got lost, and it was getting dark this one night and then out of nowhere with a cart and he’s selling these. Dwight he’s telling me things about myself that there’s no way he could have known.",7,18,123
Jim," Probably, probably. So I buy some, I turn the corner, I feel like an idiot, so I go back to get my money, he was gone.",7,18,123
Jim, Correction. I do not want to sell you Professor Copperfield’s Miracle Legumes.,7,18,123
Jim, [pulls away beans] I’m really sorry. Pam must have put those out.,7,18,123
Jim," They’re legumes Dwight, and you’re just gonna make fun of me, so why would I… You know what, this ends now. [crumples up beans, stomps on them, and throws them in a box]  				",7,18,123
Jim, Oh it was when she was working in New York so it was halfway between both of us.,7,18,123
Jim, Cause it’s a big deal. I mean.. I knew Pam was gonna say yes but I was still scared.,7,18,123
Jim, [points to picture of Cecelia] We made that.,7,19,124
Jim," Yeah, they don’t ever talk about careers that were made because of unplanned pregnancies.   				",7,19,124
Jim," Alright, wait, little bit of backstory, she loves dogs. She calls them ‘da-das’.",7,19,124
Jim, We were… I think she was just trying to-,7,19,124
Jim," Wait, so, you don’t go into shock or die or anything?",7,19,124
Jim," Listen, you’re the one who decided to leave. Come on, he’s the new boss, you know we have to do this.",7,19,124
Jim," Why don’t you just, privately, in your own head, think of it like a meeting.",7,20,125
Jim," [Jim and Pam are walking outside] I just don’t understand the desire to push sweet potato fries on me, and not just regular fries.",7,20,125
Jim, Get in the car? [Jim and Pam get in the back seat],7,20,125
Jim, I think you got this. Kay? [Erin nods] Alright. Feel better!,7,20,125
Jim," I’m sorry, that just wasn’t interesting to me.  				",7,20,125
Jim," Wow! I do not parent for the award but I gotta tell you It feels pretty good. Uh, Cece, if you’re watching this at home it’s way past your bedtime, by the way how’d this get televised?",7,20,125
Jim," I don’t know maybe being a good dad is just all in your own compass. I don’t know, I don’t know. Thank you!",7,20,125
Jim," I don’t know that we need to dissect it all now, but-",7,20,125
Jim, So you guys are filming people when they go to the bathroom now?  				,7,21,126
Jim," [to Michael] Hey! It’s almost your last day, come sit with us.",7,21,126
Jim," [Michael walks into the office, still a mess] Ahh, what happened to you?",7,21,126
Jim," Uhh, she’s still pricing the whatevers. The shredders.",7,21,126
Jim," [brings Michael into his office] So I’ve been meaning to tell ya, I wanna take you out for lunch. For your last day.",7,21,126
Jim," What do you think? Tomorrow? Lunch, you and me?",7,21,126
Jim, You’re not leaving tomorrow. You’re leaving today right?,7,21,126
Jim," Wow, so that’s it huh? Just, four o’clock and you are gone for good.",7,21,126
Jim, Absolutely not. It’s just that sometimes… goodbyes are a bitch.,7,21,126
Jim, You know what I think we should do? I think we should just save the goodbyes for tomorrow. At lunch.,7,21,126
Jim," And then tomorrow, I can tell you… what a great boss, you turned out to be. The best boss I ever had. [Jim is holding back tears too]",7,21,126
Jim," Listen Michael, I really… I did text Pam, but…",7,21,126
Jim," [shakes Michael’s hand] I will see you, tomorrow at lunch.",7,21,126
Jim, No he doesn’t.  You just get so nervous and hyper around him.,7,22,127
Jim," Every time there’s a silence, your brain’s like “Heh-heh-huh-huh” [imitating crying].",7,22,127
Jim, Careful.  There is no inner circle.  				,7,22,127
Jim," There is no inner circle.  Deangelo just prefers to delegate a few things, to a few guys.  				",7,22,127
Jim," [looking at resume] Uh oh, this former administrative assistant misspelled “administrative” and “assistant.”",7,22,127
Jim, What could he possibly stand to gain from a fake juggling routine?,7,22,127
Jim, He’s good at his job.  And I like working for him.,7,22,127
Jim," And say what?  “Hey Deangelo, are you shy or just a sexist?”",7,22,127
Jim," Umm, really, it’s nothing, I was just talking to Angela, and she was —",7,22,127
Jim," If it’s alright, can I just have like one minute alone, just to go over —",7,22,127
Jim," I know. [Gabe and Darryl stand on either side of Jim with paper and pens in hand]  Just the guys.  Well, maybe that’s, uh, part of the problem.  I think…so what happened was, I was talking with some of the department heads.  Uh, some of the female department heads.",7,22,127
Jim," Maybe there’s a vibe out there, with certain members of the office, that you are…a little sexist, or —",7,22,127
Jim, He didn’t text me.  [Andy’s phone chimes],7,22,127
Jim," [to Jordan] Don’t worry, the first day’s always the hardest.",7,22,127
Jim, Nope.  Just… [Deangelo continues staring at him] Okay. [gets up and leaves office]  				,7,22,127
Jim, So this is my life.  Until I win the lottery [laughs].  Or Pam finally writes that series of young adult books.  				,7,22,127
Jim," You know what?  Instead of a game, why don’t we do an exhibition?  I’d love to see that dunk of yours.",7,22,127
Jim," Today.  Now, maybe.  ‘Cause we have a hoop downstairs and a real ball, so you don’t have to mime it.",7,22,127
Jim," 15 feet from the baseline, so, you need me to move it in?",7,22,127
Jim, [ambulance pulls away in parking lot] Now what?  				,7,22,127
Jim," Oh my God, are you alright?  Erin, will you call 911 please?",7,22,127
Jim," All in favor of the baskets full of chocolates, teddy bears, and balloons? [all but Dwight raise their hands]",7,23,128
Jim," So as it turns out, unless you’re a young child or a prison inmate, you don’t need anyone supervising you. People just come in and do their work on their schedule. Imagine that – people like us allowed to sell paper. Unsupervised. [Darryl, Phyllis, Stanley, and Oscar are working while Andy and Ryan play on a foosball table] And yet, somehow it works. It must be because the stakes are so high.   				",7,23,128
Jim," [on phone] Well, I really appreciate the offer, but I’m just happy the way things are. Okay. Thank you. [to Pam] That was Jo, asking me if I wanted to take over as acting manager while they find a replacement. I told her… I don’t want to mess this up, right? There’s a consensus, people are happy.",7,23,128
Jim," Dwight has been acting manager for three months now. No. A week. Just feels like three months. Let’s see, we all have to punch in to a time clock, which is very old, very strong, and has a slot about the size of a finger. [Jim puts a pencil into the time clock and pulls it out broken in half] We were all given new business cards big enough to set us apart from the competition, which is how I learned that our titles are all now Junior Employee. Our lunch breaks are staggered to prevent wasting time. Mine’s at 10:30, and I find that the first hour of the day goes by a lot quicker than the second seven hours.",7,23,128
Jim," Question, if we already fomented insurrection, may we be grandfathered in?",7,23,128
Jim," Oh, it’s just a social club. You know, like the French Revolution, or the Black Panthers, or communism. It’s just a club. Guys talking, you know. ",7,23,128
Jim," Nope. Social club. God, I hate when everybody calls us a rebellion. [Darryl enters and brandishes his fist, Jim returns the gesture]",7,23,128
Jim," And we would love to have you. But not today. Unfortunately, it’s a bad day, what with Operation Overthrow and everything, but I have noted it.  [Dwight tears the sign down, Jim hangs two signs in its place]  				",7,23,128
Jim," Wow, you’ve really embraced the whole Bond villain aesthetic. ",7,23,128
Jim," I promise…d other people that I would be on my worst behavior. And I gave them my word, so…",7,23,128
Jim, You can’t fire me. You’re acting manager. Not office manager. So you have no firing powers. ,7,23,128
Jim," [quietly] If you get promoted, and if you haven’t fallen in love with me by then.",7,23,128
Jim," If I had thought that there was a real chance that Dwight would be permanent manager, I would have pre-quit. And you might be saying to yourself, “Well that’s pretty premature to think,” but I always say, it’s better to be pre-pre-preprepared.   				",7,23,128
Jim," Oh, is it my turn? Ooh, I’m on the spot. I don’t know. Um… you know what? I think I’m good.",7,23,128
Jim," Nope. When Jo’s here, can you work in “Shagadelic, baby,” at least three times in a conversation? Oh, and when I cough can you do jazz hands?",7,23,128
Jim, [quickly shakes his hands back and forth],7,23,128
Jim," Well, I don’t know about that. Just wasn’t for me. But let me assure you, Dwight is firing on all cylinders. Right?",7,23,128
Jim," Well, you do know that Jo was right to take the job away from you, right? There’s no debating that. But, I will say… in your one week, every single one of the orders went out on time. And I think that is shagadelic, baby. [Dwight sees Creed claiming the desk in the manager’s office]  				",7,23,128
Jim,  [conducting interview] Your paper experience is very interesting. Do you think you could use that experience to inform decisions here?,7,24,129
Jim,  [waiting for Fred to continue] …What is it?,7,24,129
Jim,  You could just be saying it to get the job.,7,24,129
Jim,"  How about this. Why don’t you give us a part of the plan, and that way we know you have it.",7,24,129
Jim,"  We are the Search Committee, hand-picked by our CEO, and tasked to find this branch’s new manager. Not everyone we meet will be good, but someone’s bound to be, right? [Andy, Kelly, and Darryl are each dressed up in suits for their interviews, Andy is also wearing an “Andy for Manager?” pin on his jacket] And, to be honest, I think a lot of the decent candidates are right here in-house, so, I’m not too worried. But I’m really excited to spend a lot of time with Toby and Gabe. [quietly] Did you know that Gabe’s last name was Lewis? I had no idea.  				",7,24,129
Jim,"  Unfortunately, that range is set at corporate.",7,24,129
Jim,  Heh. We think that 25 cents a mile is pretty generous.,7,24,129
Jim,"  Can you… [seems intimidated, clears throat] You are a man of great confidence. Could you speak a little more to that, and, what the role of confidence… would be… in a dialogue with a subordinate?",7,24,129
Jim,"  [Robert leaves the conference room and looks at the others in the office as he grins at the camera and leaves] He creeps me out. [Toby nods] But, I think he might be a genius.  				",7,24,129
Jim,"  [Jim and Gabe laugh, Toby smiles and nods] Oh.",7,24,129
Jim,"  Well, for instance, how did you deal with it when two warehouse guys got into a fight?",7,24,129
Jim,"  [ignoring Darryl’s question] So I think all we need is a resume, and we’ll be good right?",7,24,129
Jim,"  Yeah, it’s no big deal, just something that looks like that. [shows Darryl a resume] Cool? [goes to put the resume away]",7,24,129
Jim,  Can I ask why you’re leaving your current job?,7,24,129
Jim,"  So, Andy, what improvements would you make as office manager?",7,24,129
Jim,"  You’re not getting an interview, Dwight. The whole point of this Search Committee process is to prevent hiring someone like you ever again.",7,24,129
Jim,  [pulls Dwight’s arm down] Okay. That’s vivid.,7,24,129
Jim,"  Well, you know how I like taking bribes. [both smile]",7,24,129
Jim,"  Unfortunately, Jo also took the job away from you because she doesn’t trust your judgment. So how would that look for me, if I recommended you?",7,24,129
Jim,  He’s an amazing man. He’s a Rhodes Scholar. He invented an app that invents apps. Fantastic kisser…,7,24,129
Jim,  Darryl! We all know you. Your interview is not nearly as important as the other guys. [Darryl taps a couple times on Jim’s desk and walks away]  				,7,24,129
Jim,"  That’s very interesting. Um, I feel like there might be a conflict there, and if a conflict did arise, how would that be dealt with?",7,24,129
Jim,  I think that’s probably all we need to hear from…,7,24,129
Jim,  You know what? They all just sort of blend together after a while.,7,24,129
Jim,"  No, not at all. In fact, I’m not even taking it seriously. I think at the end of the day, I’m just gonna pick a name out of the hat.",7,24,129
Jim,"  Okay, everybody, I was just making a joke. I am taking it seriously, I promise.",7,24,129
Jim,"  [seeing Dwight wearing sunglasses and whose face and hands are completely covered in gauze] Oh, I know this guy. [Dwight awkwardly hands copies of his resume to the Search Committee] Hello! Mr. “Soo-ven-yay.” Mr. “Jacques Soo-ven-yay.” Nice to meet you. It says here you’re French. [Dwight nods] So you worked at your last job for 15 years as Assistant to the Regional Manager.",7,24,129
Jim,"  Oh, that’s my mistake, sorry about that. The last paper company you worked for burned to the ground? And all because they wouldn’t hire a manager who lived and breathed paper? That’s a travesty.",7,24,129
Jim,"  [looks extremely confused] No. No! Wait, but, I mean, you’re Dwight, and then… he’s the… [trails off]",7,24,129
Jim,"  This guy was good. Although, he did keep saying that he needed two weeks off right at the beginning for a trip to the finger lakes. Seriously. Every five minutes, he was like, “just making sure the finger lakes thing is clear.”",7,24,129
Jim,  Finger Lakes guy is good. Darryl is also very good.,7,24,129
Jim,"  You know, she also gave me a reason to think that maybe she wasn’t a good fit.",7,24,129
Jim,"  Thank you, Mr. Schnoot. [closes his binder] We will let you know.",7,24,129
Jim,  I just did. The answer to that one question told me everything I need to know.,7,24,129
Jim,"  [ignoring Dwight] All right, guys, good day, a lot of candidates. Let’s discuss.",7,24,129
Jim,"  Okay. [walks out of conference room] Okay, guys, just so you all know, no decision has been made, and Dwight is definitely not the boss.",7,24,129
Jim,"  No, no, no. Not ever, ’cause that’s not gonna happen.",7,24,129
Jim,  Am I the only one who remembers what he did when he was in charge? I feel like I’m going a little bit crazy.,7,24,129
Jim,"  Okay, seems like everybody has an opinion. So, who else? Anybody?",7,24,129
Jim,  Perfect. There are several outside candidates that we think would be really-,7,24,129
Jim,"  What about Darryl? We can all agree that he’s a stand-up guy, right?",7,24,129
Jim,  I don’t know. This conversation really got away from me.,7,24,129
Jim,"  No, they can’t. That’s not how this is gonna work. [exhales] We’re going in this room, we’re going to have a meeting. We’re gonna make a recommendation to Jo, and she’s gonna give you her recommendation on Monday. Okay? [to Kelly and Toby, as they re-enter the conference room] What the hell happened out there? [Kevin tries to follow, but the door is closed on him]  				",7,24,129
Pam, You put in the garbage can that was a special filing cabinet.,1,1,1
Pam, Are you going to Angela’s cat party on Sunday?,1,1,1
Pam," I don’t think it would be the worst thing if they let me go because then I might… I don’t think it’s many little girls’ dream to be a receptionist. I like to do illustrations. Um… Mostly watercolor. A few oil pencil. Um, Jim thinks they’re good.",1,1,1
Pam, You just still have these messages from yesterday.,1,1,1
Pam, I was in the meeting with Jan and she did say that it could be this branch that gets the axe.,1,1,1
Pam," Jim said mixed berries? Well, yeah, he’s on to me. Um… [Laughs]  					",1,1,1
Pam, Roy’s my fiance. We’ve been engaged about three years. We were supposed to get married in September but I think we’re gonna get married in the spring.  					,1,1,1
Pam, Do you mind if I go out for a drink with these guys?,1,1,1
Pam, OK. I’m gonna be a few minutes. So it’s only twenty past five. I still have to do my faxes.,1,1,1
Pam, Stealing? What am I supposed to have stolen?,1,1,1
Pam," Post-it Notes? What are those worth, 50 cents?",1,1,1
Pam, I can’t believe this. I mean I have never even stolen as much as a paperclip and you’re firing me.,1,1,1
Pam, Good. I thought you were going out for a drink with…,1,1,1
Pam, I’m saving that ’cause I like it when the cards go T-ts-ts-tch-tch-tch.,1,2,2
Pam," OK. If I have to do this, based on stereotypes that are totally untrue, that I do not agree with, you would maybe not be  a very good driver.",1,2,2
Pam," Oh, do you want me to repeat the messages that I gave you before for the… [nods toward camera]  				",1,3,3
Pam," Actually, people are really unhappy. Um, Dwight sent around this memo and people are freaking out ’cause the… ",1,3,3
Pam, OK. Dwight. Are you really in charge of picking the health care plan?,1,3,3
Pam, This is a ridiculously awful plan. Because you cut everything.,1,3,3
Pam, Why would you want to raise your cholesterol?,1,3,3
Pam, Dwight’s health care memo. I told you about it.,1,3,3
Pam," So, let’s say my teeth turn to liquid and then, they drip down the back of my throat. What would you call that?",1,3,3
Pam," Oh great. Um, no, this weekend? Nothing. I’m not really doing anything.",1,3,3
Pam, Why did you put Dwight in charge of that? He did a horrible job.,1,3,3
Pam," Um… Actually, we don’t have any staff birthdays coming up.",1,4,4
Pam, This was tough. I suggested we flip a coin. But Angela said she doesn’t like to gamble. Of course by saying that she was gambling that I wouldn’t smack her.  				,1,4,4
Pam," [whispering] Hey, Jim, can I talk to you for a second?",1,4,4
Pam," Um, I don’t know, I’m just like, I’m going a little crazy ’cause I keep overhearing all these conversations between Michael and corporate about like, staff issues?",1,4,4
Pam," Yeah, he’s making me take notes on these meetings and I’m, like, “These people are my friends.” But he’s all like, “This is confidential. You can’t tell anybody.” But I just feel like I want to… aaah. Just promise me you’re not gonna say anything.",1,4,4
Pam," [on her cell phone] Hey where are you? Yeah, we were supposed to meet here. What? Oh my gosh! That ties in perfectly with something that Michael was telling me earlier! I just don’t know what some of the people in, like, accounting are going to do? It said specifically that…",1,4,4
Pam, Happy Birthday. [gives Meredith her card],1,4,4
Pam," My fiance has plans for us this Saturday.  So I really hope that Dwight doesn’t make me work. Maybe I should sleep with him? I’m kidding, kidding. Totally kidding.  				",1,5,5
Pam," [on the phone] No, no, I know that the warranty’s expired, but isn’t it supposed to last longer than two years if it isn’t defective? OK, fine, three years.  				",1,5,5
Pam," I don’t think so Michael. Besides, I can’t cheer against my fiance.",1,5,5
Pam," [laughing] I’m just saying, Roy is very competitive.",1,5,5
Pam, And he wants to take the WaveRunners to the lake this Saturday so… ,1,5,5
Pam," Um, I think I’m gonna be up at the lake.",1,5,5
Pam," Yeah, he’s, uh, pretty good, huh? [to Roy] Let’s get you into a tub.",1,5,5
Pam, There’s a person here who wants to sell handbags. ,1,6,6
Pam, There’s an HR meeting in there at 11:30. ,1,6,6
Pam," That’s a very rude thing to say, Kevin. ",1,6,6
Pam," It’s nice having Katy around. It’s another person for Michael to um, interact with.   				",1,6,6
Pam," [mimicing Katy] Oh definitely, definitely step in and out of it like that.",1,6,6
Pam, Jim is a great guy. He’s like a brother to me.  We’re like best friends in the office and I really hope he finds someone.   				,1,6,6
Pam," No, I’m kidding. Um, so you got big plans this weekend? ",1,6,6
Pam," I, I was gonna say, I think that um, we’re gonna help Roy’s cousin move.",1,6,6
Pam," You know what they say about a car wreck, where it’s so awful you can’t look away? The Dundies are like a car wreck that you want to look away, but you have to stare at it because your boss is making you.  					",2,1,8
Pam," Oh, yeah, this is the part where Kevin sat in front of the camcorder all night. It’s great.",2,1,8
Pam, …Dwight is banning us from our bathroom.,2,1,8
Pam, …because that’s what happens every time!,2,1,8
Pam," [Breaks Roy’s grip] No, I don’t want to go, I don’t want to.",2,1,8
Pam," If you would have asked me that, then you would know.  					",2,1,8
Pam, [to an off camera waiter and still clutching Jim’s beer] Can I get a drink?  					,2,1,8
Pam," No, no. ‘Cause the ice melts and then it’s like second drink! [laughs]",2,1,8
Pam, Yay Kevin. Whoo hoo for Kevin! For stinking up the bathroom.,2,1,8
Pam," Here here! Speech, speech, speech, speech [other people start joining in]",2,1,8
Pam, I have so many people to thank for this award. ,2,1,8
Pam," Okay, first off, my Keds. Because I couldn’t have done it without them. [people clap] Thank you. Let’s give Michael a round of applause for MC-ing tonight because [people start clapping again] this is a lot harder than it looks. And also because of Dwight too.",2,1,8
Pam," Um, so, finally, I want to thank God. Because God gave me this Dundie.",2,1,8
Pam," And, I feel God in this Chili’s tonight. WHOOOOOOOO!!!!",2,1,8
Pam," I just want to say, that this was the best, Dundies, ever! WHOOOOOOOOO!!!",2,1,8
Pam, I feel bad about what I wrote on the bathroom wall.,2,1,8
Pam, My Mom is coming in to visit. And she lives like two hours away. And she doesn’t have a cell phone… which is cool cause it’s kind of adding some suspense to my day. And I keep looking over at the door hoping she’ll walk in.  				,2,2,9
Pam, I’ve decided to show her around. She really wants to meet everybody.,2,2,9
Pam," Um… I just wanted to say that… Just, my Mom’s coming in today.",2,2,9
Pam, Usually the day we talk about sexual harassment is the day that everyone harasses me as a joke.  				,2,2,9
Pam, She’s coming in today and maybe just don’t joke around about that stuff in front of her.,2,2,9
Pam," I don’t have any DUI’s so I can drive myself, but thanks.",2,2,9
Pam, I love my Mom. Okay. That’s probably really the most obvious statement ever.  				,2,2,9
Pam, Yeah. I’m in charge of this whole area.,2,2,9
Pam, This is where I used to keep my computer.,2,2,9
Pam," Yeah, yeah, but I uh… I switched stuff around because I actually needed like more room for organization. So… ",2,2,9
Pam," So this is like, um, an organization station… ",2,2,9
Pam," Well, you know… actually, I kind of need to stall a bit. But, it’s okay, because I am very used to killing time.",2,2,9
Pam," Every so often, Jim dies of boredom. I think today it was the expense reports that did him in. And our deal is that, it’s up to me to revive him.   					",2,3,10
Pam," Sometimes when he’s not here, I try to throw stuff in it. ",2,3,10
Pam, Try paperclips. Oh wait. This message. For Dwight.,2,3,10
Pam,"  Yeah, I changed them to your new address.",2,3,10
Pam,"  Yes, I changed your Cracked magazine subscription.",2,3,10
Pam," Now the bronze are really blue, and they’re also the back side of the gold, so no flipping. K? Honor system.   					",2,3,10
Pam," In English, box of paper snowshoe racing. ",2,3,10
Pam," The thing about Jim, is when he’s excited about something, like the Office Olympics, he gets really into it and he does a really great job. But the problem with Jim is that he works here, so that hardly ever happens.   					",2,3,10
Pam, I made something for our closing ceremonies. ,2,3,10
Pam, [sees Angela making check mark on tally sheet],2,3,10
Pam," Katy and Jim met in the office. And now I guess they’re like going out, or dating, or something. And, uh… I don’t know! You know? They’re just… She calls him, and they… You know, I’m sorry. I feel like I’m talking really loud. Am I talking really loud?   				",2,4,11
Pam, [to Jim] Hey! You can just give her your extension. ,2,4,11
Pam," Um, Fargo, um, Edward Scissorhands, Dazed and Confused… ",2,4,11
Pam, Breakfast Club. Um… The Princess Bride and… ,2,4,11
Pam," You know, I bet Ryan thinks to himself ‘I wish I were a volunteer sheriff on the weekends’. ",2,4,11
Pam," I forgot what a super, nice girl Katy is. And just… good for Jim! They are so cute together. And, um, what an adorable car.   				",2,4,11
Pam, [notices Michael’s costume] Papier-mache?,2,5,12
Pam, Why did you put it off until Halloween?,2,5,12
Pam, I think it’s gonna put a damper on the party a little.,2,5,12
Pam," Oh no, don’t, don’t, don’t, don’t. [Michael laughs] Aah! [laughs, then leaves] Okay… ",2,5,12
Pam, I’m guessing Angela’s the one in the neighborhood who gives the trick-or-treaters some toothbrushes. Pennies. Walnuts.  				,2,5,12
Pam," [on phone] Dunder-Mifflin. This is Pam. [listens] Uh, yeah. [snaps her fingers in the air, getting Jim’s attention] Just one second. I will, uh, transfer you to our manager, Michael Scott.  				",2,5,12
Pam," Jim is really talented. And he should be the one who’s getting a better job offer. Like, for real.  				",2,5,12
Pam,"  Don’t take this the wrong way, but… you should go for that job.",2,5,12
Pam," Yeah, but I mean, look at the salary. And it’s definitely a step up. And a challenge.",2,5,12
Pam, Oh. That was like crazy. ‘Cause I was… ,2,5,12
Pam," Oh, hey, Jim. Wait, stop. Um, I’m sorry… for pushing you towards Cumberland. Seriously, if you left here, I would blow my brains out.",2,5,12
Pam, I don’t really have any control over that Stanley.  					,2,6,13
Pam," Michael tends to procrastinate a bit whenever he has to do work. Umm, time cards, he has to sign these every Friday. Purchase orders have to be approved at the end of every month. And expense reports, all he has to do is initial these at the end of every quarter. But once a year, it all falls on the same Friday and that’s today. I call it the Perfect Storm.  					",2,6,13
Pam," Umm, I put stickers so you know where to sign. ",2,6,13
Pam," Well, the last pick-up for overnight deliveries is at seven. So you need to have them signed by then. Or much earlier.",2,6,13
Pam, [Reading Jim’s palm] You’re major and minor lines cross at a ridge – that sucks.,2,6,13
Pam, Could you practice on the forms?  					,2,6,13
Pam," No, it’s not that. Um, I was just wondering, since I’m probably going to have to stay late, could you ask Dwight to stay late too so he can walk me to my car?",2,6,13
Pam, He’s a purple belt. That’s really high.,2,6,13
Pam," Hey, put me down. Put me down. [Meredith turns and looks at Jim and Pam] Oh my god, hey, put me down. Hey…   					",2,6,13
Pam, The shipping place closes in a half hour. ,2,6,13
Pam," Michael and his jeans.  He gets in them, and I’m not exactly sure what happens.  But I can tell you, he loves the way he looks in those jeans.  I know that’s why he started casual Fridays.  ",2,7,14
Pam, [to Ryan] I’ll take those. Thanks. [throws jeans under her desk]  ,2,7,14
Pam," Oh my God, I win!  Ok, it was a minor league hockey game. He brought his brother, and when I went to the bathroom, the game ended and they forgot about me.  ",2,7,14
Pam," [to Michael on speakerphone] Ok, you want me to read ’em?",2,7,14
Pam," Ok. Um, a fisherman is walking down Fifth Avenue walking an animal behind him-",2,7,14
Pam, Ok.  There’s a transcript between a naval ship-,2,7,14
Pam, Sure.  There’s a transcript between a naval ship and a lighthouse.  ,2,7,14
Pam," Here’s what we think happened.  Michael’s sidekick, who all through the movie is this complete idiot who’s causing the downfall of the United States, was originally named Dwight.  But then Michael changed it to Samuel L. Chang using a search and replace, but that doesn’t work on misspelled words, leaving behind one Dwigt.  And Dwight figured it out.  Oops.  ",2,7,14
Pam, Yes… nice!  I can’t remember the last time someone made me dinner.  ,2,7,14
Pam, What are you going to do with your time off?,2,7,14
Pam, [points to Jim’s iPod] You have new music?,2,7,14
Pam," Oh, I don’t know… [Jim laughs, phone rings] Oh my God.  This is Jan’s cell.",2,7,14
Pam," It’s performance review day, company-wide.  Last year, my performance review started with Michael asking me what my hopes and dreams were, and it ended with him telling me he could bench-press 190 pounds.  So, I don’t really know what to expect.  				",2,8,15
Pam," Uh, just off the top… I think she’ll be here this afternoon.  				",2,8,15
Pam, Well I don’t think you’re gonna be very happy with this.,2,8,15
Pam," Because she’s conflicted.  She has to be professional, but she’s fighting feelings… for you.",2,8,15
Pam," Um, just cause, that, you work together, and it might be awkward.",2,8,15
Pam," Oh, yeah. Uh, I think I remember that from back from when I first started.",2,8,15
Pam," Oh my God, did you see “The Apprentice” last night?",2,8,15
Pam," Michael, it’s time for the suggestion box meeting.",2,8,15
Pam, You told me to buzz you about the suggestion box meeting when Jan was here.,2,8,15
Pam, Everyone’s waiting in the conference room.,2,8,15
Pam," No, I mean doing that with Michael. How do you come back from that?",2,8,15
Pam, [Jim bows to Pam; she bows back] Thank you.  				,2,8,15
Pam, [whispers to Jim] Hey.  Something just happened.  Dwight just told Angela that she has to deleted all of her sensitive e-mails immediately.,2,9,16
Pam, It’s like squishing a spider under a book.  It’s gonna be really gross but I have to look and make sure that it’s really dead.  Sooo… [to camera guys] If you guys see anything… ?  				,2,9,16
Pam," Hey, Dwight, um, my friend is kinda into these two girls that he works with.  ",2,9,16
Pam," One is tall and brunette, and the other one is short, and blonde, and perky, and kinda judgmental.  Who do you think he should choose?",2,9,16
Pam," Listen, are you bringing anyone to Jim’s party tonight?",2,9,16
Pam," No. I mean, I don’t know, I don’t think so.",2,9,16
Pam, The professors would go to the parties?,2,9,16
Pam, [to cameraman] What? [looks at Dwight eating a Baby Ruth] Ohhhh… Yes!  Thank you!  				,2,9,16
Pam, Maybe we can get him to hide and wait somewhere.,2,9,16
Pam, Down.  You have to sit down so I can get the full effect.,2,9,16
Pam," Ok, wait, so that would make me [walks to side of room] like right here.",2,9,16
Pam, Have you heard anything about any secret office romances?,2,9,16
Pam," Yeah, it turns out I was, um, just grasping at straws.  				",2,9,16
Pam," Just because two people are hanging out, it doesn’t mean that they’re together,  you know?  Like people can just be friends.  And I think that it was really unfair to think that there was anything else going on.  				",2,9,16
Pam, You do realize that we can’t serve liquor at the party.,2,10,17
Pam," [opens up her present] Oh, my god! Thank you very much, Santa, whoever you are. It’s awesome.",2,10,17
Pam, Maybe because you hated her present so much.,2,10,17
Pam, I know. It’s totally going to change the way I work out.,2,10,17
Pam, So what are you going to get me instead?,2,10,17
Pam," [laughs] No, I was just checking out my present. [holds up teapot]",2,10,17
Pam," I traded with Dwight. Just, I figured, you know, you went to a lot of trouble and it means a lot. And also, Roy got me an iPod or was going to get me an iPod, so .. ",2,10,17
Pam, [opens teapot] Oh my god! The yearbook picture!  				,2,10,17
Pam," Yeah, I think I made the right choice.  				",2,10,17
Pam," Oh, my God! It’s incredible. [Jim reaches and steals his card back before she can notice it] Is this the Boggle timer?",2,10,17
Pam," Sorry. What do I want? What do I want… Oh, it’s a pencil cup.",2,11,18
Pam," Um, I don’t think so, I just bought it.",2,11,18
Pam," Last week, Michael sent out this mysterious memo.",2,11,18
Pam, I think you’re thinking of The Hunt for Red October.,2,11,18
Pam," Hey, why don’t we find like a quieter place to hang out?",2,11,18
Pam," I mean, I don’t know. So… what’s it like dating a cheerleader?",2,11,18
Pam," Uh, I’ve been engaged for three years, and there’s no end in sight. So… you don’t wanna ask my advice.  				",2,11,18
Pam," No, no, I want my mom and dad to be there.",2,11,18
Pam," Michael, do you need me to call an ambulance?!",2,12,19
Pam," Wait a second, I thought you said that you were hurt.",2,12,19
Pam," Uh, I have to stay here and answer the phone. ",2,12,19
Pam," Michael, is, um, sick and he wants one of us to rescue him.",2,12,19
Pam," Michael, why don’t you call your girlfriend?",2,12,19
Pam, What was that?! [everyone runs to Michael’s office window],2,12,19
Pam," You missed two big conference calls today, one with corporate.",2,12,19
Pam," No, I didn’t mention that you cooked your foot.",2,12,19
Pam," It’s just that before, you said that you didn’t want any special treatment.",2,12,19
Pam," Do you want some aspirin, because you seem a little fussy.",2,12,19
Pam, Roy gave it to me for Christmas.  I’m trying to figure out how to put songs on it.,2,12,19
Pam," Oh God no, Dwight isn’t my friend… Oh my God!  Dwight’s kind of my friend!  				",2,12,19
Pam," No, he’s actually been really nice and helpful.",2,12,19
Pam," Yes, I know, but it’s gonna be different.",2,12,19
Pam," Oh my God, what is going on, is Dwight ok?",2,12,19
Pam, I can’t believe he’s getting a CAT scan.,2,12,19
Pam," Ok, that’s uh, good news [Pam sees Angela eavesdropping] Uh, yeah, no I’ll let you go.",2,12,19
Pam," I just wanted to let you that Dwight’s gonna be ok.  The doctor said there’s a really simple treatment for a concussion, so he’ll probably even be back at work tomorrow.",2,12,19
Pam," I just, uh, thought you’d want to know that.  				",2,12,19
Pam," Ok. I was thinking about wearing it down. Kind of like, I don’t know, like loose with big curls and…",2,13,20
Pam," Sick, like lots of sniffling. I don’t know.",2,13,20
Pam, Umm. How many different ways are there to sniffle?,2,13,20
Pam, Did you find anything good in your desk?,2,13,20
Pam," No, I know, like, I kind of like, I thought that maybe you did when I first started.",2,13,20
Pam," No, I mean, just ’cause we like got along so well.",2,13,20
Pam, So are you going to be like totally awkward around me now?,2,13,20
Pam," Hey, here’s your schedule for next week. Are you okay?",2,13,20
Pam," No, really, it’s okay. I know that Jim had, like a crush on me when he first started. But that was a long time ago, so.",2,13,20
Pam, Jim had a crush on me on the booze cruise or he told you about it on the booze cruise?,2,13,20
Pam," Roy and I just got back from the Poconos.  I get ten vacation days a year, and I try to hold off taking them for as long as possible, and this year I got to the third week in January.   					",2,14,21
Pam, [looking at pile on Michel’s carpet] Oh… I don’t know.,2,14,21
Pam, You’re gonna throw my things on the ground?,2,14,21
Pam, [to Roy in Jim’s earshot] …back so soon.,2,14,21
Pam," Yeah, that’s right.  We could do a three-day weekend.  I wonder if I could, like, call in sick on the Friday.  Then I get a four-day weekend.   					",2,14,21
Pam, [to Roy as Jim escapes into bathroom] Are you kidding? ,2,14,21
Pam, Somebody did something bad to Michael’s carpet. Maybe that’s all we need to know.   					,2,14,21
Pam," [voicemail message for Jim] Hey, Jim.  It’s Pam.  I keep looking up to say something to you and then Michael’s there and it’s horrible.  Anyway, I’m bored.  Come back!  					",2,14,21
Pam," [voicemail message for Jim] Hey, guess what?  I moved my computer so I can’t see Michael’s head.  It’s working.  I think I can have a career as a very specific type of decorator.   					",2,14,21
Pam," [voicemail message for Jim]  Sudoku. Level moderate. 18 minutes. Suck on that, Halpert.   					",2,14,21
Pam," [voicemail message for Jim] I’ll transfer you.  Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.  Hold, please.  Dunder Mifflin, this is … okay, sorry.  Michael was standing at my desk, and I needed to be busy or who knows what would’ve happened, so thank you.   					",2,14,21
Pam," [voicemail message for Jim] Hey, what’s that word we made up when you have a thing stuck in your shoe?  Anyway, I have a thing stuck in my shoe.    					",2,14,21
Pam," [voicemail message for Jim] Hey, I have a chance to sneak out of here early, and I’m not messing this up, so I’ll see you tomorrow.   					",2,14,21
Pam," [voicemail message for Jim] Calling from my cell phone.  I don’t know if you guys figured out who did that to Michael’s carpet yet, but I have a theory that involves an inter-departmental conspiracy.  Everybody in the office.  We need to talk.   					",2,14,21
Pam, I don’t know how I fit in with these women. Here. Or with Jan. Um… I mean we get along great. Fine. Um… I guess the person I have the most in common with is…   				,2,15,22
Pam," Well… I always dreamed of a house with a terrace upstairs. Plant flowers on it… stuff like that. Since I was a girl. Um… More seriously though, a husband that I love… Roy. And I love to draw. And I… I did a little in college and I’d still love to do something where I could work with art or graphic design in some way.",2,15,22
Pam," Well… I have a job right now, so I can’t really take time off… ",2,15,22
Pam," Well… it’s just that the weekends aren’t good because, um…",2,15,22
Pam, Good. We watched a video about our changing bodies.,2,15,22
Pam," Um… but hey? Something kind of cool. There’s this internship in graphic design that Jan was telling us about. She made it sound, like, really great.",2,15,22
Pam, Dreams are just that. They’re dreams. They help get you through the day. Like the thing about the terrace. It’s nice but… um… I don’t know. It was just something I read in this book when I was twelve. The girl in the book has a terrace outside of her bedroom and she planted flowers on it and I just loved that. Just always kind of stuck with me.  				,2,15,22
Pam, Just like no big reason. Just a bunch of little reasons.,2,15,22
Pam, Roy’s right. There’s no guarantee it’s going to lead to anything anyway.,2,15,22
Pam, What? You have something you want to say?,2,15,22
Pam," Oh, excuse me! I’m fine with my choices!",2,15,22
Pam," It’s impractical. I’m not going to try to get a house like that. Um… they don’t even make houses like that in Scranton. So, I’m never going to… .  				",2,15,22
Pam," Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam. Uh… hold, please.  				",2,15,22
Pam," Roy and I are saving for the wedding, so I made him promise not to get me anything too big.  				",2,16,23
Pam," You can’t fire me, Dwight, just ’cause Michael’s not here.",2,16,23
Pam, You need to get something for your girlfriend.,2,16,23
Pam," Ok, well, sometimes the gift is really about the gesture, you know, like what it means, instead of what it is. ",2,16,23
Pam," No, not like a ham. It’s about doing something, so that the person knows that you really care about her. ",2,16,23
Pam, [delivering plant to Oscar’s desk] Oscar.,2,16,23
Pam," Nothing, it’s just I had to sit here all day, while Phyllis got like an entire garden delivered to her. ",2,16,23
Pam," I mean, I know that we said no big gifts, but I was kind of hoping you’d get me ",2,16,23
Pam," Are you going to cry, Jim? Do you need a tissue?",2,17,24
Pam, Oh! I… uh… yeah. Um… I’ll uh show them to you later.,2,17,24
Pam, I have a ton of stuff to do for the wedding. And I have to do it in the office. And that can be kind of awkward. Um… just because people can get all weird about wedding stuff. Then… I just… I don’t want to offend… Angela… or someone.  					,2,17,24
Pam," Mom, I’m sorry. I know you and Dad are chipping in for the wedding but I do not want orange invitations. Yes! Well, if you really want my… ",2,17,24
Pam, Do we know anyone who was in the accident? ,2,17,24
Pam," Yeah, the bride doesn’t really do… Have you ever been to a wedding?",2,17,24
Pam, Roy has a connection. It’s nicer than you think.,2,17,24
Pam, Of course. He’s one of my closest friends.  					,2,17,24
Pam, Maybe we’ll use a DJ. That’s the one thing Roy’s in charge of for this wedding but all he’s managed to do is set a date.,2,17,24
Pam," Ryan, you should be more sensitive. It’s obvious she likes you and comments like that, they just… ",2,17,24
Pam, Australia? I have always wanted to go there?,2,17,24
Pam," Oh, I have more. [Holds up bags of candy]",2,18,25
Pam," Oh, Michael. You can’t be nasty today. [whispering] ‘Cause of the… [points to ‘Welcome Daughters!’ sign] ",2,18,25
Pam, Don’t you think you should say something?,2,18,25
Pam," Michael, I think that as the boss you should really—",2,18,25
Pam," Hey, Abby! Do you want to help me shred some old documents? It’s actually pretty cool. ",2,18,25
Pam, I only have one goal today. To make one kid like me. Just one.  					,2,18,25
Pam, He’s not coming out. He won’t pick up the phone.,2,18,25
Pam," So, Melissa… I met your mom a couple times. She’s ",2,18,25
Pam," It’s not too bad. I get to shred things sometimes, do you want to see?",2,18,25
Pam, Okay. Um… here it is. Don’t put your fingers in there. [shreds paper] Cool huh?,2,18,25
Pam," Yeah, I get to do this like, every week.",2,18,25
Pam, I think he thought his ukulele skills would transfer. [Jim leaves] ,2,18,25
Pam," My theory is that… [Jim signals he’s leaving, waves bye to Pam]",2,18,25
Pam," If I knew I had a week to live, I would… probably go to Europe. And South America. And the Grand Canyon. And… I would want to see the Pacific Ocean. …It would be a pretty busy week.  					",2,19,26
Pam, …I feel like we should go get Kevin something. Do you think we can sneak out of here?,2,19,26
Pam, [checking watch] We should probably head back.,2,19,26
Pam," [over loudspeaker, imitating Darth Vader] Luke, this is your father. Come set the table for dinner. ",2,19,26
Pam," [loudspeaker] Jim Halpert? Price check on fabric softener, the kind that gives you…",2,19,26
Pam, Michael’s birthday was actually pretty cool. It was a good day. I don’t know… It was a good day.	  					,2,19,26
Pam," [laughs] Jim does the best impressions. Sometimes he’ll look up at me from his desk and he’ll just be someone else. Like he’ll go um, [makes mournful face, giggles] that’s supposed to be Phyllis.  I can’t do it as good as he can.   				",2,20,27
Pam," No, no, no, no talking. Jim is not allowed to talk until after he buys me a coke.  Those are the rules of jinx, and they are unflinchingly rigid.  [Jim puts money in drink machine, selection is sold out]",2,20,27
Pam, Sold out? That has never happened in the history of jinx. ,2,20,27
Pam," Oh, okay.  Well, Michael wants to see everyone in the conference room. [Jim shakes his head. Seems relieved to be getting away from Kelly] But you know what? We have a few minutes so you guys should definitely finish up your conversation. [Jim nods his head as if to say, “Gee, thanks, Pam.”] ",2,20,27
Pam, I know that Jim has an amazing story about a relative of his who got caught up in the world of drugs. ,2,20,27
Pam, Wow! He really pulled out the big guns. Fake crying. Did not expect that.   				,2,20,27
Pam," What? [Jim shakes his head] Did you want to tell me something? You look like you want to tell me something. [Jim shakes his head no] You look like you have something really important to say and you just can’t for some reason. [Jim smiles] Come on, you can tell me. Jim, you can tell me anything. [Jim stops smiling and looks down. Pam wonders what that means]  				",2,20,27
Pam, [placing a coke can in front of Jim] Here. [Jim looks confused] Just buy it from me. I haven’t talked to you in hours and it’s been weird and I really want to know what the hell’s going on with Dwight. [Pam scoots the coke can towards Jim.  Jim pulls out his wallet and hands Pam a dollar.  He gives the coke back to Pam] ,2,20,27
Pam," There are a few people I decided not to invite, and that might make things kind of awkward but …  it’s my wedding. And I don’t want anyone there who has called me a hussy.  					",2,21,28
Pam," How about, Angela can keep it up on Tuesdays and Thursdays?",2,21,28
Pam," Hey, Angela.[hands her a Save The Date card] I didn’t have your zip code.",2,21,28
Pam, [notices Angela’s intense concern] Um… let’s move on. I volunteer. Did anyone have a problem with me?,2,21,28
Pam, I have this kind of big secret about Angela. And I’ve been really nice to her… and I haven’t told anyone. And what the hell?!   					,2,21,28
Pam," [gets up and walks over to Angela, whispering to her] Hey. Thanks for ratting me out!",2,21,28
Pam, I find that hard to believe… considering you have problems with every single person in this entire office except Bobblehead Joe.  					,2,21,28
Pam," I can’t believe Angela. I went against my better judgment, and I gave her a Save The Date. And now it turns out she complained about me to Toby.",2,21,28
Pam, I don’t know. I try not to bother him about this kind of stuff.,2,21,28
Pam," Angela, I want to talk to you about something.",2,21,28
Pam, [looks at to Jim] I am. [looks at Angela] It’s about the Save The Date.,2,21,28
Pam," Come on, it’ll be fun, and besides, I’m a roulette expert.",2,22,29
Pam," Roy was supposed to pick the band, but he’s concentrating more on the bachelor party now.",2,22,29
Pam, I’m pretty happy these days. I’m getting married soon and I’m getting along with everybody at work.   				,2,22,29
Pam, I think I should hire them all. Do like Lollapalooza.,2,22,29
Pam, Jim is great. Being with him just takes away all the stress of planning my wedding.  				,2,22,29
Pam," [phone rings] Michael, Carol Stills for you.",2,22,29
Pam, Sometimes I don’t put Michael through until he’s already said something. I look at it as a practice run for him. He usually does better on the second attempt.  				,2,22,29
Pam," It’s still me. Uh, Jan, here’s Michael.",2,22,29
Pam," [People playing casino games as the actual Casino Night begins] Oh, my God!",2,22,29
Pam," Good, especially after I took all your money in poker.",2,22,29
Pam, About when you want to give me more of your money?,2,22,29
Pam, Did you wanna do that now? We can go inside. I’m feeling kind of good tonight.,2,22,29
Pam, What are you doing? What do you expect me to say to that?,2,22,29
Pam, I can’t. I’m really sorry if you misinterpreted things. It’s probably my fault.,2,22,29
Pam," [On phone] About 10 minutes ago. No, I didn’t know what to say.  Yes, I know.  Um, I don’t know, mom, he’s my best friend.  Yeah, he’s great.  Yeah, I think I am. [Jim enters] I have to go. I will. Listen, Jim… [They kiss]  				",2,22,29
Pam, No… [Jim leans in for another kiss] Jim—,3,1,31
Pam," Yeah, I didn’t go through with the wedding.  I got cold feet, a few days before.  And I can’t really explain it.  I just had to get out of that relationship.  We still had to pay for all the food.  So we froze it.  But I’m, I’m doing well.  I have my own apartment.  I’m taking art classes.  And I have lunch for the next five weeks.  					",3,1,31
Pam," Michael, Dwight’s looking at gay pornography on his computer.",3,1,31
Pam, Maybe you should wait before you adopt.,3,2,32
Pam," Roy’s sister looked into it, and the application alone costs a thousand dollars.",3,2,32
Pam," You know, she also said the waiting list is like eight months.",3,2,32
Pam," Yes, I have a date. He’s a cartoonist for the local paper, which is really neat, because I like to draw too. I’m kind of nervous. I haven’t been on a first date in nine years… probably shouldn’t broadcast that.  ",3,2,32
Pam," [answering phone] Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam. He’s not in the office. Can I take a message? I will. You too. [hangs up] Sorry. What’s up?",3,2,32
Pam," Okay. Well, if you think of it, I’ll be here.",3,2,32
Pam, So how do you come up with your cartoons?,3,2,32
Pam," Well, it was, uh, it was really nice meeting you, Alan.",3,2,32
Pam," I went on a date. It wasn’t a love connection, um… I think when I like someone again, I’ll just kinda know.  ",3,2,32
Pam, [walking in with a tray of six popcorn bags] Popcorn anyone?,3,3,33
Pam, [with five popcorn bags left] Anyone else?  Nooo.  ,3,3,33
Pam," Movie Monday started with training videos, but we went through those pretty fast.  Then we watched a medical video.  Since then, it’s been half hour installments of various movies, with the exception of an episode of Entourage, which Michael made us watch six times.  ",3,3,33
Pam," [on the phone] Hey Kelly, my stuff just got here. [Kelly screams with excitement into the phone and Pam has to take it away from her ear]  ",3,3,33
Pam," Kelly really likes to online shop.  Soooo, I felt like I wanted some new clothes.  I mean, I just, I wanted to, it just, I felt like it was time, to maybe um… just get new clothes.  ",3,3,33
Pam, [pulling her new shirt out of a box] Ok.,3,3,33
Pam," I have this little vacuum cleaner that’s broken.  If Dwight doesn’t work out, maybe that could be manager.    ",3,3,33
Pam,"  Well, I remember why I dress the way I do at work.  But I’m gonna keep the clothes.  I mean, it’ll be cool to just have some after work clothes that aren’t pajamas.  ",3,3,33
Pam," Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. … Uh, sure, I’ll get him for you. [to Michael] It’s Jan for you.",3,3,33
Pam," I may have a few weeks ago faked a call from Jan in order to get out of a synopsis of, I think it was, Navy: NCIS. Since then, Michael’s been suspicious.  ",3,3,33
Pam," Hey Michael, would you get me some coffee from the warehouse?",3,4,34
Pam, But the warehouse coffee tastes SO much better. ,3,4,34
Pam, [after Michael returns with coffee] With cream and sugar?,3,4,34
Pam, The news that you just announced?  That Ed died?,3,4,34
Pam," I think so.  I don’t know, I was mainly focused on the cup holders.",3,4,34
Pam," Let’s see.  I had an aunt that I was really close to.  She was this amazing female boxer.  Um, anyway, she was injured in a fight, and she was paralyzed.  So, you can imagine how upset I was when I found out that she asked her manager to remove her breathing tube so she could die.  ",3,4,34
Pam, I have it covered. [hands Dwight a decorated box],3,4,34
Pam, If you wanna do something for the funeral…  ,3,4,34
Pam, Maybe you could play a song on your recorder.  ,3,4,34
Pam, Did I wake up this morning thinking I’d be throwing together a bird funeral?  You never can tell what your day here is  gonna turn into.  				,3,4,34
Pam, I’d also like to say a few words if that’s okay.,3,4,34
Pam," What do we know about this bird?  You might think, “Not much.  It’s just a bird.”  But we do know some things.  We know it was a local bird.  Maybe it’s that same bird that surprised Oscar that one morning with a special present from above.",3,4,34
Pam," And we know how he died.  Flying into the glass doors.  But you know what?  I don’t think he was being stupid.  I think he just really, really wanted to come inside our building to spread his cheer and lift our spirits with a song.",3,4,34
Pam," An impression, then.  Lastly, we can’t help but notice that he was by himself when he died, but of course, we all know that doesn’t mean he was alone.  Because I’m sure that there were lots of other birds out there who cared for him very much.  He will not be forgotten. ",3,4,34
Pam, [singing] Just smile for me and let the day begin.  You are the sunshine that lights my heart within… on the wings of love …   				,3,4,34
Pam," It’s weird. Jan use to treat Michael like he was a ten year old, but lately it’s like he’s five.   ",3,5,35
Pam, Once a year they bring in a little cart and they give away free pretzels. It’s really not a big deal. To some people it is.   ,3,5,35
Pam, Great! I thought you could use this time to authorize some checks.,3,5,35
Pam," Hey, why don’t you just go up to your office, get some work done, and I’ll just bring you a pretzel.",3,5,35
Pam," You know, I just think it’s really important that you be productive today. ",3,5,35
Pam," Did you have a lot of sugar today, Michael?",3,5,35
Pam," Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Oh, hi Jan. He’s, uh, on a sales call. No message? Bye, Jan.   ",3,5,35
Pam, These came for you. Contracts? Brent Koselli?,3,5,35
Pam, I had to work late. Jan’s making me keep a log of everything Michael does all day. ,3,5,35
Pam," Uh, no, I um. Everything’s pretty much the same here.",3,5,35
Pam, A little different. What time is it there?,3,5,35
Pam," So ok. I’m watching the movie, by myself…",3,5,35
Pam, Because I just wanted a relaxing evening at home…,3,5,35
Pam, But I’m holding on because I keep waiting for Sandra Bullock to show up.,3,5,35
Pam, Because I got it at Blockbuster and they don’t put the pictures on the box. ,3,5,35
Pam," Oh, yeah, in my fancy new apartment. I have one bedroom, one bathroom, and a closet. ",3,5,35
Pam," [Ryan and Dwight enter] Hey, Ryan, are you ok?",3,5,35
Pam, I actually might not go. Feeling kind of tired. ,3,6,36
Pam," Oh, I don’t know. I haven’t decided yet.  					",3,6,36
Pam, Maybe. I just …I don’t really have anyone to go with.,3,6,36
Pam," I decided to come. Uh… I feel a little under-dressed… but at least I’m not dressed like a slutty cheerleader, right? Is that mean?  					",3,6,36
Pam, Can you believe my boss proposed to his girlfriend in public? That is so Michael.,3,6,36
Pam," Yeah. Hey, would you excuse me for a second?  					",3,6,36
Pam, I kind of thought something would happen tonight too.,3,6,36
Pam, You say one more word; I’m stopping the car.,3,6,36
Pam, You just said that we’re gonna be gone…?,3,7,37
Pam," It’s a blessing in disguise. Actually, not even in disguise. Sometimes at home, I answer the phone, “Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam.” So, maybe that’ll stop now.  				",3,7,37
Pam, He’s not here. I don’t know where he is.,3,7,37
Pam, Is it because of Michael? Did he actually do something?,3,7,37
Pam," Sure, uh, Jan… um, do you know, is anyone coming back to Scranton?",3,7,37
Pam, Coming to Scranton. Is anyone coming to Scranton?,3,7,37
Pam, I guess some new people might be coming from Stamford. Should be fun. New blood.,3,7,37
Pam," That’s, um… I hadn’t thought about it, huh.",3,7,37
Pam," Yeah, that might be weird. Overall though, we still all have our jobs… so, good news, right?",3,7,37
Pam," Maybe this is good. Finding another job is a pain. There’s another annoying boss, another desk, I’d have to learn everything all over again. So, there are reasons to stay.  				",3,7,37
Pam," Am I being mean to Dwight? I don’t know. I did just make him run around the building and I have no intention of timing him. This isn’t even a stopwatch. It’s a digital thermometer. He does make my life harder, sometimes. And on purpose. Like he tried to put meters on the bathroom stalls as a way of bringing in more money for the company. [yells to Dwight] Hey, three more laps to go. Gotta pick it up if you’re going to beat Toby.",3,8,38
Pam," Yes! I’m in a good mood today! I’m excited to meet all the new people and to see my old friend again, definitely. That’s always a thing that makes people happy… to have an old friend back.  ",3,8,38
Pam, So when do I get to hear everything? Are you still getting unpacked or… you want to grab a coffee or something after work?,3,8,38
Pam," The day’s going fine. It’s been a little chaotic but it’s fine. It’s great! A lot of distractions. But, it’s good.  ",3,8,38
Pam, Uh… no. I just uh had some other stuff I had to do.,3,8,38
Pam, Oh. That’s totally cool. You can do whatever you want.,3,8,38
Pam, We’re friends. We’ll always be friends. ,3,8,38
Pam," …Oh, sorry. He’s–he’s dressed all in pink.",3,9,39
Pam, Kinda sounds like… prison’s… better than Dunder-Mifflin. ,3,9,39
Pam, Prison Mike? What was the food like in prison?,3,9,39
Pam," Wow. Thank you. Um, that must have been hard for you to relive that. Both of you.",3,9,39
Pam," [hands over bag] I didn’t, it’s from corporate. ",3,10,40
Pam," Psst. Jim. [Jim turns around. Pam nods head towards her for him to come over] Um, hey. I need to give you your Christmas gift now because, well, I’ll just tell you. ",3,10,40
Pam, For the past few months I’ve been sending Dwight letters from the CIA. [hands a folder to Jim],3,10,40
Pam," They’re considering him for a top secret mission. There’s his application. Oh, and this is where I made him list every secret he promised he’d never ever tell.",3,10,40
Pam, So… here’s the gift. You get to decide what his top secret mission is. [Jim smiles] Sorry I didn’t wrap it. ,3,10,40
Pam," No, I get it, of course. OK. [holds out hand for folder. Jim gives Pam back the folder.]  					",3,10,40
Pam," OK, well, why are you laying like that? ",3,10,40
Pam," I feel like I’ve been kinda cold to Karen and there’s no real reason for it. I mean it’s not like she’s ever done anything to me. So, I think I probably shouldn’t be cold to her.   					",3,10,40
Pam," Hey, Karen. Sorry about that meeting today, that was really crazy.",3,10,40
Pam, I think one of her cats did once. She came in with scratches all over her face. [both laugh],3,10,40
Pam," Right, and if you’re interested in the way more fun party, all the info can be found here on our more brightly colored flyer. [Angela rips down brightly colored flyer and walks away. Karen rips down Angela’s flyer.]",3,10,40
Pam," If you’re using more than three pieces of tape to wrap a present, you’re doing it wrong. ",3,10,40
Pam," Oh, I just get those at any party supply place. ",3,10,40
Pam, Hello everyone. We would just like to announce that our party is starting now in the break room. So… you can come by… .,3,10,40
Pam, Our party is also starting now [opens door to break room.],3,10,40
Pam, Good choice. [Kelly drags Ryan to the break room.],3,10,40
Pam, [holds up rice krispie shaped like a star] In the name of Nutcracker Christmas.  					,3,10,40
Pam, We should get him a bus ticket. [types on computer] To make his trip easier.,3,10,40
Pam, Hey. You have a bunch of messages and… [sees Michael shaking head with beads in hair] that’s nice. Hannah quit while you were gone. I guess she memo-ed to file some complaints she had about being a working mother? And so you might also have to be deposed. ,3,11,41
Pam, That’s good. [Michael continues to play conch shell],3,11,41
Pam," But you can’t today, we’re doing inventory.",3,11,41
Pam," We couldn’t do it without you, so we postponed. ",3,11,41
Pam, Oh my God. Is that Jan? [points to same monitor] ,3,11,41
Pam," How far away does she live now, like ten minutes? ",3,11,41
Pam," Honestly, I think you should go easy on her.  ",3,11,41
Pam," No, I didn’t mind helping Jim with his problem. That’s what friends do. I help Phyllis all the time. Just yesterday, I untangled a piece of tape from her hair. So, yeah.   ",3,11,41
Pam," Oh, don’t worry about it. I mean, it’s better than listening to Michael play a conch shell… which is what I was doing. Oh, also, Michael went to Jamaica with Jan!",3,11,41
Pam," [on phone] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Just a second. Michael, it’s Jan on the phone for you.",3,11,41
Pam, Jan called. She’s coming in later to talk to you.,3,11,41
Pam," Oh, yeah, no. Don’t worry about it. I mean, he was being ridiculous.",3,11,41
Pam, [Dwight hands out handkerchief] Thanks. You don’t need to stay here.,3,11,41
Pam," Angela, you seem so happy. I bet you wish you were like this all the time. ",3,12,42
Pam," Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. [excited] This is Pam. I did?  					",3,12,42
Pam, Yeah I did a watercolor of Frances Willard Elementary School for a contest they were having. They were calling with the results. And I won. I won! My painting won. So I like to thank my mom for always encouraging me. And I like to thank my dad for buying me my first set of art pencils. And I’d like to thank the sixth grade class that picked me.  					,3,12,42
Pam," Hey Kev, guess what. I won an art contest today.",3,12,42
Pam," Hey, Angela. I got good news today too. I won an art contest.",3,12,42
Pam, Hmm. I don’t think so. But thanks. My building manager… is… You understand.,3,12,42
Pam, Do you want me to ask the cleaning crew if they stopped watering it?,3,13,43
Pam," Oh, that wasn’t the night crew. That was Dwight.",3,13,43
Pam," Oh, I’m kind of in the middle of — yes please.",3,13,43
Pam, I think we broke his brain. [they both snicker],3,13,43
Pam," Something’s up with Jim and Karen.  Not that I’ve been eavesdropping.  It’s not really any of my business, but I’ve gotten pretty good at reading the back of Jim’s neck.  ",3,14,44
Pam, Never underestimate the power of a good night’s sleep.,3,14,44
Pam," When I get eight hours, compared to like six hours, like, big difference.",3,14,44
Pam, Oh yeah.  Gotta get your REM cycle going with the whole sleeping.  Better than not.,3,14,44
Pam, Yeah.  Don’t fall asleep at your desk.  [Turning towards the vending machine] Oh my God.  ,3,14,44
Pam, But don’t you also have girlfriends in Paris?  Like a lot of them?,3,14,44
Pam," Ben Franklin, do you wear boxers, briefs, or pantaloons?",3,14,44
Pam, Well I like to think that his dad was a Ben Franklin impersonator and he really pressured him into it.,3,14,44
Pam," Oh no, I was confused by your phrasing.  You should definitely go out with Jim.  I mean, you’re going out with Jim.  I’m not going out with Jim.  You’re dating him, which is awesome, because you guys are great together.  ",3,14,44
Pam, Nothing.  I was just thinking of something else.  ,3,14,44
Pam," Yeah, right.  God, I need a boyfriend.  You know Ryan I’m totally ready to be set up with one of your business school friends.  Whenever.",3,14,44
Pam, Yeah?  I lose my appetite all the time.,3,14,44
Pam," Phyllis… ended up using the exact same invitations as Roy and me. So it was kind of like being invited to my own wedding. And I was like ‘Wait, thought I called that off’.  					",3,15,45
Pam, Oh… um… no.  That’s… um… That’s actually fine,3,15,45
Pam," Okay, that’s a lot of good ideas. Thanks  					",3,15,45
Pam," Roy, I picked those flowers. Phyllis just stole all of my ideas for our wedding.",3,15,45
Pam," Yeah, that’s weird. I thought they only played the Police.",3,15,45
Pam," Okay, just so you know, it’s just the students from my class in a little studio.",3,16,46
Pam, I’m really happy to be back with Roy. I think it shows maturity. Maturity and dignity. … Is that braggy? I don’t mean it to be braggy.  				,3,16,46
Pam," Oh, yeah! We have such a solid foundation, you know.",3,16,46
Pam," Yeah. Oh, you should come to my art show, by the way.",3,16,46
Pam," I mean, it’s not a big deal, but I think a lot of people from the office will be there.",3,16,46
Pam," Not that I call myself an impressionist, per se.",3,16,46
Pam," I still need… you know, my breakthrough, or whatever. [Woman leaves, Roy enters] Hey, babe, how are you?",3,16,46
Pam," Yeah, I’ll just, I’ll drive myself home. ",3,16,46
Pam," So we shouldn’t help you, no matter how much you might beg and plead?",3,17,47
Pam," Hey, Michael left early, so a bunch of us are going to go to Poor Richard’s for happy hour. You should come. ",3,17,47
Pam," Ok, well, we’re going to a bar. Hey. You have to come to stuff with me. I’m serious! If you’re going to be my boyfriend, you have to do boyfriend things. ",3,17,47
Pam," I have decided that I’m going to be more honest. I’m going to tell people what I want. Directly. So, look out world, cause ol’ Pammy is getting what she wants. And, don’t call me Pammy.   ",3,17,47
Pam," [looks at beers] Oh. [Starts to walk away, turns around] No. Actually, one of these is supposed to be a lite.",3,17,47
Pam," Hey, where have you been all night? I was looking forward to hanging out with you. ",3,17,47
Pam, I want us to make it. I want a fresh start.,3,17,47
Pam," Oh ok, but in order for us to make it, there can’t be any secrets between us. ",3,17,47
Pam, Just listen. Remember that casino night about a month before we were supposed to get married? I kissed Jim.,3,17,47
Pam," He told me how he felt and I guess I had feelings too, and we kissed.",3,17,47
Pam," I really don’t want to talk about it.  I don’t mean to be rude, but I just… I don’t want to comment on what happened.  It ",3,18,48
Pam," Michael, the pants don’t have any pockets.",3,18,48
Pam, It’s been a really rough couple of days… This helps a little.  				,3,18,48
Pam," He could have broken your nose or something.  Crazy.  It’s just so stupid.  I mean, getting back with Roy and everything.  I mean, what was I thinking, right?",3,18,48
Pam," Not anymore.  It’s, um… It’s completely over now.",3,18,48
Pam," I’m sorry too.  I just, I think that we both made some bad choices.  ",3,18,48
Pam," I don’t know how the whole betting thing started, but it’s fun.  					",3,19,49
Pam, It’s really hard to demonstrate depression.  Their safety training had visuals.,3,19,49
Pam, What are the odds that this is in any way real?,3,19,49
Pam," Hey Michael!  I have a present for you, but you have to come down and get it.",3,19,49
Pam," [on phone] Yes, I understand.  Can I transfer you to customer relations?",3,20,50
Pam," Yeah, she has a good point.  I mean, for example, with the last thing you said, by the time you explained it, it actually took up more time.",3,20,50
Pam," Yes, I’ll be sure someone returns your call.  I’m so sorry.  Bye.",3,20,50
Pam, You know what?  I really think the whole thing is just gonna blow over in like a week or two.,3,20,50
Pam, Michael likes me to run the camera when he makes his apology videos.  He says he needs a woman’s touch.  				,3,20,50
Pam, Cut.  That was your best apology video ever.,3,20,50
Pam," Hey, Dwight.  You look really nice today.",3,20,50
Pam," [door opens] Hey, Phyllis. You all right?",3,21,51
Pam, [to Phyllis] Can you tell us what happened?,3,21,51
Pam," [whispering] It’s just, like, so creepy.",3,21,51
Pam," Oh, some guy exposed himself to Phyllis in the parking lot.",3,21,51
Pam," Yeah, Bob Vance took her for a walk to calm down.",3,21,51
Pam," I don’t often miss Roy. But I can tell you one thing. I wish someone had flashed me when I was with Roy. Because that would have been the ass-kicking of the year. [small laugh] Especially if it had been Jim. He would not have wanted me to have seen Jim’s… Whoo, I am… I am saying a lot of things.  				",3,21,51
Pam, That’s OK. I don’t feel like answering phones.,3,21,51
Pam," [reads memo] “Sleeves down to the wrists, buttoned-up collars, and muted colors.” Nobody dress like that. [camera pans over to Angela]",3,21,51
Pam," OK. New topic. Kelly, how are things with Ryan?",3,21,51
Pam," Michael, you shouldn’t do anything that you’re uncomfortable with.",3,21,51
Pam," No, normal women don’t do stuff like that. This is bad. [Karen nods and Michael looks like he’s about to start crying] ",3,21,51
Pam, Michael… you shouldn’t be with someone who doesn’t make you happy.,3,21,51
Pam, Maybe. But it sounds like you’re just wrong for each other.,3,21,51
Pam, I’m kind of in-between boyfriends right now. So I don’t need anything sexy. But I do need some new hand towels. I figure I can cut up this robe.  				,3,21,51
Pam," Here, uh… Meredith? Why don’t you put your hazards on.",3,21,51
Pam," I don’t think we really need that, Michael.",3,21,51
Pam," You know, I changed a tire today. All by myself. This bathrobe’s already coming in handy. [Meredith honking] Coming!  				",3,21,51
Pam," About 40 times a year, Michael gets really sick, but has no symptoms. Dwight is always gravely concerned.  				",3,22,52
Pam," Oh, great. I forgot mine and I’m wearing a two piece. ",3,22,52
Pam, I thought we were just having fun at the beach.,3,22,52
Pam, You want me to write down people’s indefinable qualities? ,3,22,52
Pam," I have the most boring job in the office, so… why wouldn’t I have the most boring job on beach day?  				",3,22,52
Pam," There’s nothing better than a beautiful day at the beach, filled with sun, surf, and uh… diligent note-taking. [holds up notes]",3,22,52
Pam, Does it have to do with these shopping bags filled with hot dogs? ,3,22,52
Pam," I think they’re even. At various times you gave Jim ten points, Dwight a gold star, and Stanley a thumbs up. And I don’t really know how to compare those units. ",3,22,52
Pam," I’m gonna do it. And I fully expect to burn my feet and go to the hospital. That’s the right spirit when doing a coal walk, right? ",3,22,52
Pam, But I’m not kidding.  I really want to do it.,3,22,52
Pam," [breathes deeply and runs across coals] Oooh, uh hah, ooh! Wha-hoo! Ahhhh…  				",3,22,52
Pam," [runs over after walking over fire coals] Hey! I want to say something. I’ve been trying to be more honest lately and I just need to say a few things. I did the coal walk! Just, I did it! Michael, you couldn’t even do that.  Maybe I should be your boss? Wow, I feel really good right now.  Why didn’t any of you come to my art show? I invited all of you.  That really sucked. It’s like sometimes some of you act like I don’t even exist.  [turns and looks directly at Jim] Jim, I called off my wedding because of you. And now we’re not even friends.  And things are just like weird between us, and that sucks. And I miss you. You were my best friend before you went to Stamford, and I really miss you. I shouldn’t have been with Roy. And there were a lot of reasons to call off my wedding. But the truth is, I didn’t care about any of those reasons until I met you.  And now you’re with someone else. And that’s… fine. It’s… whatever. That’s not what… I’m not… Okay, my feet really hurt. The thing that I’m just trying to say to you, Jim… and to everyone else in this circle I guess, is that I miss having fun with you. Just you, not everyone in the circle. Okay, I am going to go walk in the water now. Yeah. It’s a good day. ",3,22,52
Pam," After I had my little outburst at the beach, Jim was really nice about it. He just basically said that he missed my friendship too and I would always mean a lot to him and I understand where he’s coming from.  For the record, I am not embarassed at all. It needed to be said, and I said it, and it only took me three years to summons the courage, so [quietly, and mock bowing] thank you.    				",3,23,53
Pam," Oh, no it’s not that, I’ve actually been thinking that for a long time, and I’m glad I said it. I just… I’m sorry if it made you feel weird. ",3,23,53
Pam," So, um, Michael needs us in the conference room. ",3,23,53
Pam, Just don’t get back together with her. ,3,23,53
Pam, This was a terrible relationship. You were not happy when you were with her. ,3,23,53
Pam, You’re so much happier now. Just go in there and be strong. ,3,23,53
Pam," No, it’s fine.  I’m sure it must have been weird for Jim when Roy and I were joking around… that ",3,23,53
Pam," I’m happy for him.  I hope he gets the job.  I really just want him to be happy.  And I know that sounds cliche.  And I know saying it sounds cliche, sounds cliche…  Maybe I’m being cliche.  I don’t care.  Cause I am what I am. [thinks] That’s Popeye.  				",3,23,53
Pam," Okay.  So… you would be the Regional Manager, ",3,23,53
Pam," I learned from Jim, if Dwight ever asks you to accept something secret… you reply, “Absolutely, I do.”  				",3,23,53
Pam, Then who do you think will get the job?,3,23,53
Pam, [raises hand] What is the cash value of a Schrute Buck?,3,23,53
Pam, I literally cannot wait to see what Dwight has planned.  And I wish Jim were here.  				,3,23,53
Pam, HEY!  COME ON!  Let’s listen to Dwight’s presentation! [Dwight winks at Pam],3,23,53
Pam," No, I don’t know what the future holds, but… I’m optimistic.  And, uh, I had fun goofing around with Dwight today.  Jim and I… are just… too similar.  Maybe one day I’ll find my own Karen. But— you— that is, a, um, you know, not— A man.  A man version.  But, uh, until then… I can hold my head up. … I’m not gay.  				",3,23,53
Pam," [phone rings, Pam answers] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.  Just one moment, I’ll transfer you.  				",3,23,53
Pam," I haven’t heard anything, but I bet Jim got the job.  I mean, why wouldn’t he?  He’s totally qualified, and smart, everyone loves him… and, if he never comes back again… that’s OK.  We’re friends.  And I’m sure we’ll stay friends.  We just, we never got the timing right.  You know?  I shot him down, and then he did the same to me, and…  But you know what?  It’s OK.  I’m totally fine.  Everything is gonna be totally— [Jim walks in]",3,23,53
Pam," [to camera, tearing up, smiling] I’m sorry, what was the question?  				",3,23,53
Pam, Jim and I went to dinner a few times when he got back from New York. I talked him through his break up. It’s really nice to be good friends again.  				,4,1,55
Pam, And Sunday I’m thinking of going to that flea-market at the drive-in.,4,1,55
Pam," Hey guys, we’re all gonna visit Meredith at lunch. And we’re kicking in $5 for flowers.",4,1,55
Pam, Can’t your other cats keep her company.,4,1,55
Pam," Angela, you’re the chairman of the party planning committee. I shouldn’t even be planning this, it’s your job.",4,1,55
Pam," OK, we’re leaving for the hospital at 1.",4,1,55
Pam," Alright, I will get a card at the hospital and we’ll sign it outside her room.",4,1,55
Pam, Sales people can go later in the day. Hourly works can go at lunch.,4,1,55
Pam, [puts hand up for high five] Same religion.,4,1,55
Pam," [Pam’s car pulls out of parking lot and then off to the side of the road] I told you I’m not dating anyone. And even if I was, I don’t think it’s anyone’s business. I mean, when I do fall in love, like when it’s for real, the last person I’m gonna talk about it too is a camera crew, or my co-workers. [Jim gets into the passenger side] Almost marrying Roy Anderson was as close to Pamela Anderson as I ever want to be. [Jim leans over and kisses Pam] Trust me, when I fall in love, you’ll know.  				",4,1,55
Pam," Michael Scott’s Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton, Meredith Palmer memorial, celebrity rabies awareness, fun run race for the cure, this is Pam.",4,1,55
Pam, Pro-Am race for the… They hung up.  				,4,1,55
Pam," Ah, yeah. We haven’t told anybody, but it’s going really great. [looks at Jim] Right?",4,1,55
Pam," Well a giant check costs about $200.00 to make up. I have a print shop standing by but… What do you think Michael, that’s over 25% of our funds?",4,1,55
Pam," Not well. A doctor won’t come out to collect a check for $700.00, or $500.00 if we go with the giant check.",4,1,55
Pam, And also there is no such thing as a rabies doctor.,4,1,55
Pam," Michael, 5k means 5 kilometers, not 5 thousand miles. [knocks]",4,1,55
Pam, So I closed the door but the image of his…,4,1,55
Pam, [Michael knocks slowly on door] Come in.,4,1,55
Pam," On average, how many hours a day do you spend naked in your office? Just ballpark.",4,1,55
Pam, I didn’t see where it started but I saw where it ended.,4,1,55
Pam, They say if you’re nervous around someone you should picture them naked. I do not recommend this strategy. Try picturing them with more clothes on… or a funny coat.  				,4,1,55
Pam, I don’t know I’m really committed to winning.,4,1,55
Pam," [holding lamp] You like it? It’s kinda designy and cool, it was $8.00.",4,1,55
Pam," Yeah. Hey Michael, look at this lamp. $8.00.",4,1,55
Pam," And Michael, you don’t have rabies. And chances are you’re not going to get it anytime soon. So… you don’t really have to think about it too much.",4,1,55
Pam," Yeah, but there’s other, better people out there who are helping.",4,1,55
Pam, I gotcha one. [Pam hands over a grape soda to Jim],4,2,56
Pam," No. Thanks… uh we’re still having lunch today, right?",4,2,56
Pam," Toby, was this your fun little way of congratulating us?",4,2,56
Pam, Phone’s ringing. [goes back toward desk],4,2,56
Pam, [reading from paper] Can you make that straighter? That job looks hard. You should put your mouth on that. How can you even use that one naturally?,4,2,56
Pam," Well, I don’t wanna speak for Jim, but, it’s like pretty official. [Jim smiles]",4,2,56
Pam, [sees Ryan coming through door] Hey Ryan. Welcome back —,4,2,56
Pam," No, they have been dating for like two years. [Jim in shock] Since before your barbeque.",4,2,56
Pam, Michael told us to wait in here. We don’t know why.,4,2,56
Pam, I think that I should help him get home.,4,2,56
Pam," Whoa, Toby.  Watch out.  You’re going to violate your own PDA memo.",4,2,56
Pam,"  I saw it.  I saw it, and it was amazing!  Who said I didn’t see it?  Did Jim say that I didn’t see it? I saw it!  				",4,3,57
Pam,  Michael? This is the press release I was telling you about.  Ryan wants you to share it with everyone.,4,3,57
Pam,  Dwight mercy killed Angela’s cat.  It’s very complicated.  It’s caused a lot of unpleasantness between Dwight and Angela.  Who are both already prone to unpleasantness.  				,4,3,57
Pam,  What kind of prank are you thinking?  				,4,3,57
Pam,"  Uh, just one second.  We’re in a meeting and I’ll see if he’s available.  It’s Jan.  				",4,3,57
Pam,"  Here’s a suggestion computer.  I assume you read binary so why don’t you zero one one, one one one one, zero one one zero one one. ",4,3,57
Pam," Michael, Ryan wants to introduce the branch managers in a few minutes.  You just have to wave and introduce yourself.",4,3,57
Pam," Yeah, enjoy this moment, because you’re never going to go back to this time before you met your desk mate Dwight.",4,3,57
Pam," You came up to my desk, and said, this might sound weird, and there’s no reason for me to know this, but that mixed berry yogurt you’re about to eat has expired.",4,3,57
Pam," He’s a big Meryl Streep fan, so I shouldn’t be surprised that he’s identified with her character.  ",4,4,58
Pam, Like the main company number? Because I’m gonna have to call information.,4,4,58
Pam, Mo Chuisle. He’s watching Million Dollar Baby… He’s gonna try to kill me.  ,4,4,58
Pam," [on the phone] Michael, it’s Ryan for you.",4,4,58
Pam," We only had tonight free, and we really wanted to spend it with you.",4,4,58
Pam," You wouldn’t understand, Jim. It’s a secret.  ",4,4,58
Pam, Thank you. Eh. The Embassy Beets. Radishon!,4,4,58
Pam, I don’t know! [Mose starts running by the left side of the car],4,4,58
Pam, [Pam sees Mose in an outhouse] Oh my God. What century is this?  ,4,4,58
Pam," [Pam and Jim hear Dwight crying] Ugh, your turn.",4,4,58
Pam," Michael. Morning. Hey Dwight, how are you?",4,4,58
Pam," It’s ‘whom’ when it’s the object of a sentence, and ‘who’ when it’s the subject.",4,4,58
Pam," Um, I don’t know if I really see you two together.",4,4,58
Pam," Okay, well she takes her convictions pretty seriously, she can be kind of severe.",4,4,58
Pam," Now that I think about it, Angela and Andy might actually make a good couple.  But I couldn’t do that to Dwight… or Angela… or Andy.  ",4,4,58
Pam," What’s going on, why do you have a second job?",4,4,58
Pam," Man, Angela really had a hold on him. [Dwight playing the recorder in the background]  Angela.  ",4,4,58
Pam," We wrote a good review.  Under comments, we wrote, the natural aroma of the beets drifts into the bedroom and makes you dream of simpler times.",4,4,58
Pam, The architecture reminds one of a quaint Tuscan beet farm.  ,4,4,58
Pam," Hey, I was thinking about dinner— [Jim grabs her face and kisses her]",4,4,58
Pam, Jim’s just really passionate about Italian food.  ,4,4,58
Pam, I’m taking a computer animation class so I could try to do a logo.,4,5,59
Pam, He looks a lot like you. How much time did you spend on that?,4,5,59
Pam, Right… you’re a sports writer in Philadelphia? Nice build too. ,4,5,59
Pam, You have a guitar slung on your back. I did not know you played guitar.,4,5,59
Pam," No no no, I want to see more of Philly Jim. I want Philly Jim.",4,5,59
Pam," Maybe, but it’s not good enough for me yet.",4,5,59
Pam," No no, you can go home. I’m good.  				",4,5,59
Pam," I worked until about 2:45 AM. And then I had to decide if I wanted to spend the night with Michael editing in his office, and Dwight watching Michael edit in his office, or drive home and probably fall asleep at the wheel and die in a fiery car wreck. I passed out on my keyboard trying to decide.   				",4,5,59
Pam," Certainly. [makes beeping noises] Okay, clear. ",4,5,59
Pam," Okay, well I have the tablecloth, don’t forget the flatware.",4,6,60
Pam," Oscar, Toby, and I are founding members of the Finer Things Club.  We meet once a month to discuss books and art, celebrate culture in a very civilized way.  Sometimes the debate can get heated, but we’re always respectful.  There is no paper, no plastic, and no work talk allowed.  It’s very exclusive.  				",4,6,60
Pam, Because some people think you monopolize the conversation by trying to be funny.,4,6,60
Pam," I have Ben Nugent on the line, he is the top salesman in Utica.",4,6,60
Pam," And spend time with George Emerson.  That’s what I would do.  I mean it’s the best male protagonist we’ve read, right?",4,6,60
Pam," Uh, I’m sorry Andy, but this is a closed club.  				",4,6,60
Pam," I think it’s interesting how Forster uses Italy to represent sexuality and passion. [Kevin dumping change in the snack machine] And that also brought up themes of, uh, you know, fate and coincidence.  And Lucy’s torn between these two things.  She’s torn between passion and convention.",4,6,60
Pam," It just- [Kevin banging and shaking the snack machine]  To be making a case for passion in Edwardian times, I thought was, uh…",4,6,60
Pam, Maybe sort of ahead of his time as a writer.,4,6,60
Pam," Why don’t you use the microwave in the kitchen, Phyllis?",4,6,60
Pam," I’m so sorry, Rolando told me everything.  How humiliating.  Would it help you to return to another age?  A time of refinement, and civility.",4,6,60
Pam, Ryan invited some of the branch managers and Toby into the woods for a “get to know you” weekend. Michael wasn’t invited. Apparently they already knew everything they needed to know about him.   				,4,7,61
Pam, Do you want me to ask where you’re going?,4,7,61
Pam," Wow! You’re shaking things up a bit, huh?",4,7,61
Pam,"  Not almost, though, Holly. I mean, not — not close to 200…",5,1,63
Pam,"  Tomorrow I start a three-month design program at the Pratt Institute in New York. I will be a little fish in the big apple. [does hand gesture] What up, 212?  				",5,1,63
Pam,  Ceramics class. Then dinner by myself. I’m gonna watch HGTV and maybe go to Bungalow 8 with John Mayer.,5,1,63
Pam,  Can you put me down I’m getting a little nauseous?,5,1,63
Pam,"  New York is so exciting. I love my classes. The city’s awesome. Um, can you give me back to Jim now, please?  				",5,1,63
Pam,  Hi. [they kiss] Mmm. ‘Cause– [looks toward camera],5,1,63
Pam,"  Hey!  Jim! Um, listen, can I call you back in a little bit?  I made friends!  				",5,1,63
Pam,  You’ve already disappointed him so much.  He can’t be expecting a lot from you.,5,1,63
Pam,"  I… listen, umm, we’re still good for this weekend, right?  ",5,1,63
Pam,"  No football games, recitals, karate tournaments.",5,1,63
Pam,"  Hey!  This is not half-way!  I did the math.  I had to drive way longer than you.  Montclair would have been closer, so you have to buy lunch.",5,1,63
Pam, Not one of them called to congratulate me on our engagement.,5,2,64
Pam," No, nothing.  Nothing Michael!  Just saying hi. [Michael waves “hi” at the phone]",5,2,64
Pam," There’s no one from England, Jim.  Katie studied in Ireland – this is Stacy, the one who does the Murakami-style collages.",5,3,65
Pam," So, Stacy and Eric get to Bogre’s DeTech half an hour early so they don’t have to sit on the slab.  ",5,3,65
Pam," Anyway, Bogre’s TA Sarah Kaya comes in.",5,3,65
Pam," No, Sarah Kaya comes in.  Don’t interrupt, I have like thirty seconds to finish this and get to DigiPres.",5,3,65
Pam," So Sarah Kaya says to Eric, “No way.  You can’t reserve seats.” And Stacy gets all up in her face and Sarah Kaya picks up Stacy’s new PM pad and throws it at the light box. ",5,3,65
Pam," No, it’s horrible!  Jim, she might get arrested.",5,3,65
Pam," No, Stacy is a boy.  Ugh.  Frustrating.  Why can’t you just be in art class with me?",5,3,65
Pam," Oh, wait, I gotta go, class starting. [hangs up]",5,3,65
Pam, Not even. I’m doing laundry for the first time in like a month.,5,3,65
Pam," I can’t hear anything, there’s like, there’s like machines going-",5,3,65
Pam," I’m not frustrated. Even if I were in Scranton, Jim and I would have days like this. We’re just… a little out of sync.  You know, that’s all.  Oh, great.  I washed my lipstick.  				",5,3,65
Pam," [on voicemail, because she’s calling Jim at the same time] Hi, this is Pam.  Leave a message.",5,3,65
Pam," I figured I’d catch you walking to your car, but… ",5,3,65
Pam, I guess this is just one of those days.  It’ll get better.,5,3,65
Pam, I finished my laundry.  Got all my socks.  Nothing like that time that crazy guy pushed you.,5,3,65
Pam," And then, remember, we went shopping the next day to buy me a washer and dryer?",5,3,65
Pam," You’re probably upset that I’m even at a Laundromat right now.  But, don’t worry, I’m being safe.  And I’m headed home.  I’m… headed to my dorm.  Not home.",5,3,65
Pam," New York, as it turns out, is very expensive, and I ran out of money. I thought about selling a kidney, but Michael offered to get me a part-time job at corporate.  				",5,4,66
Pam," Of course, now Michael knows where to reach me 16 to 18 hours a week.  				",5,4,66
Pam, Thanks.  My costume’s getting a lot of attention. [Pam is dressed as Charlie Chaplin]  				,5,5,67
Pam," So apparently no one dresses up for Halloween here. I wish I had known that before I used greasepaint for my moustache. And I can’t even take off my hat, because then I’m Hitler.  				",5,5,67
Pam," I asked Tom and Pete to come early so we could play a prank on Jim at lunch! Pretty awesome, right? I think they’re into the idea. They’re probably thinking, “That Pam Beasly, she’s the coolest sister-in-law on the planet. She’s the best! The absolute best.”  				",5,5,67
Pam," Okay, so here’s what I’m thinking. I’m gonna say that before ceramics class, I took off my ring, and then when I changed back out of my smock, it wasn’t in my pocket anymore, and I lost it. ",5,5,67
Pam," So, not the ring then? The- the- Not doing the ring?",5,5,67
Pam, They came up with that idea really fast.  				,5,5,67
Pam, Yup! [Tom and Pete give Halpertian looks to camera]  				,5,5,67
Pam, I don’t know if I’m gonna make any money with art.,5,5,67
Pam," I mean it’s a very competitive field. But I have a professor who says I have a lot of promise, and if I don’t try now, I never will. So…",5,5,67
Pam," For the record, I wanted go another direction. Which was way better.",5,5,67
Pam," Okay. I lost my engagement ring in ceramics class. Left it in my smock. I had this whole thing where I go back to class, wrongly accuse another girl. Look I even used makeup to put a ring around my finger, you can hardly see it, it’s very subtle. ",5,5,67
Pam, Oh. Hey how about at Thanksgiving we prank Tom about being bald?  				,5,5,67
Pam," [on Bluetooth speaker] Hey, New York ain’t free. Get back to work.",5,6,68
Pam," It’s the world’s tiniest Bluetooth. I found it in a Japanese gadget store in the village. I got one for Jim, too. Jim, say something.",5,6,68
Pam," We wanted to stay on the phone all day, but the company has a policy against eight-hour personal calls. So we’re not telling anyone.",5,6,68
Pam, [Dwight slams something on desk] What was that?,5,6,68
Pam, Describe him exactly. What color mustard is his shirt? Yellow or Dijon?,5,6,68
Pam, Maybe it’s because you spent the whole year flirting with the receptionist.,5,6,68
Pam," [in New York, humming to herself to the tune of “Centerfold”] Na na na na na. Na na na na na na na.  ",5,6,68
Pam, [in New York] That’s what she said! That’s what she said! That’s what she said!,5,6,68
Pam, Have you ever had a conversation with Kelly where she didn’t go on for 15 minutes without taking a breath?,5,6,68
Pam," Yes, I said you definitely should go, but you wanted to visit me instead.",5,6,68
Pam," Oh, I love Chuck Close and his photo-realist paintings. But I have to work.",5,6,68
Pam," Because they have a great design program, and I wanted to see if I was any good at it. And I wanted to work on my art, too.",5,6,68
Pam, [at school in NYC] Can’t believe this. [pulls out cell phone… sighs],5,7,69
Pam, [over the phone] I just talked to my advisor. Failing.,5,7,69
Pam," I was, and then they switched to Acrobat just as I was learning Quark.  I hate computers.",5,7,69
Pam, That means another twelve weeks.  [pause] Can you do this for another three months?,5,7,69
Pam," [over phone] Yeah I’m fine.  Um… my cell phone battery’s low, so I have to let you go.",5,7,69
Pam," I’m coming back the wrong way.  [smiles at Jim across the parking lot] It’s not because of you.  I don’t like graphic design. That’s it. [laughs] Stop smiling. I really didn’t like it.  It’s just designing logos and stuff…. and I miss Scranton.  But it is not because I missed you. I just really wanted to come home… and I know you said to come home the right way, but you can’t tell me what to do. Got it?",5,7,69
Pam," [pours something from the fridge into a bowl and opens the microwave, it is covered in exploded food] Oh, come on! [to the documentary crew] Do you see this?  Disgusting.  				",5,8,70
Pam," Yeah.  Wait, what, the mess or the note?",5,8,70
Pam, Don’t you think the person who left the mess is the obnoxious one?,5,8,70
Pam," Just because someone likes things clean, doesn’t mean they’re rich.",5,8,70
Pam," When it comes down to it, it’s a health issue.  I should have written that. ",5,8,70
Pam, [looks up] Why aren’t you as mad or interested in this as me?,5,8,70
Pam," “Please hug and kiss me, no matter how hard I struggle.  I’m too shy to tell you that I love you.”",5,8,70
Pam," I guess that’s why we have a temp, huh?",5,8,70
Pam, How would wiping it with a paper towel make it worse?,5,8,70
Pam," You’ve seen things cleaned before though, right?",5,8,70
Pam, [getting out of the car] What are we doing at your parent’s house?,5,8,70
Pam," Um, do we have to sleep in your parent’s bedroom?",5,8,70
Pam," Yes, Michael, new chairs. These chairs are terrible. We were supposed to get new ones last year.",5,9,71
Pam," [over indistinct conversation] Good? Yeah, he said good, I’m good…",5,9,71
Pam," Oscar, no. This is not the time for one of your principled stands.",5,9,71
Pam, Exactly. That should tell you how terrible the chairs are.,5,9,71
Pam," I’ve talked to Meredith, Stanley and Jim about the chairs. I know they’re with me on this.",5,9,71
Pam," So um, I’ve been thinking about this whole chair/copier thing…",5,9,71
Pam, But I really think you should reconsider.,5,9,71
Pam," Jim. Jim, Jim, Jim. I’m not threatening you. I love you. [whispers] But you should know, you’re on very dangerous ground [kisses Jim]. [at normal volume] All right.",5,9,71
Pam," Remember, you were gonna get a new chair, and you were gonna give your old chair to me. Remember that?",5,9,71
Pam," So, I guess that’s how they’re gonna play this. It is on. [very serious] It is so on.  				",5,9,71
Pam," Look, I really need this new chair. I mean, seriously, how is it possible that in five years I’ve had two engagement rings, and only one chair?  				",5,9,71
Pam," That’s cool. [opens the container and smells the tiramisu] Mm, good stuff. [throws it in the garbage]",5,9,71
Pam, Thank you. [goes to Michael’s office and knocks on the door],5,9,71
Pam," Hey, have I told you you look really nice today?",5,9,71
Pam," Yeah! Oh, so I guess Oscar and Jim were talking your ear off about the new copier.",5,9,71
Pam, Yeah. I have my copies. [holds up messed up copies],5,9,71
Pam," And I have my original. [holds up original paper, ripped in half]",5,9,71
Pam, You’re gonna give yourself a bonus of $645 instead of getting the entire office something it really needs?,5,9,71
Pam," Let me just say, you’ve been promising me this chair since the day you hired me.",5,9,71
Pam, I wish that you’d stop rubbing that lamp in that creepy way.,5,10,72
Pam," I know.  If she wasn’t an alcoholic before, she is now. [Jim laughs]  				",5,10,72
Pam," Angela made several 911 calls about cars going too fast in front of the building, so the police put up a radar gun. It’s actually caused a bit of a traffic hazard.  				",5,11,73
Pam," Okay, be careful, Kevin. They’re kind of spicy.",5,11,73
Pam," So, maybe just try one at first, and then if it’s okay, have a couple more…",5,11,73
Pam," Angela, you have to put a stop to this right now.",5,11,73
Pam," Ladies, are we prepared to let the Kevins of the world decide anything for us? Anything at all? We don’t even give him full internet access.",5,12,74
Pam," No, because… [Dwight and Michael walk in and march into Michael’s office, silencing the conversation]",5,12,74
Pam," [points to smoke] Oh, my God! Uh, Oh my God! ",5,13,75
Pam," We don’t normally download films illegally.  Because we’re honest,  hardworking people. ",5,13,75
Pam," But Andy does, so we have to watch it with him.",5,13,75
Pam, My dad spent the night at our place last night.  My parents have been fighting for weeks and… it kinda sucks.  Jim’s been great. But I’m gonna need to buy my dad a robe.   				,5,13,75
Pam," Hi dad. Yeah Jim has shaving cream, check our bathroom.  				",5,13,75
Pam, So he doesn’t share it with his daughter but he shares it with his daughter’s fiance?,5,13,75
Pam," Um, did my dad say anything about my mom?",5,13,75
Pam," I dunno. I mean, maybe he’ll talk to you about some of this stuff ’cause he can’t really talk to me about it.",5,13,75
Pam," What? [opens her eyes, Michael is standing over her] Oh… ",5,13,75
Pam," Dunder Mifflin this is Pam. Oh, hey Mom. No, what did Dad say?  				",5,13,75
Pam," After you talked, he called my mom and said he was gonna look for an apartment.",5,13,75
Pam, What could Jim have said to make my dad want to leave my mom? And at what point in our marriage is he gonna say it to me?  				,5,13,75
Pam," Well I just want to take a minute to talk to you all about something very serious. Once every hour, someone is involved in an internet scam. That man is Michael Scott. [laughter] He’s supporting about 20 Nigerian princesses.",5,13,75
Pam," Well, ya know, Michael is a great delegator. He never does any work himself. Ever. And one time, I walked in on him naked, and his thing is so small. [quickly walks off stage] If it were an iPod it would be a shuffle! [clapping, laughter]",5,13,75
Pam," Dunder Mifflin this is Pam. Uh, I’m sorry, Michael’s not here right now can I take a message? Great. I will. Thanks.  				",5,13,75
Pam,"  Hey Dad. No I know, Mom told me. Ok. Yeah I’ll see ya then.  				",5,13,75
Pam," Yeah. He said that you told him how much you love me. About how you feel when I walk in a room, and about how, you’ve never doubted for a second that I’m the woman you want to spend the rest of your life with. I guess he’s never felt that with my mom, even at their best.",5,13,75
Pam,"  When you’re a kid you assume your parents are soul mates. My kids are gonna be right about that. I guess it also means that sometimes love affairs look different to the people inside them. [Andy is in the background, looks incredulous]  				",5,13,75
Pam," Yeah. I love being on the road, but I especially love the time and a half pay 24 hours a day, for three days. Cause I have a mortgage now, got a bring home the bucks.",5,14,76
Pam, But then you fall asleep and there’s nothing for me to do.,5,14,76
Pam, That’s okay I can… I’m fine. I’ll just play a song in my head.,5,14,76
Pam," No, I’m not even wearing that much.  				",5,14,76
Pam," I hate the idea that someone out there hates me. I even hate thinking that Al-Qaeda hates me. I think if they got to know me, they wouldn’t hate me. But Karen knows me, and she still hates me, so…  				",5,14,76
Pam," [taking Michael’s picture] Okay, uh, point at the Dunder Mifflin.  				",5,14,76
Pam," Wow, that is wonderful, congratulations.",5,14,76
Pam, What is happening there? [points at picture],5,14,76
Pam," Uh, they’re good. Uh, Jim’s good. We’re engaged.",5,14,76
Pam," I’m serious. Um, I’m really glad I came.",5,14,76
Pam," Because, um, cause I’ll never wonder ever again. If I did something wrong and… Now I have closure. She’s happy and, I don’t know, it feels good.  				",5,14,76
Pam," Perfect boobs, [gives a look at the camera] of course I remember Holly.",5,14,76
Pam," So, detour. We’re now adding Nashua to the Lecture Circuit so Michael can confront Holly and get some closure. Nashua actually sounded very excited on the phone. I don’t think they get a lot of visitors. Because their office is only accessible by cross-country skis. Hey-oh! [laughs] [whispers] I’ve been driving too long.   ",5,15,77
Pam," [taking Michael’s picture] Okay, a little bit more closer to the sign. Yeah.  ",5,15,77
Pam," Listen, when Jim was dating Karen, I didn’t want to come to work. It was awful. I hated it. I wanted to quit, but-",5,15,77
Pam," You know, when Holly gets back, everyone will tell her what a great job you did. And then she’ll realize what she’s missing.",5,15,77
Pam," [whispering] No, no, no, you have to do it-",5,15,77
Pam," That was weird, huh? It’s all part of the presentation. It was confusing, right? Because confusing situations happen to us all the time in our jobs. [pauses] I’m just trying to bridge the gap between what just happened and the fact that I’m going to be doing the rest of the presentation.  [reading from the cards, in Forrest Gump voice] Sales is like a box a chocolates, you never know which vendor you’re gonna get. Forrest Gump.  ",5,15,77
Pam," [pointing to staff members] Blazer. Freckles. Penguin. K.D. Lang. Holly’s boyfriend. These mnemonic devices help to make a connection, and then, also to help you memorize names. I have a chainsaw! [holds up chainsaw, makes a wimpy chain saw noise] Cutting down the competition.  ",5,15,77
Pam, [loading up car with Michael] Don’t look up. Don’t look up. [sighs as office workers all looking from window]  ,5,15,77
Pam," No, under no circumstances can you read that letter. It’s a violation of her trust.",5,15,77
Pam, [to camera] What? I’m not in love with her.  ,5,15,77
Pam," I can’t tell you specifically, but… it’s not over. ",5,15,77
Pam," They have new phone systems now that can ring directly to a salesman, or someone presses star and they go to accounting, basically 95% of my job.  But I’d like to see a machine that puts out candy for everyone. [realizing] Vending machine.  				",5,16,78
Pam," [while leafing through Michael’s appointment book and seeing nothing but free time] Um, oh boy, let’s see, he’s really…",5,16,78
Pam, This is our first and only Valentine’s Day as fiances. ,5,16,78
Pam, I can’t see them when they’re on the floor,5,16,78
Pam," You can’t be a part of our relationship, Michael.",5,16,78
Pam," Yes, he bowled 5 frames with this pink sparkly thing until a little girl had to ask for her ball back.",5,16,78
Pam," No, you just have little dainty fingers.",5,16,78
Pam, What’s the rule about eating when people are in the bathroom?,5,16,78
Pam," Oh, damn. [Pam looks down at her salad] They’ve been in there for like ten minutes.",5,16,78
Pam, Yes.  And I think they gave him too many fries. ,5,16,78
Pam, [looking up from her pilfering of Bob’s food] What?,5,16,78
Pam," Well, you should cover it with the broccoli.",5,16,78
Pam, [exiting the Ladies’ room] Mine too. [Pam and Jim notice the Handicapped stall and walk towards it.  Putting their ears to the door they hear Mr. and Mrs. Vance being intimate],5,16,78
Pam," [on the phone] You can fax it over. Yeah, 5-7-0-5-5-5-0-1–",5,17,79
Pam," 0-1-7-5. Thank you. Bye, bye. [to Michael] It really makes us look unprofessional. ",5,17,79
Pam," Now there’s, there’s butter on my desk. ",5,17,79
Pam," [Michael walks in dressed as Willy Wonka] Good morning, Michael.",5,17,79
Pam," Good morning, Mr. Wonka, here are your messages.",5,17,79
Pam," You don’t have to wait that long. I mean, you don’t have to wait a month to ask her out. Just ask her out. ",5,17,79
Pam, That’s psychotic. Do guys actually do that? ,5,17,79
Pam," Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Oh hi ,David. [Michael shakes his head to Pam] No, I’m sorry he’s not back from the Civil Rights rally. I’ll have him call you the minute he gets back from the Lincoln Memorial.  ",5,17,79
Pam," When Michael’s skirting a phone call, he gave me a list of places to say he is. ‘Stopping a fight in the parking lot. ‘ ‘An Obama fashion show. ‘ Whatever… that is. Or ‘trapped in an oil painting.’ I’m gonna save that one.   ",5,17,79
Pam, Does that mean an idea that blows up in our faces later? [Pam’s phone rings],5,17,79
Pam," [on phone] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Oh hi, David. He’s having a colonoscopy. Alright, I’ll find out if he’s out yet.   ",5,17,79
Pam, I don’t think Jim means to say that you shouldn’t touch her.,5,17,79
Pam," [to Jim] Shush. [to Kevin] Kevin, a playful touch on the arm, or on the back, it can show your interest and it’s really romantic. ",5,17,79
Pam," [going up to give Dwight a hug] Thanks for much for helping the company, Dwight. ",5,17,79
Pam, It’s actually based on a book called Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.,5,17,79
Pam,"  This is the last day of our summer interns. It’s been nice. We haven’t had interns for a while, ever since Michael’s Monica Lewinsky incident. [interns are shown gathered around Kelly’s desk, one holding a box of tissues, as Kelly cries and wipes tears] He didn’t do anything sexual. [female intern opens a jar of salsa for Michael] He just made far, far too many Monica Lewinsky jokes. [Meredith rubs her breasts into Maurie’s back] It was just easier for corporate to shut down the program.  				",6,1,81
Pam, [talking head with Jim] We haven’t told anyone I’m pregnant.,6,1,81
Pam," Yeah, we don’t want them at the wedding thinking Jim’s being marched down the aisle by my dad with a shotgum.",6,1,81
Pam," Sure, but we should get to the bottom of this. Let’s pick a rumor and trace it back to the beginning.",6,1,81
Pam, [approaching Michael at elevators] Michael? [to others] He’s over here!,6,1,81
Pam, Don’t get on it. [Michael inches toward elevator],6,1,81
Pam," [talking head with Jim] It’s clear why we were trying not to tell people. That’s clear now. [Jim nods, looking at floor]  				",6,1,81
Pam, [exchanges looks with Jim] You’re right. We should’ve realized that you are an equal part of this.,6,1,81
Pam, [in disbelief] You called Stanley’s wife?,6,1,81
Pam," If you talk to her, you’re gonna tell her about Stanley, and that’s gonna seem more suspicious.",6,1,81
Pam,"   Okay, it’s just three or four steps but thank you, thank you.",6,2,82
Pam,"   Yeah, I think the pregnancy really brought us together.  ",6,2,82
Pam,"   Did I?  Doesn’t sound like me, not very superstitious.",6,2,82
Pam,   Please don’t talk about my breast milk.,6,2,82
Pam,"   Thank you.  Um, listen I just wanted to confirm that you’re not coming to the wedding, which is totally understandable and more than fine.  ",6,2,82
Pam,"   I don’t know, he hasn’t RSVP’d yet.     				",6,2,82
Pam,"   We invited everyone in the office to our wedding.  Even though we realized most people wouldn’t be able to make the drive to Niagara Falls.  [whispers] Which is why we’re having it in Niagara Falls.  [normal volume] Then Michael told everyone they could have Friday and Monday  off, if they came.  So now, people have to decide if they want to come to our wedding or have to work.    				",6,2,82
Pam,"   So, I just wanted to confirm that you’re not coming to my wedding.  ",6,2,82
Pam,   Can you just tell me now if you’re coming or not?,6,2,82
Pam,   Do you think that you could send in your RSVP card?,6,2,82
Pam,"   Well, you have to choose a food option and there’s information in there about directions and lodging… ",6,2,82
Pam,"   You are going to text me, the morning of my wedding. ",6,2,82
Pam,    And you will eat whatever is fanciest?  ,6,2,82
Pam,"   [sits down] Oh my gosh, I have been chasing people down all day.  It’s incredible.  ",6,2,82
Pam," I need to fit into my wedding dress. However, I’m also pregnant.",6,3,83
Pam," We did, but mostly because people expect us to. We’re also accepting other gifts not on the registry… However much.  				",6,3,83
Pam," It’s awkward asking people for money, but we could really use it. Why doesn’t Crate & Barrel let you register for a toaster full of cash?   				",6,3,83
Pam, I don’t think we registered anywhere. We just want cash.,6,3,83
Pam, Is this what I’ve become? Materialistic? Shallow? I feel horrible. [looks down at the check] oh look! “Mrs. Pam Halpert!” That’s the first time I’ve seen it in writing!  				,6,3,83
Pam," Why aren’t there any beans on this very old, frizzy-haired picture of me?",6,3,83
Pam," Yeah, I mean, if it’s all the same for you. ",6,3,83
Pam," Yeah. No, no, I’ll um– the hundred. I’ll just take the hundred.",6,3,83
Pam, The guy has an algorithm to determine the winner of any given college basketball game.  				,6,3,83
Pam," [writes a check, gives to Ryan] Don’t tell Jim.  				
",6,3,83
Pam," Phyllis, if you could switch to a different soap, just for a month or two? Yours is kind of perfumy.",6,4,84
Pam, I don’t think I’m asking for too much. I guess it’s just the end of courtesy in the workplace.  				,6,4,84
Pam," Yeah, but aren’t you supposed to do that to our… no. It’s great.",6,4,84
Pam, Ok. All of these things are important to remember but the most important thing is no one say anything about my pregnancy at the wedding.,6,4,84
Pam," Well, we’re thinking of my grandmother who we haven’t told and is very old-fashioned.",6,4,84
Pam," You know, Angela, you don’t have to come to the wedding.",6,4,84
Pam, Next time we’re all in this room Jim and I will be married.,6,4,84
Pam," [in car] Hey, my aunt told me something neat.",6,4,84
Pam, She said everything with the wedding goes by so fast we should try to take mental pictures of the high points.,6,4,84
Pam, We should have hired a professional to take our mental pictures.  				,6,4,84
Pam, Oh… is there another wedding at the hotel this weekend?,6,4,84
Pam," I’m gonna need the name and cell phone number of the housekeeper responsible for changing the sheets, please.  				",6,4,84
Pam," Oh, Mema? She’s the one in the teal suit. She’s the only 80 year old with no smile wrinkles.",6,4,84
Pam," Oscar, Kevin, this is my sister, Penny. She’s also my maid of honor.",6,4,84
Pam, Mema’s not coming to the wedding. She’s leaving tomorrow morning.,6,4,84
Pam, I was just going to go down to the hotel bar for a little bit.,6,4,84
Pam, I just wanted to get out of my room for a little while.,6,4,84
Pam," [on the phone] Hey, hey! Where are you?  Can you take Andy to the hospital?",6,4,84
Pam, Please stop saying what.  Can you take him?,6,4,84
Pam,  Your brothers took you out drinking?  ,6,4,84
Pam, That’s Michael.  You’re out with Michael?,6,4,84
Pam,"  Nope.  I, like you, have never been here before.",6,4,84
Pam,"  Look, I’m not the one who asked you to do a split when you’ve never done one before.  ",6,4,84
Pam, My job?  My job is to get married in the morning.  That’s my job.,6,4,84
Pam," Andy, did I dream that you were crying through the night?  ",6,4,84
Pam,"  Okay, here I come. [walks out in her wedding dress]  ",6,4,84
Pam," Okay great.  [Isabel kisses her cheek] Yeah, I’ll see you in a second.  [pauses] Wait, what? [tries to follow, but veil gets caught on wall and tears] Oh! Oh no!  				",6,4,84
Pam," No.  No, but I’m allowing it.  Just come here.  				",6,4,84
Pam, My veil tore.  I knew when we were getting married and I’m five months pregnant that I’m not going to be able to wear the dress that I always wanted or high heels–,6,4,84
Pam,"  No, this was the one thing I was supposed to be able to control, was this veil and– [Jim cuts off half his tie]",6,4,84
Pam, [sighs] Everyone’s driving me crazy.  I know way too much about Andy’s scrotum.  [Jim chuckles] And my mom won’t stop freaking out about my dad’s new girlfriend.  [sighs] This is supposed to be our wedding day.  Why did we invite all these people?     				,6,4,84
Pam,  [smiles] Go ahead.  I think it’s your turn.,6,4,84
Pam, Hey Oscar.  It’s Pam. Hey. We’re on our honeymoon.,6,5,85
Pam," Unless someone very close to us is in immediate physical danger, you should not be calling us.",6,5,85
Pam," Listen our credit card has been cancelled and we have to deal with that, and I really can’t handle the fact that you’re calling us here!",6,5,85
Pam, Oh I will. I will Kevin. I will make that my top priority.,6,5,85
Pam," Oh my gosh. The honeymoon was great. We met this other couple at the resort, Frank and Benny. We hung out with them a lot. ",6,6,86
Pam," Uh, we brought back some Puerto Rican candy. ",6,6,86
Pam, Awesome! I’ll leave it up here so everyone can enjoy it. ,6,6,86
Pam," Frank and beans! [both laugh] So what’d we decide for Michael, the bottle of rum, or the seashell alarm clock?",6,6,86
Pam," Bottle of rum it is. [takes package out of bag] Alright, shall we?",6,6,86
Pam," Wow, Botticelli’s, that sounds like a special occasion. ",6,6,86
Pam, [laughs] I don’t know. I think Michael has a date. ,6,6,86
Pam," Yeah, but I mean, if you really like this person, then you should see where it goes.",6,6,86
Pam," Oh! Gossip, who is it? Who is it? Who is it, Michael? …Who? ",6,6,86
Pam," No, no, no, no, no.  Oh, no. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Nooooo!  				",6,6,86
Pam," [screams out in the parking lot, Michael watches from his office window]",6,6,86
Pam," [outside, on cell phone] How could you do this to me? He’s my boss! How many times have I complained about him to you? No, I am not being dramatic, you are being crazy!",6,6,86
Pam, You need to be more upset about this. She’s your mother too now. Your mother is sleeping with Michael Scott.  				,6,6,86
Pam,"  I have a way to make Scranton a better place, you could leave it.  [laughter]",6,6,86
Pam,"  I love it, conservation.  Let’s start by conserving our time and stop having these stupid meetings.   [stands up and cheers]  No more meetings!  No more meetings! No more meetings!  No more meetings!  [Stanley cheers her on in the background]",6,6,86
Pam,  I’m not apologizing to anyone.  Michael owes me an apology.,6,6,86
Pam,"  Yes!  Thank you, welcome to my personal hell!",6,6,86
Pam,"  Shut up Oscar.  What is wrong with all of you, he is sleeping with my mother!",6,6,86
Pam,"  Whatever, you know, sleep with my mom, sleep with everybody’s mom… ",6,6,86
Pam,"  Uhh, huh, ho… oooh my God, you are ridiculous!",6,6,86
Pam,"  You are never going to be my father, you get out!",6,6,86
Pam,  Hey. [walks up to Oscar and hands him a report to sign],6,6,86
Pam,"  Oh, well, thanks Oscar.  I was just wondering how would you feel if Michael was sleeping with your mom?  ",6,6,86
Pam,"  Well, he could still… I’m sorry about that… Oh could I just get you to sign this second page.    				",6,6,86
Pam,"  [to Michael] What’s the matter, you can’t fight your own battles?  ",6,6,86
Pam,"  [to Michael] Oh, would that make you feel better?  ",6,6,86
Pam,  You can tell Michael that I’m not leaving.,6,6,86
Pam,"  Michael, let me make this very easy for you, I could give a sh[beep] about your happiness!  Stop dating my mother!",6,6,86
Pam,"  [looking out the window at Dwight washing the car]  Awww, he did that for me?  ",6,6,86
Pam, The two people with the lowest sales in the quarter have to do them.  				,6,7,87
Pam, Here it is. [Andy is still singing] Suite 401.,6,7,87
Pam," [Andy shakes his head ‘no’] Oh. No, no. [laughing] We’re not together. No, no, no. Definitely not. Definitely not. No. We just work together.",6,7,87
Pam, And we’d like to offer you 15% off your first purchase as our way of welcoming you to the area.,6,7,87
Pam," Anyway, we also have a special on envelopes.",6,7,87
Pam, You were way meaner to me than I was to you.,6,7,87
Pam, Oh- [both look at each other and together say] Thank you.,6,7,87
Pam, Sometimes we’re so excited we forget where we are. Like at a business meeting.,6,7,87
Pam," If I’m being completely honest, I could’ve done without the belly kiss.",6,7,87
Pam, You’re fantsy involves comparison shopping birthing classes?,6,7,87
Pam," Hey, Erin. Do you mind faxing this for me?",6,7,87
Pam," No. It was a total waste of time. Um… it was fun, though, because I got to spend the day with Andy Bernard. He’s really cool.",6,7,87
Pam, That’s… right. He’s like Marlon Brando.,6,7,87
Pam, I actually do mean Marlon Wayan. Yeah.  				,6,7,87
Pam,"  Michael’s been trying to get Jim and me to hang out ever since he started dating my mom.  I don’t know.  I really hoped this thing would just die out, but today he’s planning a birthday lunch for my mom and we have to go.  No way out.  No way out.  				",6,8,88
Pam, Hey!  [gets up to greet Helene] Hey. Happy birthday.,6,8,88
Pam,  I think you guys all remember my mom from the wedding.,6,8,88
Pam," Yes, let’s go. [looks at Erin and nods]",6,8,88
Pam," Oh, you guys.  Just one second.  [picks up phone] Oh my gosh!  Are you serious?  Shipping emergency.  I don’t think I can go to lunch.",6,8,88
Pam,  I know.  Isn’t that always how it goes?,6,8,88
Pam,  Why did I get in the car?  I could of struggled.  I have a whistle in my purse I didn’t even blow it.    				,6,8,88
Pam,"  I use to love coming here.  The chicken parm is good.  Big part of my childhood.  Oh, maybe Michael will start dating that too.  				",6,8,88
Pam," So, mom… which birthday are we celebrating this year?",6,8,88
Pam, 49 again? That’s nine years in a row.  This is now our longest family tradition.  ,6,8,88
Pam,"  Mom, have you decided what you want to be called?  ",6,8,88
Pam,  He locked himself in his office all morning working on it.    ,6,8,88
Pam,  And then you stopped at the bar on the way back?,6,8,88
Pam," Okay, weirdo.  Come on.  It’s time for cake.  				",6,8,88
Pam,"  I know that it took me a little while to come around and its still a little weird to get used to, but you obviously make my mom very happy.  And that makes me happy.",6,8,88
Pam,  I have the lowest sales record of anyone here.,6,8,88
Pam,  I have the worst attitude of any person here.  ,6,8,88
Pam,  No.  I don’t think I can hit you in the office.  ,6,8,88
Pam,"  So, um… we’ll do it after work.  In the parking lot.  In front of everyone.  I’m going to hit you as hard as I can.",6,8,88
Pam, [stands up; gets into stance] Okay wait– it’s– you’re saying it comes from the foot.,6,8,88
Pam," [goes to punch Michael; he flinches] You have to keep your hands down, Michael.",6,8,88
Pam," Michael, you have to put your hands down.",6,8,88
Pam,  Okay– just– don’t ever date a member of my family again.  ,6,8,88
Pam,"  Michael, he means the Wall Street Journal online.",6,9,89
Pam,"  I’ll go.  [stands up, begins speaking with a southern accent]   My name is Deborah U. Tante.   Deb for short.  ",6,9,89
Pam,  Bill Bourbon was my uncle.  I would have never hurt him any more than I’d hurt a June bug.,6,9,89
Pam,"  Well, which is worse? Snapped or stuck?",6,9,89
Pam,"  Jim, what if we both lose our jobs?  I’m trying to think of a way that this all ends up fine, and I can’t think of one.  				",6,9,89
Pam,  I should just go.  [accent]  Where to now Caleb?,6,9,89
Pam,  [Jim comes out of the office]  What’s the news?,6,9,89
Pam,  [accent] It wasn’t me.  I’m not goin’ down for this!,6,9,89
Pam,"  Get the keys out of my purse, start the car. [Jim and Pam slowly back out of the office, Pam has her weapon trained on everyone and then they run out]  				",6,9,89
Pam," Oh my God, you guys, look. It’s Recyclops.",6,10,90
Pam, The thing I like most about Recyclops is that he’s creating a different world for our child.,6,10,90
Pam, A world where you truly can be anything you want.,6,10,90
Pam, Stuff gets around. I don’t participate.,6,10,90
Pam, I forgot I have to support him no matter what. Close one.  				,6,10,90
Pam," Well, I can’t really imagine you yelling at anyone.",6,10,90
Pam," Oh. Ok. I’ve heard you exclaim. Like the time you said, ‘Hey, look. We parked over here!’.",6,10,90
Pam, Okay. [picks up and reads sheet]  The Michael Scott Foundation is still in existence?,6,11,91
Pam," No Michael, why would you promise that?",6,11,91
Pam," Michael, this is a terrible terrible thing you’ve done.",6,11,91
Pam," Just terrible.  And the longer you put it off, the worse it’s going to get.  				",6,11,91
Pam," It’s fine.  Erin, you’re going to go.  And you’re going to make sure Michael tells the truth.",6,11,91
Pam,"  Ok, for the record, I am pregnant and, obviously there has been some kind of a mistake, so why doesn’t Jim just pick the next highest score on the list and we’ll move on.",6,11,91
Pam," No, wait, come on.  I didn’t miss a day, I came in early, I stayed late, and I doubled my sales last month.",6,11,91
Pam," So Santa, what can we expect from this party?",6,12,92
Pam," You know Oscar every time I make this lasagna people ask me if it’s a family recipe, but really, I just get the recipe from the box!",6,12,92
Pam," Is it funny? I thought it was more …interesting, than funny. [she walks over to see Oscar at the window looking down on man catching a football in parking lot]  I think my water just broke!",6,12,92
Pam, Oscar and the warehouse guy! Go Oscar! Go gay warehouse guy!  ,6,12,92
Pam," Michael, we already have a Santa, Phyllis.",6,12,92
Pam," Mmm! Good pate, right? [Matt nods yes] Oscar made it. Have you met Oscar?  ",6,12,92
Pam," Hey, Oscar, come here. Oscar, this is Matt, and um, Matt loves your pate.",6,12,92
Pam," Oscar’s pate is great. I could eat it all day, every day. Mmm. How come the good ones are never straight, right?",6,12,92
Pam, Yes! They’re the only two gay guys I know. But they should be together.  ,6,12,92
Pam," Twelve drummers drumming. [marching drum band lines up to perform, Andy steps out with cymbals]",6,12,92
Pam," It might seem crazy, but since there’s no one left in New York, Michael is Dunder Mifflin’s highest ranking employee. So, that’s where we are.  				",6,13,93
Pam," For the record? Not on board with fake Stanley… although, I get it.  				",6,13,93
Pam," Well, maybe we can put the box back together.",6,14,94
Pam," [Pam and Oscar are trying to repack cardboard box] Yep, yep.",6,14,94
Pam, Because we’re usually not on the same page.,6,14,94
Pam," Oh, you mapquested it. It’s four blocks away. ",6,14,94
Pam, We found a great local daycare. It’s rated really high by all the local parenting websites. But that means it’s also really hard to get into.,6,14,94
Pam, We’re hoping our interview seals the deal.,6,14,94
Pam, There’s a finger-painting station and a curly slide. Am I too old to go here?,6,14,94
Pam, He’s uncomfortable because you’re acting weird. So you have to stop acting weird.,6,14,94
Pam, That’s the weirdest possible solution to the problem.,6,14,94
Pam, Is this because Jim walked in on you going to the bathroom? ,6,14,94
Pam," Maybe, because it doesn’t seem to be going super well.",6,14,94
Pam, Nope. ‘Cause we’re really nice people but you don’t seem to like us. ,6,14,94
Pam," So, check this out. According to the handbook, you could make more money as a salesman than as a manager. They have all these incentive programs. I ran your numbers from last year.",6,15,95
Pam," [pointing to the window in Michael’s office] Oh, Michael marked his heights. He’s grown!",6,15,95
Pam, [gesturing to Michael dancing in his office] He looks happy.,6,15,95
Pam,  There is nothing dishonorable about talking about your life.  People like it.,6,16,96
Pam,"  Mmmm, that sounds great.  What are you thinking?",6,16,96
Pam,"  I’m having contractions, but they’re irregular and far apart.  So I’m not really in labor, I’m near labor.",6,16,96
Pam,"  If we check in after midnight, I get an extra day to recuperate surrounded by doctors.",6,16,96
Pam,  I cannot wait for that joke to be over.  				,6,16,96
Pam,"  You know the baby’s not going to live here, right?",6,16,96
Pam,"  Okay, okay, we’re not going to the hospital.  We are waiting until midnight.",6,16,96
Pam,  Everything’s fine.  We have plenty of time.,6,16,96
Pam,"  Hold on, hold on.  It isn’t midnight yet.",6,16,96
Pam,"  No, the doctor said every five to seven minutes.",6,16,96
Pam,"  I’m going to be okay, we should really try to make it until midnight.",6,16,96
Pam,"  Actually, the distractions are good.  I mean, I don’t think I’m going to make it until midnight if I’m just sitting here thinking about it.",6,16,96
Pam,"  Oh, okay, uh, sorry, guys.  Just, um, keep talking.",6,16,96
Pam,"  Yes, this is the only time I’m ever going to make this request.",6,16,96
Pam,"  Jim, please.  Happy thoughts here.  Happy times.",6,16,96
Pam,"  Jim, Jim, honey, I love you, but you’re really distracting me from my distractions.",6,16,96
Pam,"  I know, you don’t like to be frazzled.",6,16,96
Pam,"  Hey.  I’m not going to get in the car, because I know if I do you’ll try to drive me to the hospital.",6,16,96
Pam,"  Everything is fine.  You don’t have to worry.  Try not to think about it.  She’s not coming out for a while, okay?",6,16,96
Pam,"  I called the doctor like a week ago.  I couldn’t wait…  Oh, God, don’t be mad.",6,16,96
Pam,"  [enters the office and has another contraction]  Oh, whoa.  Ha.  Wow.",6,16,96
Pam,"  Oh, wow, it’s almost time for ultra feast!  Where’s Kevin?",6,16,96
Pam,"  There is no rush to get to the hospital.  I am fine.  I’ll get there.  And if I don’t get there, I don’t get there.  				",6,16,96
Pam,"  Mm-hmm.  Yes, I’m fine.  Um, yeah, the doctor said it’s still considered a minor contraction as long as I can talk through it.",6,16,96
Pam,"  Nope.  No, no, that’s better.  That wasn’t even the worst of them.  I’m fine.",6,16,96
Pam,"  No, it’s passing, it’s fine.  It’s okay.  ",6,16,96
Pam,"  Okay, I’m not going.  I’m not…  It’s fine.   [Jim, Michael and Kevin try to help her up] Okay, come on, come on.  No!  I am not going!  I am not going, okay!?  I’m not going today because I can’t do it, I don’t think I can do it.",6,16,96
Pam,"  Stop texting, put your phone away!  Come on.",6,16,96
Pam,"  Jim, I don’t want the first thing the baby hears to be the 8 Mile soundtrack.",6,16,96
Pam,  I don’t know!  Let’s go by the house and get it.  It’s only twenty minutes past the hospital!,6,16,96
Pam,  Dwight!  Go to my house.  Get my iPod.  I think it’s on the kitchen table.  Do not touch anything else.  The key is under…,6,16,96
Pam,"  Okay, Dwight, but if you do need a key, just listen it’s under the…",6,16,96
Pam,  Dwight just listen!  It’s underneath…  [Dwight hangs up as the policeman hands him a ticket]  				,6,16,96
Pam,"  [with Jim, holding the baby]  She’s incredible.  Want to count her fingers and toes again?",6,16,96
Pam,"  Oh, thank God.  I haven’t had caffeine in nine months.",6,16,96
Pam,"  Okay, you just have to use the hand sanitizer first.",6,16,96
Pam,  Remember yesterday when we were terrified of being parents?,6,16,96
Pam,"  [as the baby yawns]  Oh, big yawn.  				",6,16,96
Pam,"  One, and then wrap around.  It’s okay.  Hold that arm down.",6,16,96
Pam,"  I don’t know.  I just, I can’t tell if she’s getting anything.",6,16,96
Pam,  I can’t tell if she’s getting anything.  It just doesn’t really feel right.  ,6,16,96
Pam,  No.  I read in the book about nipple confusion.,6,16,96
Pam,"  She’s just, she’s really tentative about latching, and I just, I want to keep her self-esteem up.",6,16,96
Pam,  Maybe it’ll be good because then she can like socialize with the other babies.,6,16,96
Pam,"  So, uh, biggest thing, besides not being able to get her to latch…",6,16,96
Pam,"  Oh, thank you.  Is that um, I can’t tell if I’m really producing.  I don’t know if she’s getting anything.",6,16,96
Pam,"  Okay.  So, I’m just not sure if I’m releasing, though.  I’m not sure if…",6,16,96
Pam,"  Will you just, will you grab Clark real quick?",6,16,96
Pam,"  Um, Jim, please, please, please, I think it’d be weird if you did it.",6,16,96
Pam,"  [trying to sleep as the baby cries]  Jim, Jim, get her.",6,16,96
Pam,  I got her.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay…  Jim!  She latched!  She latched.  ,6,16,96
Pam,"  Oh, my God.  I didn’t even have to do the “C thing.”",6,16,96
Pam,"  Yes.  She was a little fussy earlier, but she’s totally quieted down.  Here, let me just, uh, let me just burp her.  I don’t want her to spit up on you.  Come here, sweety…  Oh, my God!  Wrong baby!",6,16,96
Pam,  Wrong baby!  This is not our baby!  Sshh.,6,16,96
Pam,"  Well, I feel like she needs to eat, but she won’t latch on, which is weird, because the other baby di…",6,16,96
Pam,"  Okay, alright, thanks…  Okay, do you want to eat?  You want to try eating?  Okay…  Okay, let me…  Just you and me.  Come on.  There we go…  Yeah…  Oh, yeah.  Like that.  There we go.  You got it.",6,16,96
Pam,  I used a variation of your move.  				,6,16,96
Pam," It’s kind of like that lip thing she did last night, like a half snarl, half smile? I get the sense that she’s very ironic.",6,17,97
Pam, Nothing but vomit and diapers over here.,6,18,98
Pam," He means his mopey place, it’s under that streetlamp that he thinks was in Casablanca. ",6,18,98
Pam,"[through phone] It’s been so long since I’ve been with adults. I am so excited to see everybody. Creed, Ryan. Oh my God, Stanley! Stanley’s going to be there. Yes, oh my God!",6,19,99
Pam,"They’re both single, I have a sense they might-",6,19,99
Pam,"Hey, Isabel, you made it. Oh, my goodness.",6,19,99
Pam,"Hey, Michael, where have you been? [Michael shoots pool ball up into their faces]",6,19,99
Pam,"Hey, Michael, why don’t you just get down.",6,19,99
Pam,"Ok, um, why don’t we just finish the game? Michael, it’s your shot.",6,19,99
Pam,Do you guys want some food? The wings are really good here.  				,6,19,99
Pam," It’s my first day back after maternity leave. And I miss Cece, of course. But we need the money. What was maternity leave like? Oh, how do I explain it?… It rocked. It rocked my ass off.   				",6,20,100
Pam," [at her desk, grabs her plant and sees it dried up, looks at Jim] Oh. You couldn’t have watered it?",6,20,100
Pam, [feels a pain in her breast] Ooh. Ah-ah-ah. Ha-ha. ,6,20,100
Pam," That’s weird, my breast pump is missing. Have you seen my breast pump? ",6,20,100
Pam," You know what, Dwight? Let me just check the bathroom first. Okay?",6,20,100
Pam," Mm. [walks into bathroom, Meredith is using her brest pump] Meredith!",6,20,100
Pam," [imitating Cookie Monster] “Hey, Erin, You look delicious. I mean, beautiful.”",6,20,100
Pam, Hey. You know I was engaged before Jim.,6,20,100
Pam," No, no it wasn’t Andy. It wasn’t. It doesn’t matter. It’s not about who you’ve been with. It’s about who you end up with. Sometimes the heart doesn’t know what it wants until it finds what it wants.",6,20,100
Pam, Thank you. [kisses Jim on the cheek]  				,6,20,100
Pam, I don’t think an apology is enough. I really think the only way for me to learn my lesson is to take my suspension. ,6,20,100
Pam," You know, maybe there’s an opportunity for a joke there, like, um… like, [vaudeville delivery] “I just delivered a baby. They didn’t offer me a guarantee.”",6,21,101
Pam, This is our first joint sales pitch. I think we’re gonna work really well together. ,6,21,101
Pam," We have good give and take. [vaudeville delivery] I give, he takes. ",6,21,101
Pam," Oh, no we’re actually married. We’re not brother and sister. ",6,21,101
Pam," Maybe Michael has a point. I mean, if she was really that upset, she wouldn’t still be here.   				",6,21,101
Pam, What if I back out and you finish the pitch with Jim?,6,21,101
Pam, Just let him flirt with her. People meet each other all sorts of ways.,6,21,101
Pam, Who cares? [Michael peeking at them through his office window] It’s not that huge a sale. ,6,21,101
Pam," Don’t act like you understood anything that guy said. [pat’s Jim’s arm] Good luck, wingman. [salutes]  				",6,21,101
Pam, Maybe she’s just pushing her breasts together to make them look bigger. ,6,21,101
Pam, You can flirt with someone to get what you want and also be attracted to them. How do you think we got together?,6,21,101
Pam," Um… I think it’s really, really unlikely. ",6,21,101
Pam, Really unlikely. But I can’t say that it’s impossible. ,6,21,101
Pam," I’m not saying she’s in love with him. But she could have left a while ago. Most printer sales are done over the phone, Ms. Boob shirt.   				",6,21,101
Pam," Hey, Michael. [Michael is sitting on couch outside his office] How you doing? ",6,21,101
Pam," You know what, Michael? For what it’s worth… I was wrong, too. I thought she was interested in you. ",6,21,101
Pam, She doesn’t want you to return the barrette. She’s not interested in you.,6,21,101
Pam," It all started when Dwight was tapping his foot against the leg of his desk. When I asked him to stop, he said, “I will when you lose the baby weight.”   				",6,22,102
Pam, You had a nice meal with your girlfriend in a lovely place… ,6,22,102
Pam, That is right. Don’t make any more of it.,6,22,102
Pam, You could start by concluding this meeting.,6,22,102
Pam," Michael, do not let your imagination run amok. ",6,22,102
Pam," Amok. It means, don’t let your imagination run out of control. ",6,22,102
Pam," Michael, do not let your imagination run out of control. ",6,22,102
Pam, Why do we have to see what Dwight says?,6,22,102
Pam," Michael. Okay, I’m… I’m going to talk straight to you because I think you need to hear it. Michael.",6,22,102
Pam, Stop eating it! Do you wanna be happy? Look at you. You have a major self-destructive streak in you. ,6,22,102
Pam, And you kind of torpedo every romantic relationship you’re in. ,6,22,102
Pam," My mother, Helene. [Jim shakes his head]",6,22,102
Pam," Okay, heart-shaped jewelry is not something that a woman buys for herself. A man definitely bought it for her recently, and it wasn’t Michael. ",6,22,102
Pam, No. Except for the pendant that you bought me. Which I love.  				,6,22,102
Pam," So it turns out Donna and I have a facebook friend of a friend in common, so I was able to see some of her pictures online. [pulls out picture of Donna embracing a man and smiling] This was taken two weeks ago. And this was taken the same night. [pulls out a picture of Donna kissing the same man] This photo was taken this morning. [shows a baby picture] It’s Cece. [laughs] She’s never gonna do anything wrong.   				",6,22,102
Pam," I’m sorry to interrupt you. Um, I actually have something very important to talk to you about, business related. ",6,22,102
Pam, I lied it’s personal. It’s about me and Jim. We’re… I just… you’re the only person I can talk to. ,6,22,102
Pam," No, not… we’re not… we’re not having problems. But it is personal. And I would love… ",6,22,102
Pam," Yes. Yes, I desperately want to speak with you about my sex life with Jim.",6,22,102
Pam, [loudly] I need you to sign this! So bad!,6,22,102
Pam, I love [leans over Michael’s desk to look at his computer screen]… this idea is neat. I’ve never been. It sounds lovely. [meanwhile Michael looks at the pictures Pam printed out],6,22,102
Pam," [to Michael] You’re gonna wanna look at the date on that.  Oh, wow. Look at… golfing. [to Donna] Are you a golfer?",6,22,102
Pam, Absolutely. [both leave Michael’s office]  				,6,22,102
Pam, You just have to go in there. You have to hear it from her.,6,22,102
Pam," Okay. Look at this, look at this. Baby picture. ",6,22,102
Pam," [in baby voice] Hi, Michael, hi, Michael",6,22,102
Pam,  [reading flavors] Despera-dough. Witchy-womanilla. Why do they do this?,6,23,103
Pam,"  No, no, no, it’s fine. I was just commenting. We gotta get these out, open ’em up.  				",6,23,103
Pam,"  Yeah, and when Michael gets a broken heart, this whole place comes to a halt, so we’re just trying to get out in front of this.",6,23,103
Pam,"  [yawns] Yeah, or no… well… I don’t know. I’m sorry. I was up all night with Cece, otherwise I’d be running this.",6,23,103
Pam,"  And we need bodies in both these rooms, people. So please sign up.",6,23,103
Pam,"  Oh, okay. Everyone, remember, when he get’s like this, he will wallow, if you empathize. Keep conversations light and if you get stuck, and you don’t know what to do, make a random sound effect okay? Farting noise, whatever. Okay.",6,23,103
Pam,"  Oh, and if he makes a joke, just laugh it up, no matter what. Okay?",6,23,103
Pam,  That’s awesome. You want some ice cream?,6,23,103
Pam,"  We were wondering if you would like to have dinner with us tonight, in our home, and play with our baby.",6,23,103
Pam,  We can watch a movie and play Rock Band.,6,23,103
Pam,"  [shouts] Michael Scott, are you still seeing Donna?",6,23,103
Pam,  I don’t think those were yours to take. ,6,23,103
Pam,  You talked to the man whose wife you’re having an affair with. ,6,23,103
Pam,"  [shakes head] It gets in the breast milk. If I drink it, Cece drinks it six hours later.",6,23,103
Pam, Okay. I’m talking to this woman at daycare…,6,24,104
Pam," She’s telling me about all her amazing trip to Vietnam, I have nothing. I tell her our printers catch on fire, spontaneously!",6,24,104
Pam," So now everyone hates Andy, and it’s this whole mess, and I don’t know what to do.",6,24,104
Pam, I could tell Jo… or I could tell Michael.,6,24,104
Pam," I don’t know what to do! Do I go tell Jo, or – I don’t want everyone to keep blaming the wrong person!",6,24,104
Pam," [Michael knocks on Pam’s desk] Yeah? [Michael points at Pam, himself, and Meredith, mimes drinking, driving, then points to his watch and holds up five fingers] I weirdly know exactly what you’re saying to me.",6,24,104
Pam," Yeah, you didn’t need to actually say it.  				",6,24,104
Pam, [in Meredith’s van] I have never seen so many parking tickets.,6,24,104
Pam, Wouldn’t we get fired for smashing all the computers?,6,24,104
Pam," Nobody’s going to prison, okay? Um… all right, Michael, you need to convince Jo to go easy on us. And then we’ll all confess once we know our jobs are safe.",6,24,104
Pam, [goes to change thermostat as Dwight puts a locked cover over it] Hey. What are you doing?,7,1,106
Pam, Why is there a circle with a line through it?,7,1,106
Pam, I don’t know. That usually works.  				,7,1,106
Pam," I feel horrible for blowing Jim’s prank. I don’t know if you can tell, but he’s mildly upset. And Dwight hasn’t been messed with in a while, so he’s become a monster. I need to make this right.   				",7,1,106
Pam," Yeah, yeah. Like when he presses “Doors closed” the doors open. Or he presses “lobby” it goes to third floor, stuff like that. Can you do that? ",7,1,106
Pam," Yeah, I wanted to show you something in the lobby. Come on.",7,1,106
Pam," Dwight, what are you doing!? We’ve only been in here for, like, two seconds!",7,1,106
Pam," Oh, hey Jim. Some prankster switched the elevator buttons on Dwight. ",7,1,106
Pam," I know. Yeah, and it was going really great at first. I got video.",7,1,106
Pam," Well, you know… they don’t call me the Bart Simpson of Scranton for nothing. ",7,1,106
Pam," Nope. Scared of getting cut in half. Also, there’s pee on the floor.",7,1,106
Pam,"  [on phone] Look, I’m not going to tell you that we have lower prices. Is price something that is important to you? Ok, well let me know if anything changes. ",7,2,107
Pam,"  I can’t do this. I don’t have this sales gene, or whatever it is. Tell me everything is going to be ok.",7,2,107
Pam,"  The unfair thing about working in sales is that your salary is almost all commission. So, you suck at sales, you make almost no money. I guess that’s fair.  				",7,2,107
Pam,  [hesitates] I am. I am the office administrator! ,7,2,107
Pam,"  Oh, we’re not interested. We’re not interested at all.   				",7,2,107
Pam,  There are a few ways to get promoted. One is to wait for an opening and apply for it. That’s the main way. But this could work.  				,7,2,107
Pam,"  A few months ago. I was talking to someone at corporate, who isn’t there anymore, and I think the paperwork just got lost in the shuffle. Can you believe that? ",7,2,107
Pam,"  Thanks! Yeah, so I’m just going to take care of things around the office and get paid a reasonable salary. You believe that, right?",7,2,107
Pam,"  No, not $50,000, $41,000, I think. $41,500.",7,2,107
Pam,"  Well, as I am sure you know, for the past few months, I’ve been the Office Administrator. Since right before you guys took over. ",7,2,107
Pam,"  And, I haven’t gotten paid yet. I’m not blaming you.",7,2,107
Pam,  I just think somebody lost the paperwork. ,7,2,107
Pam,"  Hey Michael, um… about three months ago, I was talking to… [Michael grabs form and signs it without reading.]  				",7,2,107
Pam,"  There are a lot of one person departments here, so, there’s a lot of department heads. But I’m off to a good start. Oh, man! If I could pull this off, it will be scam of all scams. And yet very helpful to everyone.   				",7,2,107
Pam,"  Although, like, unlikely things happen all the time. My best friend, in High School, she went to Australia, Canberra I think, and she met this guy who lived only two streets away in America. ",7,2,107
Pam,"  Say that I’m lying or say that I have the job. Make a definitive statement, Gabe.",7,2,107
Pam,"  Great. Well, Let me know if you need a new chair, or anything that an Office Administrator can handle. ",7,2,107
Pam,"  The first lesson of watching World Poker Tour at 2:00 AM, you play the opponent. Not the cards.   				",7,2,107
Pam," Oh, we wanted to, but our sitter just fell through. I’m really sorry. ",7,3,108
Pam," I mean, who knows? Maybe I have a niece my family never told me about.",7,3,108
Pam," Hey, Erin, it’s Pam. How ya doing? No, no, don’t put Cece on the phone, because she can’t talk yet. Okay. No, I was just calling to see how everything’s going. Yeah? Yeah? It’s good? The play? The play is kind of great. I mean, it’s fun to hear Andy sing in the appropriate setting. Now, he’s really sorry you couldn’t make it, too. Yeah. So thank you so much, again. We’re having a great time. Oh, they’re flashing the lights so we should go in. Thanks. Bye. Okay, so we called. And everything’s fine!",7,3,108
Pam," [sees Erin holding Cece] Oh, my God! Go, go!",7,3,108
Pam," What possible explanation could you have for possibly being here? I don’t… you know, babies shouldn’t have ice cream, by the way. ",7,3,108
Pam, You know what? It doesn’t matter. It doesn’t matter. ,7,3,108
Pam, No. No no no! [nos coming from all employees],7,4,109
Pam," [Nate starts walking away from hornet’s nest, puts down the blowtorch] Yes!",7,4,109
Pam," What? No! Wait, no. Definitely not cancer.  				",7,4,109
Pam, It’s just good to stop a Michael train of thought early before it derails and destroys the entire town.  				,7,4,109
Pam," Wait! What you should do, Michael, is have a doctor take a look at it. Because we really don’t know what that is.",7,4,109
Pam, Hey! Our baby was not a mistake. She was a surprise.,7,4,109
Pam, Andy that’s way too personal of a question.,7,4,109
Pam, Nothing happened. We went on a couple of dates. He never called me again.,7,5,110
Pam," That’s fizzling. I mean, someone has to start the fizzle.",7,5,110
Pam," No, I liked him. For a couple of days. Four years ago. [Jim nodding repeatedly] You know I have a kid with you, right?",7,5,110
Pam," You don’t look reluctant, Michael. You look really eager.",7,5,110
Pam, Not really. It’s kinda weird that a grown man is singing from the point of view of a little girl.,7,5,110
Pam," [turns around, is wearing a mustache] Bye, Stanley! Love you! [waves, Stanley leaves]",7,6,111
Pam," People are really into the costume contest this year. Might have something to do with the prize, maybe you’ve heard of it. The 2011 Scranton Wilkes-Barre coupon book worth over fifteen thousand dollars in savings!  				",7,6,111
Pam," I’m supposed to be Olive Oyl. And it makes more sense when I’m standing next to Popeye, but… Jim doesn’t want to put his costume on.",7,6,111
Pam, Except where Juliet doesn’t have that great a time and Romeo doesn’t call back after two dates.,7,6,111
Pam, But I’ve learned to love again. [puts her arm on Jim’s shoulder] He’s a cartoon sailor.,7,6,111
Pam, And looks so handsome in his UNIFORM! Please?,7,6,111
Pam," [leans over toward Erin] Um, hit the speakerphone button. The speakerphone button? The same button as you hit before… or sit on it.",7,6,111
Pam," Oh, my gosh! People keep blowing it out of proportion! It’s not even a history.",7,6,111
Pam," No, we um, we had plans for a third, but then I don’t know, you never called me back, so…",7,6,111
Pam," Yeah? [stops laughing] It was though, that’s what happened. ",7,6,111
Pam," Okay, everybody! After you walk the runway everyone has to vote for who gets the coupon book. And you can’t vote for yourself.",7,6,111
Pam," Dressing up as somebody-I mean, when has that ever worked for you?",7,6,111
Pam, I’d remember talking about Jim. That wasn’t it.,7,6,111
Pam," I did. And it’s just one of those things that’s going to keep gnawing at me, like “gnaw, gnaw, why? Why didn’t he? I have no idea why.”",7,6,111
Pam," Thank you! Thank you. I got it. Now I know. You thought I was a little dorky. You know? [gibberish sounds] Okay. Well, excuuuuse me.  				",7,6,111
Pam," Okay, everyone, I’ve tallied the votes, and the winner… of the costume celebration spectacular… and the Scranton Wilkes-Barre coupon book… Oscar Martinez.   				",7,6,111
Pam, One of the simplest ways to cut down on the spread of germs is to use something called the vampire cough.,7,7,112
Pam," Oh, no, it’s just that if a vampire had to cough, he would do it like this. [coughs into elbow]",7,7,112
Pam," Well, other things you can do to help cut down on the spread of disease are to wash your hands regularly. Don’t come in if you’re sick.",7,7,112
Pam," And get your flu shot. Also, I’m going to set up hand sanitizing stations around the office.",7,7,112
Pam, I’m not – I’m not going to do that. I’m not going to do that.,7,7,112
Pam, Everyone from work is here. We weren’t planning on that.,7,7,112
Pam," Okay, Michael. Um, you know I love when you do that voice, but today, I’m so sorry. I need you to tell me that you know you’re not Cece’s godfather.",7,7,112
Pam," I’m sorry, Michael. I need you to say it. I’m so sorry.",7,7,112
Pam," No, I met his wife in Mommy and Me. They’re a great couple. You should meet them later.",7,7,112
Pam," Okay. Thank you for coming, Michael.  				",7,7,112
Pam, [looking at Cece’s diaper] Somebody needs a change.,7,7,112
Pam," Well, she can’t bring this up with her.",7,7,112
Pam, [seeing Jim come in with Cece wearing an old t-shirt] What?,7,7,112
Pam, We just had to add a few more tables. We weren’t expecting this many people.,7,7,112
Pam," Nope, and we’re gonna need a loaves and fishes kind of miracle to feed ’em all.",7,7,112
Pam, [to Cece] Hm. Don’t listen to her. She’s just jealous ’cause she doesn’t get to come home to someone as cute as you.,7,7,112
Pam," Well, if it makes you feel better, I didn’t get one either.",7,7,112
Pam, We need more food. I’ll go get some subs and sodas.,7,7,112
Pam," Cece, is reverse cycling, which means she sleeps all day and is up all night. Which basically means I’m up all day and I’m up all night. And if it doesn’t stop soon, I am going to be up all night.  				",7,8,113
Pam, [enters on Michael alone sitting on a bed watching Glee] Michael? Maybe you should try gong in the other room again. You can have my seat. It’s closer to the TV. It’ll seem louder.,7,8,113
Pam, If I could get her sleeping normally I could get my life back.,7,8,113
Pam," Look, I know what you have to do, please stay with Cece. Dwight? I’ve always considered for us to be very good friends. Great friends! Remember your concussion?",7,8,113
Pam," Jim, just don’t think of it as degrading. Think of it as, you happen to be moving the six inches his way and he happens to be biting it.",7,8,113
Pam," What no, wait! You said you were gonna help us!",7,8,113
Pam, Okay fine! There must be some way to get out of it. Even just for tonight!,7,8,113
Pam," No no no, don’t. I will go talk to Angela.",7,8,113
Pam, The reverse cycling ends tonight! [Pam leaves],7,8,113
Pam," [knocking on Angela’s car window, Angela is naked inside] Hey in there. It’s Pam. It’s not Dwight! Don’t think it’s Dwight!",7,8,113
Pam," I know you and Dwight have this weird deal, uhm, he sent me out here to see if you could postpone.",7,8,113
Pam," You know, there are a lot of guys out there who would just love and appreciate a-",7,8,113
Pam," Wait, um, does anyone remember when it was set up? ",7,9,114
Pam," Lord of the Ring stuff? I don’t know, I’m just trying to think of things that were happening at the time.",7,9,114
Pam," Yes, I invested in WUPHF. It’s actually a great idea and I can’t believe it didn’t exist before. And I know Ryan’s kind of a sketchy guy, but hey, I married Jim. I’ve done my part for the nice guy. Now I want a bedroom set.   ",7,9,114
Pam," I love you, but I’m kinda busy. So I need you to figure this one out on your own.",7,9,114
Pam, Oscar said WUPHF only has enough money for nine days.,7,9,114
Pam," Michael, I… [sits down] I hate to say this, but… you know this special bond that you’ve always felt with Ryan, where, like, you’re best friends or you’re his mentor or something?",7,9,114
Pam," Michael, I think that feeling only goes one way. And I think that Ryan knows that, and he’s taking advantage of you.",7,9,114
Pam, And there are a lot of other people in this office who have money at stake. Other people you care about.,7,9,114
Pam," Yeah, but in a jokey way where you’re gonna start singing.",7,9,114
Pam," Umm, Stanley. Maybe you could just unspool a little more each time you need to…",7,10,115
Pam," Dwight, can we talk about these cutbacks.",7,10,115
Pam," Hey, I would just love to schedule a meeting today with Dwight.",7,10,115
Pam," [hangs up phone] Dwight. Dwight. Can you please tell new building owner that he is screwing over all the people he works with, people he’s worked with for years. His friends.",7,10,115
Pam," So, does anyone wanna know where I’ve been for the last 2 hours?",7,10,115
Pam, I went out to look for a better office space.,7,10,115
Pam," Look at the huge offices Jim, check out that conference room.",7,10,115
Pam," Oh in three months we can. Check the lease, and if you don’t undo all the changes you’ve made, we’re moving. Hey guys, can I show you some pictures.",7,10,115
Pam, This is possibly our new Dunder Mifflin office.,7,10,115
Pam," Well, this building isn’t far, and its much newer. There’s a dry cleaner, nail place and a gym. Oh, and it’s next-door to and Outback so it always smells like steak.",7,10,115
Pam, We need everything back the way it was.,7,10,115
Pam," That’s a sad story. I have another one. We move, the other tenants follow, the bank takes the building, takes your farm, takes your car and beats the crap out of you. Penniless, you die, and my daughter Cece dances on your grave… fully clothed. [lights turn off, Pam and Dwight begin to wave their arms to alert the sensor]  				",7,10,115
Pam," I know, because you’re the reason we’re moving.",7,10,115
Pam," Oh, actually I don’t know what I did with the one sheet. Y’know, that’s the problem. You only have one sheet.",7,10,115
Pam, I lied about some aspects of the building.,7,10,115
Pam," I needed leverage so I pulled those pictures off the internet. It’s just this Office Administrator thing, I don’t wanna…",7,10,115
Pam," And that’s what you said about Art School, and that’s what you said about sales.",7,10,115
Pam," Well, I’m not an artist, and I’m not a salesman. So what would you call it?",7,10,115
Pam," Read article nineteen. There are suitable standards that you have to maintain the building at that includes comfortable temperatures and adequate lighting. It also means no more cutting the tampons in two, and no more tampering with the toilet paper. ",7,10,115
Pam," Okay, this is just a Christmas card from your paper supplier. No one’s putting this on their fridge.",7,11,116
Pam," I’m the office administrator now, which means I’m basically being paid to be head of the party planning committee. The first thing I did as head… I shut it down. At its best it was a toxic political club used to make others feel miserable and left out. At its best it planned parties.  				",7,11,116
Pam," Before we kick off the party, I just want to remind everyone that an office party is just that…",7,11,116
Pam, A party. It’s not an excuse to get really drunk or confront someone or have a cathartic experience of any kind.,7,11,116
Pam," Wow, there are, there are questions to that. Okay. Um, you know what, no questions. Last item on the agenda, Toby would like to make an announcement.",7,11,116
Pam," Michael, Michael, wait we don’t have, we don’t have the budget for another party.",7,11,116
Pam," I honestly think you’re idealizing people here again, Michael. I don’t think that’s gonna happen.",7,11,116
Pam," Yes. But don’t get too excited, ’cause I didn’t have a lot of time this year.",7,11,116
Pam," I’ve been working forever on Jim’s present. He always gives me the best Christmas gifts. He’ll take a memory or a private joke, and he’ll create something totally unique. I love them. So this year I made him something. A comic book. It stars Jimmy Halpert, a mild-mannered paper Salesman who, while riding his bike through the forest, is bitten by a radioactive bear, becomes ‘bear man’. Wreaks havoc on the office. It’s really good.  				",7,11,116
Pam," Hey, uh, any volunteers to come with me to go buy a Christmas tree?",7,11,116
Pam, Why do you always think that girls are gonna be at the party? No one invited girls. It’s just us.,7,11,116
Pam," Oh, do you mean Darryl? That’s a great idea. I’ll ask him.",7,11,116
Pam," Hey, sorry, I really didn’t want to come in. It’s just that we have to go buy a new Christmas tree, and we’re hoping we could borrow your truck.",7,11,116
Pam," Okay. Sorry. We’ll uh, we’ll leave you alone.",7,11,116
Pam," Um, hey, Darryl, listen, it’s none of my business, but if I couldn’t have Cece for Christmas, I’d be really upset too.",7,11,116
Pam," Well Darryl, no kid wants to buy their own Christmas presents.",7,11,116
Pam," No, you should have her mom do the boring Christmas stuff on her time. You should be associated with the fun parts of Christmas.",7,11,116
Pam," Bring her to the party. Yeah, we’ll have Santa, and we’ll play games with her. It’ll be a lot of fun.",7,11,116
Pam, You’ll be Mr. Christmas by the end of the night.  				,7,11,116
Pam," Kelly! Um, how are you adjusting to the move?",7,11,116
Pam," You guys, I don’t think any of us are really qualified to be giving Holly personal advice about her love life.",7,11,116
Pam," Okay, well, I just sorta meant, like, cute, right?",7,11,116
Pam," I mean, help, if it’s something simple, like add page numbers or laminate it or…",7,11,116
Pam," No, no. Jim had a great year, actually. I just wanted to get your opinion.",7,11,116
Pam," Jada, Darryl, I’m so glad I found you guys. A grinch stole the star from on top of the Christmas tree and is hiding it in the warehouse somewhere. You want to go help me find him?  				",7,11,116
Pam," Something like an obstacle course, Mr. Grinch?",7,11,116
Pam," [Jim hits a ceiling panel] I don’t think he’s in the ceiling, babe.",7,11,116
Pam, Is it… is it pebbles from that beach in Jamaica? [she shakes it],7,11,116
Pam," [lifting up a diamond bracelet] Oh, my God.",7,11,116
Pam," Oh, um, it’s just, I didn’t, I didn’t have a lot of time, so that’s just a place holder.",7,11,116
Pam," Oh, okay, Michael, slow down. Everything’s gonna be okay. ",7,11,116
Pam," I shouldn’t tell you this, but… AJ won’t commit to Holly. And she’s gonna tell him that if he doesn’t propose to her by the end of the year, it’s over.",7,11,116
Pam," Really. And I don’t know about you, but I don’t know of a lot of happy marriages that start off with an ultimatum, do you?",7,11,116
Pam," Oh… come on, bear man. Come on. [the lights flicker]",7,11,116
Pam," Oh, my God. Oh, my God. No, no, no, no.",7,11,116
Pam," What? What is it? What? What is, oh, my God! [Jim starts attacking snowmen] Honey? Jim? Jim!  				",7,11,116
Pam," Hey, guys! Fun thing. The index cards on your desk are resolution cards. You write your New Year’s resolution on them, I’ll collect them, and then display them on… da-da-da-da-da! This! Resolution board.",7,12,117
Pam," I recently met Sue, the office administrator at Vance Refrigeration. She has this awesome wall full of fun initiatives and morale boosters and stuff. Sue just goes for it, she’s awesome.   				",7,12,117
Pam," Oh, hey, guys! I’d like to introduce you to a new little friend of mine.  His name is New Year’s resolution board. ",7,12,117
Pam," Hey, Dwight, I’m collecting resolution cards.",7,12,117
Pam, The goal of this meeting is to get everybody excited about their resolutions! Who’s been good about their resolutions so far? Erin. Tell us about it.,7,12,117
Pam, Cool! Here’s a little ‘way to go’ gift from Sabre. [tosses Erin a Frisbee],7,12,117
Pam, Creed. I noticed you don’t have a resolution on the board. What’s yours?,7,12,117
Pam," One of the hardest parts about making resolutions is keeping them. In fact, most resolutions are abandoned by February. ",7,12,117
Pam," But that’s okay. Because it’s not about being perfect, it’s about trying.  In fact, why don’t we go around and confess some of the ways that we’ve fudged on some of our resolutions?",7,12,117
Pam," Okay, well, my confession is that today I had a sip of coffee. But that’s fine.",7,12,117
Pam," Yes! Because with all of your support, by this time next year maybe I’ll be down to one glass of iced tea a week.",7,12,117
Pam," Okay, Michael, just settle down.   				",7,12,117
Pam," Yeah, just a little, I have a lot to deal with today.",7,12,117
Pam, [throws resolution board away in dumpster] Lesson learned.  				,7,12,117
Pam," No, it doesn’t have to just be cow stuff, right?   ",7,13,118
Pam, You could have just told us what you were thinking. ,7,13,118
Pam," Oscar, wait. I think the victory would be more meaningful if Erin puts the last word in herself. ",7,13,118
Pam," Here’s the story. That guy in there is Jim’s childhood friend, Tom. ",7,13,118
Pam," And when they were both in the third grade, Jim was placed in the top reading group. ",7,13,118
Pam," And Jim’s mom suggested that Jim spend time hanging with the kids in his reading group, because she though that would be a good influence. ",7,13,118
Pam, Wait. Can you back up? What’s the story? ,7,14,119
Pam, Aw you’ll get through it hon. Just make a game out of it. A funny “Jim” game. ,7,14,119
Pam, Got it. I will put out a A.P.B. Otherwise known as a “Ask Pam Beasley”. … Did the phone cut off?,7,14,119
Pam," Alright, just call me after the doctor. ",7,14,119
Pam," Cute. [enters office area] Very funny, everyone. Who wrote captions under my doodle? I’m not even kidding. They’re pretty good.",7,14,119
Pam, Well the first one has a surprise factor. “I’m a suck suck-suckidy Sabre!”,7,14,119
Pam," But, ah, I suppose the second one is the better written line. ",7,14,119
Pam," You guys, if I knew you wanted to do a caption contest, I would have drawn something more challenging. ",7,14,119
Pam," Yes. You guys, I have the perfect idea. Ok, it will just take me ten minutes. ",7,14,119
Pam," [on phone] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. ",7,14,119
Pam," No, wait. Hey, while you are out, could pick up some paper towels and chocolate syrup? We have ice cream so I thought… ",7,14,119
Pam," Ok. I, just, when you are done or any time it’s convent, I just thought since you are out… ",7,14,119
Pam," Ok, well it wasn’t obvious so… [phone hangs up]",7,14,119
Pam," Ladies and gentlemen, I think we have a winner. ",7,14,119
Pam," At least she lived a very long and I’m sure, a very happy life. Got you this card. When you’re ready. We all signed it. We just wanted you to know we’re thinking about you. ",7,15,120
Pam, It’s possible that some people thought it was your birthday. ,7,15,120
Pam, I’m missing my scarf. Oh. [both laugh]  				,7,15,120
Pam," Um, there was an amazing buffet and there was a chocolate fondue… station. And what else was there? ",7,15,120
Pam," That’s weird. I mean, that’s weird to have sex in the office. That’s where you work, right? ",7,15,120
Pam," You know, you’re in a meeting, and nobody knows that you’ve had sex there, except for you and him. ",7,15,120
Pam," Oh, yeah, we were. We were just looking to say hi. So hey. ",7,15,120
Pam, That was so embarrassing. I’m gonna die. ,7,15,120
Pam, Let me make something clear. Jim and I have never and will never have sex in the office. ,7,15,120
Pam," Besides, we have something those other people don’t have, which is a home and a bed. ",7,15,120
Pam," We’re all in it, from like years and years ago. It’s like a home movie. ",7,16,121
Pam," Michael screened a work in progress for us, years ago, and it didn’t go well. We thought it was a comedy. [flashback clip of Michael angrily leaving the conference room while the whole office is laughing at the tv] Everything pointed to it being a comedy.  ",7,16,121
Pam," Okay everyone, I know we’re really excited to see this movie that everybody’s in, but we have to remember that Michael is sensitive, so let’s stay positive! And no laughing, no comments, just positive energy and we’ll have a pure fun day! Okay?",7,16,121
Pam, You have to let us go Goldenface! We have families!,7,16,121
Pam," Looking at her mother on screen, horrified] Oh God… [looks at Michael] So good.",7,16,121
Pam," I got Erin a new computer, because the one at reception sucked. I should know. And I don’t wanna say the other one was old, but its I.P. number is one! [laughs sheepishly] Right?  				",7,17,122
Pam," Awwh, you’re welcome. [they hug] My pleasure.",7,17,122
Pam, I just helped someone out. It feels good.,7,17,122
Pam," [walking into the annex with Jim] Hey, um…",7,17,122
Pam," Ok, but listen. We just don’t have the budget for it. Okay? Reception needed a computer so we got one.",7,17,122
Pam," Yes, but Reception is a one person department. If I get you a new computer I have to get one for everyone in sales. For Dwight, for Stanley, it would be crazy.",7,17,122
Pam," [walking through the office, notices Andy with Erin’s computer set up at his desk] What the heck! Why do you have Erin’s computer!",7,17,122
Pam," Erin, it’s not up to you. This computer was for reception! Okay? It’s not yours to give away.",7,17,122
Pam," Andy, why should she have your crappy computer?",7,17,122
Pam, I don’t know if there’s really a private place in this office.,7,17,122
Pam, Okay. [walks to conference room with Andy and stares at the sign up sheet with wonder] When did people sign-,7,17,122
Pam," Well what was I supposed to do, let you walk all over me?",7,17,122
Pam," Okay, well I didn’t think about it like that. It’s just, I can’t do anything about it. I can’t replace that one unless that computer breaks.",7,17,122
Pam," Yeah, well if it breaks all the way I can get you a new one.",7,17,122
Pam," [in a car with Andy, by the dumpster you can see a new computer box] So listen, we have to really scuff this up. ",7,17,122
Pam, Come on Andy! I mean you said you wanted a new computer and this is the best I could do!,7,17,122
Pam," Yes, I found it in a shelf in the corner of the warehouse. [Darryl gives the camera an odd look]",7,17,122
Pam," [hesitating at the bribe] Yeah. You know what , I think I saw ONE sick day down there.",7,17,122
Pam," Dunder Mifflin is having our first own garage sale. Like many Americans, we realized we had a lot of things that we really didn’t need. And 10 cents of every dollar is going into the party fund so we can throw parties for ourselves.  				",7,18,123
Pam, It’s cold Dwight. Just shut the door and let people come in the front.,7,18,123
Pam, Hi..  I was just coming out to see what you were doing and to maybe stop you.,7,18,123
Pam," Michael, you’ve had two ideas today. And one of them was great. And the other one was terrible. ",7,18,123
Pam, You know what? I’m gonna get a hose. Then we’ll talk about it. Ok we’ll figure it out. Be right back. Just stay there.  				,7,18,123
Pam, Hey Michael everyone’s in the conference room.,7,18,123
Pam," And I’ve always believed that we should all be involved in everyone’s personal lives, in a very major way.",7,18,123
Pam, So we just… we wanna help you plan the proposal so that it’s safe and responsible and realistic and doable.,7,18,123
Pam, Ok I think animals and proposals are out. Right Ryan didn’t you read in one of your blogs that animals are out?,7,18,123
Pam, No she’s going to love it so I think you can keep the proposal simple. You know like when Jim proposed. He just he got down on one knee and he told me that he loved me and he asked me to marry him and it was perfect.,7,18,123
Pam, No it was really it was really sweet. It was raining and..,7,18,123
Pam," Really? Oh, my gosh! We just have the one, but she poops for four. [laughs]  				",7,19,124
Pam, Uh oh. Someone started off on the right foot with the new boss!,7,19,124
Pam," Hey, Deangelo, my mom just sent me this picture of Cece, it is so adorable.",7,19,124
Pam," See, we knew it! If he just met her, he’d understand.",7,19,124
Pam," Well the breadsticks are like what then, Ryan, what can I use?",7,20,125
Pam," You’re right, you’re right. I’m a middle class broad. [Jim does his “Jim face”]",7,20,125
Pam," Yeah… [they see Erin eating in her car, and ducking when they see her. Pam knocks on her car window] Hey, Erin, everything okay?",7,20,125
Pam, Why don’t you wanna eat lunch with your boyfriend?,7,20,125
Pam," Don’t you think it’s better to tell him the truth now? You know, rather than waste more of his time?",7,20,125
Pam," Wait, when am I…? You just have to be clear and firm. You know, just tell him you don’t love him. Just be honest with him. [Erin nods]  				",7,20,125
Pam," Michael, we were thinking maybe we could keep this thing going!",7,20,125
Pam," Let’s grab some ice cream, go back to the office, and finish what we started. [others nod in agreement]",7,20,125
Pam, Well we all wanted to plan your goodbye party. We thought this would be easier.  				,7,21,126
Pam," [Michael sits alone eating at the back of the kitchen, Pam comes in with Jim, Creed and Kevin] You should do more stuff like that.",7,21,126
Pam, So I’m going to Carbondale this afternoon to get a new bulk shredder.,7,21,126
Pam," It’s a good shredder, it just keeps breaking.",7,21,126
Pam, It’s not supposed to shred magazines Kevin.,7,21,126
Pam, I don’t think any of them are supposed to shred magazines.  				,7,21,126
Pam, [in conference room with the party planning committee] So Michael said we can do whatever we want cake-wise. What do we want?,7,21,126
Pam," [stopping her] Okay, don’t turn this into some feminist issue.",7,21,126
Pam," You know what, I think we should get some other input.",7,21,126
Pam," Oh, hey Michael! I’m just going to go to Carbondale to price some shredders. I’ll see you later.",7,21,126
Pam, [walks into a movie theater showing The King’s Speech]  				,7,21,126
Pam," [watching Michael’s plane take off. Crying and has smeared make up on] No he wasn’t sad. He was full of hope. About Colorado, and he was hoping to get an upgrade as an award’s member. And he said he was just real excited to get home and see Holly.  				",7,21,126
Pam," Hey, well, good morning.  I think I have good news for you today.  I found your new executive assistant.  My friend Carla.  [looking at resume]  She’s got great experience.  We even considered making her Cece’s godmother, but she had this boyfriend at the time– but here’s her resume.",7,22,127
Pam, Is that what he tells you at your little inner circle meetings?,7,22,127
Pam, [imitating Deangelo’s pretend juggling routine] Look.  I’m juggling eggs and bowling balls.  I’m juggling with one hand.  No hands.,7,22,127
Pam, What could he possibly stand to gain from a real juggling routine?  How can you keep defending him?,7,22,127
Pam, [to Jim] Why don’t you talk to him about it?,7,22,127
Pam, Why don’t you just tell him how his actions are being perceived by the women in this office?,7,22,127
Pam," So, Jordan, uh, where did you work before?  Uh, a law office?",7,22,127
Pam," So, umm, is this your first office job then?",7,22,127
Pam," Jim, what are you doing?  Get in there.  This is not the time to take a stand.  At least he likes one of us.",7,22,127
Pam," [to Jim] Just go in.  Just go in, he probably forgot to text you.  				",7,22,127
Pam," So one afternoon, while walking home from school, quirky 10th grader Becky Walters finds a wounded Pegasus in the woods.  And she becomes…The Horse Flyer.  				",7,22,127
Pam," [knocking on door to Deangelo’s office as loud yelling comes from inside it] Hey!  It sounds like you guys are having a lot of fun, but it’s really loud, and some of us are trying to work, so do you think you could do it a little more quietly?",7,22,127
Pam, Do I at least get to go with you in this fantasy?,7,23,128
Pam, You mean the frozen mice for the piranha?,7,23,128
Pam, Why do you need to wear the holster at all?,7,23,128
Pam," Dwight, no gun, okay? Don’t make us call Jo. ",7,23,128
Pam, You have to get rid of all your weapons. All of them. Including killer fish.,7,23,128
Pam,"  [to Dwight, who is reading the want ads] Should you really be so blatant about that?",7,24,129
Pam,  Are you really going to apply for work at Scranton Breadworks?,7,24,129
Pam,"  [looking at an engagement ring on Angela’s finger] It’s gorgeous, Angela.",7,24,129
Pam,  [laughing] Oh-ho-ho! He talked about himself in the third person?,7,24,129
Pam,  Hang up. [Creed hangs up] Corporate needs you to find the differences between this picture and this picture. [shows Creed two similar-looking photos of some building] Intel has told us there were at least seven.,7,24,129
Pam,"  The Senator? [Oscar nods] He was married before, and he has a kid.",7,24,129
Pam,  And don’t say that thing about how lots of gay guys have kids.,7,24,129
Pam,  The windowless building by the Baskin Robbins.,7,24,129
Pam,  Forget it. I’m never gonna know what goes on there.  				,7,24,129
Pam,"  [looks over at Oscar, who is quietly watching this happen] I hope… you have a very beautiful wedding, Angela.",7,24,129
Pam,  A homeless person. Really? A homeless person.,7,24,129
Pam,"  No, I want you to say that you think the ‘best’ person to be our new manager is a homeless person.",7,24,129
Pam,"  Ohh, hey Gabe, I’m sorry, we… we didn’t get you a cake or anything. We’re gonna miss you.",7,24,129
Pam,"  [in high-pitched, damsel-like voice] Is that right?",7,24,129
Andy, She’s pretty hot huh? [Jim nods]  She’s completely crazy.  Steer clear Big Tuna.  Head for open waters.,3,1,31
Andy," Big Tuna is a super ambitious guy, you know?  Cut your throat to get ahead kind of guy, but I mean I’m not threatened by him.  I went to Cornell, you ever heard of it? [laughs]  I graduated in four years.  I never studied once.  I was drunk the whole time, and I sang in the acappella group, “Here Comes Treble.”  					",3,1,31
Andy,"  OK.  Who put my calculator in Jello?  Good one.  But uh, seriously, guys who did this?  Seriously guys, who did this?  I need to know who put my calculator in Jello, or I’m gonna lose MY FRICKIN’ MIND!  					",3,1,31
Andy, We’re on the German team.  Shoot the Brittish.  ,3,3,33
Andy, Saboteur!  I’m going to kill you for real.  This game— the game is over.  I’m really going to shoot you.    ,3,3,33
Andy," [coughing out his words] Suck up!  Josh, did you hear what I said?",3,4,34
Andy, Hey.  What are we doing?   What’s the game?  I want in.,3,4,34
Andy," Hey, Big Tuna, can I talk to you for a second. ",3,5,35
Andy, Can you stand up? And talk to me over there?,3,5,35
Andy," Yeah, really. You asked for my help, so I helped.  ",3,5,35
Andy, I don’t care ’bout anything but you… what ever happened to those guys?  ,3,5,35
Andy," We have such a roller coaster thing, Karen and I.",3,6,36
Andy, Roller-coastery friendship. Hot. Cold. On again. Off again. Sexual tension filled type of deal. It’s very Sam and Diane.  ,3,6,36
Andy, [sings Indigo Girls] I went to the doctor. I went to the mountains. I looked to the children… ,3,6,36
Andy," [sings] I looked to the children, I drank from the fountain.",3,6,36
Andy," No way, dude. I am not driving home. I have brought an inflatable bed for just such occasions. You’re welcome to share it though. It’s a roomy twin.",3,6,36
Andy," Um, sorry… the Scranton branch is closing? [Karen nods and Andy looks at Jim] In your face!",3,7,37
Andy," [surrounded by clapping coworkers] Stamford, Connecticut! Stamford, Connecticut!  				",3,7,37
Andy," [after screaming and throwing papers around in the kitchen] What’s up, Josh?",3,7,37
Andy, So what’s he like? Likes? Dislikes? Favorite sports? Favorite movies? Favorite men’s magazines? ,3,8,38
Andy," Playing your cards close to the vest. I get it. Good luck over there, Tuna. Cross me and I will destroy you. ",3,8,38
Andy," I’ll be the Number Two guy here in Scranton in six weeks. How? Name repetition, personality mirroring, and never breaking off a handshake. I’m always thinking one step ahead. Like a carpenter that makes stairs.  ",3,8,38
Andy, And you must be Michael Scott. Aloha and… hello.,3,8,38
Andy," Michael, thank you for welcoming me to your little kingdom, Mike. ",3,8,38
Andy," Michael Scott. Thank you. I appreciate it, Mike.",3,8,38
Andy, Andy Bernard. Regional Director in Charge of Sales.,3,8,38
Andy, Which on a film set is the highest title there is. Do you know anything about film?,3,8,38
Andy," Am I trying to get under his skin? Yes. Because the angrier he gets, the more marginalized he becomes. Meanwhile, Andy Bernard is out there layin’ on the charm.  ",3,8,38
Andy," Hey, Angela. Check this out. It’s my new screen saver. ",3,8,38
Andy, Thank you. You have such a pretty smile by the way.,3,8,38
Andy, [sings drum beat intro to ‘What is Love?’],3,8,38
Andy," Oh, probably because of all the nose candy.",3,8,38
Andy, Dwight may have won the battle. But I will win… the next battle.  ,3,8,38
Andy," Michael, I would just like to say you have handled this entire situation with great aplomb. ",3,8,38
Andy," Saw your dorkmobile in the parking lot. What does it get, like four miles to the gallon?",3,8,38
Andy," Yeah, my Xterra’s pretty sweet. Luxurious, yet rugged. Leave it to the Japanese.",3,8,38
Andy," Actually, it is. It’s Latin for “earth.”",3,8,38
Andy," Yeah, I bet you would. Oh, by the way, 1985 called. It wants its car back.",3,8,38
Andy," Oh, speaking of time machines, I just got back from the future and I went to your funeral and, guess what, nobody came.",3,8,38
Andy," Oh, that was a really well constructed sentence. You should be an English professor at Cor-not University.",3,8,38
Andy," If I were an idiot, I’d be driving a TransAm.",3,8,38
Andy," Oh, I think you can, Big Tuna. Tell me about that Indian chick, Kelly. She seems pretty slutty. Good for a romp in the sack.",3,9,39
Andy," Next. How about… [motions toward Angela]. Blondes are more fun. C’mon, trust me on that.",3,9,39
Andy," Okay fine. Um. Pam, the receptionist. Paaam. Should I go for it?",3,9,39
Andy," All… righty, let’s get started. What is she into?  				",3,9,39
Andy, I started the main Frisbee golf club at Cornell. Where I went to college. I live to frolf.,3,9,39
Andy," Pam-a-lama-ding-dong. Listen, you’re cute. There is no gettin’ around it. So… I don’t know if you like country music, but I was thinking maybe one of these days we could drive out to a field, crank up some tunes, smoke a few Macanudos… maybe even toss a disk around.  Utway ooday ooyay inkthay, Ampay? ",3,9,39
Andy, Shh. Think about it. I’ll hit you back.   				,3,9,39
Andy, I’m gonna go get my banjo out of my car.,3,9,39
Andy," [singing] So we’ve been told, and some choose to believe it, I know they’re wrong, wait and see, ’cause one day we’ll find it, the ainbowray onnectionkay, the lovers, the dreamers, and meeee…   				",3,9,39
Andy, If I may say. She’s even prettier that you described her. ,3,10,40
Andy," Hey, what’s the haps? [Dwight shuts door in his face.]",3,10,40
Andy," Hey. I can’t concentrate when I know you’re in pain, man. Let me take you to lunch. [Michael sighs.] C’mon, my treat. ",3,10,40
Andy," That’s my boy. I know the perfect place, too.",3,10,40
Andy," No. Benihana. Much classier. But don’t worry, the babes are totally hot, too. [do a fist bump and explosion]",3,10,40
Andy," So she looks really hot, so I said, “You look hotter than usual today.” [to waitress] Thank you. Michael [gesturing to sit down.] Head of the table. ",3,10,40
Andy," So she looks at me right, and she goes, “I’m sorry, don’t I even know you?” After a year, a ",3,10,40
Andy," Put that away. Put that away. S.O.S. We… I… May day. Haha. Man down over here, [to waitress] we need your help. ",3,10,40
Andy, I think we’ll start with a round of noga-sakes. [waitress gives confused look]  					,3,10,40
Andy," One part eggnog, three parts sake. Some places won’t make it for you though, because eggnog is seasonal.  					",3,10,40
Andy," Wait for the onion. Trust me. Hey Cindy, he just had his heart broken, you wouldn’t do that to him, would you?",3,10,40
Andy," You made her laugh. Yes! She totally digs us. [referring to what chef is doing] Watch, watch, watch, watch. [Onions smoke up] Heh, heh? What did I tell ‘ya?",3,10,40
Andy, This drink… [in audible conversation with Michael],3,10,40
Andy," I want you to close your eyes and imagine your dream house. [Cindy laughs] C’mon, do it for Michael. He’s had a really long day. ",3,10,40
Andy, Now open your eyes and describe it to me. ,3,10,40
Andy," [referring to waitresses] They have been checking us out, all night! I am not kidding!",3,10,40
Andy," Now, you are thinking. Yes. And you know what? Because you have had such a rough day, you get Cindy. ",3,10,40
Andy, I am now chopping off Phyllis’ head with a chainsaw! … Rin-in-in-in-in-in!  ,3,11,41
Andy, Ole ole – ole ole… Ole ole – ole ole. People in the party – hot hot hot [playing conch shell]  ,3,11,41
Andy," Five of us transferred from Stamford. There are two of us left. Me and Karen. It’s like we are touring Willy Wonka’s Chocolate Factory and dropping off one by one. Well, guess what? I am not falling in a chocolate river.  				",3,12,42
Andy," Hey Dwight, pass the tardy sauce. Get it Michael?",3,12,42
Andy," Hmmm, well… let me think about this for a minute. Oh, I don’t know. Michael Scott.",3,12,42
Andy," Well, it is very gracious of you to accept. ",3,12,42
Andy, Sebring by Chrysler. Heck of a… motor… carriage. ,3,12,42
Andy," In order to take down Dwight, I have to chip away at his ally, which, in this case, is Michael. Here’s the good news. Every success I’ve ever had at my job or with the lady-folk has come from my ability to slowly and painfully wear someone down.   				",3,12,42
Andy, What’s the deal with Dwight doing your laundry?,3,12,42
Andy," Wow, that is a long story, but quite well told, Michael. I find it very interesting. Especially about the part Dwight going behind your back and basically, like, being a terrible person. You know if you want your laundry done right? I used to work at Abercrombie. So, pretty good folder.   				",3,12,42
Andy," I think you have assembled an amazing team at Scranton. It’s really a pleasure to be a part of it. It’s like, everyone has their own special skill, you know, just like the Superfriends. Except for Dwight, who is more like a SuperDud. I mean, he would be a Superfriend if there was a Superfriend whose super power was always being late. You know? ",3,12,42
Andy, My plan is taking longer than I thought but I don’t give up easily. I have walked two marathons. ,3,12,42
Andy, Caught an eighty-pound shark off of Montauk. It’s in the Hamptons. My dad’s got a 42-ft Bayliner. Sniped it with a rifle from the crow’s nest. Also shot a deer once. ,3,12,42
Andy," Ok, this is the classic undersell because you should know we don’t work out of a log cabin. We trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Ever heard of it? It’s in New York. ",3,12,42
Andy," I swear, this guy could sell paper to a tree. ",3,12,42
Andy, Oh man. Talk about your classic “Lame dash O.” Do we even want that guy buying our paper?,3,12,42
Andy, I… I’m so sorry man. I really screwed that up. ,3,12,42
Andy," ‘Schruted’ it. It’s just this thing that people say around your office all the time. Like, when you screw something up in a really irreversible way, you ‘Schruted’ it. I don’t know where it comes from though. Do you think it comes from Dwight Schrute?",3,12,42
Andy," I forget, why did Dwight say he was late this morning?",3,12,42
Andy," That’s weird. Because I was just walking past his desk and I saw this, which is a tollbooth receipt from New York City, stamped really early this morning. So, why would Dwight go to New York without telling anyone? Do you think he went to see Jan? That’s not like him. Is it? Someone told me a story about this, with, like, laundry and betrayal. Did you betray Dwight and try to steal his job or something?",3,12,42
Andy," Oompa-Loompa Doompity-Dawesome, Dwight is now gone which is totally awesome.  Why was he gone, he was such a nice guy?  No, he was not.  He was a total douche.  Doompity-doomp.   				",3,12,42
Andy," Um, am I happy the way things turned out? Oh, well, happy’s such an ugly word. But, um, I saw what needed to be done and I did it and now I’m thrilled. So, it’s pretty… [camera had focused in on Angela watching] Hello? Pretty good.   				",3,12,42
Andy, [to Ryan] Big Turkey. [cellphone plays “Rockin’ Robin”] ,3,13,43
Andy, All four parts. Recorded it on my computer. It took me forever.,3,13,43
Andy, Thank you muchly. [cellphone continues playing],3,13,43
Andy, I called it myself. I just thought you’d get a kick out of the new ring.,3,13,43
Andy, Side note. I’d just like to say I’m thrilled to be working directly beneath you.,3,13,43
Andy," I feel I have a lot to learn from you, even though you’re younger and have less experience.  So here’s to the future… Andy and the Tuna. [sings] Andy and the tuna…  ",3,13,43
Andy, Noooothin’. Ehrrrrrrrrr. Heh. Man. TGI-Wednesday. Am I right?,3,13,43
Andy," Gonna go home. Get my beer on. Get my “Lost” on. What are you doing later, wanna hang out?",3,13,43
Andy," Well, I will take that as a maybe. [Michael gets up] Where are you going?",3,13,43
Andy," Oh, well, I’m going to the kitchen, I’ll walk with you.  ",3,13,43
Andy," [lurking by the bathroom door] Yeah, things are going pretty good. Gettin’ a lot of face time with the boss.   ",3,13,43
Andy," Which is like, “Right on.” And Pam was like “blah blah blah” and you were like “Yeah, psht.” Nailed it. ",3,13,43
Andy," I think I could go for some tuna fish right about now. Oh, oh, got my rod here. [fake casts off] Whizzzzz. [catches Jim] Click, click, click, click, click, click, click. [Jim gets up] Cli — ah! I got one! I got one! Ahhhh!  ",3,13,43
Andy, 185 pounder. Check it out. Whew! [“displays” Jim who looks thoroughly annoyed]  ,3,13,43
Andy," [singing] In your he-ead, in your he-eyd-ed. Zombie. Zombie. Zombie. Ey, ey, ey, ey. In your he-eyd-ed.",3,13,43
Andy," [after Jim knocks over his pencils] Oh. Good move, Tuna. Nice one.",3,13,43
Andy, Large Tuna. Have you seen my cell phone device?,3,13,43
Andy, Cause someone is calling right now. There is a call.   ,3,13,43
Andy," [trying to look in Phyllis’s desk, she slams the drawer shut] I don’t trust you, Phyllis!  ",3,13,43
Andy, Wait up. Where are you going? Do you want me to come with?,3,13,43
Andy," Just listen, I forgot to tell you the plan for this Saturday. You, me, bars, beers, buzzed. Wings. Shots. Drunk. Waitresses, hot. Football – Cornell/Hofstra. Slaughter. Then a quick nap at my place and we’ll hit the tiz-own.",3,13,43
Andy, Duh. Which is why I was just joking about doing that. ,3,13,43
Andy," Fine. I’ll just sit at my desk and be quiet. Sorry I annoyed you with my friendship. [Andy’s phone rings] Excuse me. And I’m also sorry that a lot of people here for some reason think it’s funny to steal someone’s personal property and hide it from them. Here’s a little newsflash! It’s not funny! In fact, it’s pretty freakin’ unfunny!  Oh, my GOD. [punches a hole in the wall] That… was an overreaction. Gonna hit the break room. Does anybody want anything? Pam, you good?",3,13,43
Andy," So Michael had a little chat with corporate and they decided to send me to management training. Anger management, technically, but still. Management material. [gets out of his car] This whole thing supposed to take ten weeks, but I can be done in five. How? Name repetition, personality mirroring, and positive reinforcement through nods and smiles. So, don’t worry about old Andy Bernard. I’ll be back. Just like Rambo, so.",3,13,43
Andy," Oh, hi! Yes. I am and you must be… Marcy!",3,13,43
Andy," I graduated from anger management the same way I graduated from Cornell.  On time.  Now I’m back.  Got a second chance, and I’m not gonna blow it.  [in a forceful voice] So look out Dunder Mifflin!  [laughs] [snaps] I mean, look out… in a fun way!  You know, not like, I’m gonna hurt you…  				",3,18,48
Andy," Hey guys!  Guess who’s back! [Dwight pepper-spray’s Andy] AHHH! [screams in pain] OH, GOD!",3,18,48
Andy, Apology not… accepted.  Because it wasn’t even necessary in the first place. [laughs]  					,3,19,49
Andy," Several weeks ago, Andy Bernard had an incident. [cut to shot of Andy punching a hole in the wall] But after five weeks in Anger Management, I’m back.  And I’ve got a new attitude.  And a new name.  And… a bunch of new techniques for dealing with the grumpies.  					",3,19,49
Andy, Cool.  I can’t control what you do.  I can only control what ,3,19,49
Andy, Drew. [walks to Dwight] Dwight.  How’s it goin’ man?  					,3,19,49
Andy, I’m gonna need… I’m gonna need petty cash.,3,19,49

Andy," [English accent] William Dolittle at your service.  A.K.A., Will Do.",3,20,50
Andy, Hand me that water.  I always say “Beer me.”  Gets a laugh like a quarter of the time.  So how’s what’s-her-name?,3,20,50
Andy," Who, Karen?  Yeah, she’s only one of my oldest friends.  [takes swig of water] Mmm.  How’s the apartment hangin’?",3,20,50
Andy," Nice.  Check out this sunshine, man.  Global warming, right?  Today was supposed to be really cold, I bet.",3,20,50
Andy," Uh, yeah.  Should have said so.  [sings] Rha-dah-dah-dah!  Give me the beat, boys, and free my soul.  I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away-he-hay.  Ruu-da-doo-da-doo, ba-dit-da-doo-da-dun, Give me the beat, boys, and free my little-ole-soul, I wa–",3,20,50
Andy," Your call, dude.  My girlfriend made an awesome mix.  Beer me that disc.  				",3,20,50
Andy," So, Tuna.  When we get in there, let’s do a really good job, okay?",3,20,50
Andy, Well not everything a guy says needs to be said.  Sometimes it’s just about the music of the conversation.    				,3,20,50
Andy, Whoa!  What the— Why is my girlfriend here?,3,20,50
Andy," No, she’s a part-time frozen yogurt chef.",3,20,50
Andy," I wonder if she’s, like, a… a guidance counselor, or something?",3,20,50
Andy, You never told me you were in high-school!,3,20,50
Andy, Huh… We didn’t do anything illegal.  Except knock over a mailbox with her friends.  				,3,20,50
Andy, Who was that guy she was talking to?  At her locker.,3,20,50
Andy, [scoffs] Pfft.  You don’t teach it well enough.  One of your students is a ,3,20,50

Andy," Listen, man, I really appreciate you letting me shadow you today. I feel like I learned a lot.",3,21,51

Andy," What’re you doing? No! See, now we’re disqualified.   				",3,22,52
Andy, I am okay if I lose every single contest today. Honestly. Because I see these contests as an opportunity for me to demonstrate what a good sport I am. Mallard! [throws a stone]   				,3,22,52
Andy," [begins to clap] Great job everyone, that was fantastic. [Michael sighs]  				",3,22,52
Andy, [slams fist onto table] I am so hungry! [starts eating hot dog real fast],3,22,52
Andy, I didn’t win. But the only reason I didn’t win is because I recently learned that it’s better to work thing out with words. ,3,22,52
Andy, Yeah it is. I totally could have kicked your butt so bad. ,3,22,52
Andy," Yeah, right, c’mon! C’mon! [Dwight and Andy wrestle]",3,22,52

Andy," I agree. But in another way, I am off to a very good start, wouldn’t you say?    				",3,23,53
Andy," I am a great interviewee. Why? Because I have something no one else has: my brain. Which I use to my advantage, when advantageous.   				",3,23,53

Andy,"  After numerous projections that the computer would crush all salesmen in it’s path, I am very happy to report that our very own Dwight Schrute has crushed his electronic nemesis, if you will, by a whopping fifty-two reams.",4,3,57

Andy, Are you looking for dinner and a movie?  Because you’re not going to find it in that box.  [Camera pans to Kevin giving an “are you kidding me?” look],4,3,57

Andy," Look Angela, I know this is weird because we work together, and up until and possibly now I’ve repulsed you, but I like you.",4,3,57

Andy," I need some advice. I’ve been spending a lot of time making out with Angela lately. But we’ve been necking, but only necking.  Right? Not actually kissing, our mouths, just the neck on neck. It’s just like rubbing slash nuzzling our necks together. It’s hot, I’m not going to lie to you , but it’s a little weird, but you seem like a guy with answers, so how do I fast track this to get to first base?",4,5,59
Andy," Does anyone actually know what Sue Grafton looks like? I mean, is she hot or-?",4,5,59

We’re makin’ out, I’m kissin’ her neck, and cheek and her ear lobe, and she’s not really kissing me back. But she closes her eyes and she’s like, “Oh D, oh D.” ",4,5,59
Andy," [singing] Claude Van Damme, Hair for Men, poison gas, NutraSweet. [speaking] It’s gotta rhyme with “piece.” Fancy Feast! [sings] Break me off a piece of that Fancy Feast! It’s the cat food. Nailed it.   				",4,5,59

Andy,"  Sweetheart. [Angela turns around] Just so you know, I don’t care where we get married. I’ll marry you right here in this building. I’ll marry you in the parking lot.

Andy," Come on, you think you can get into Cornell?",5,5,67
Andy," Well he’s had a pretty good season so far— Stop saying “we.” You did not go to Cornell. Okay, you’re just doing this to screw with me.",5,5,67
Andy," I know it’s an excellent school, Dwight. I went there. My blood runs Big Red.",5,5,67
Andy, Take that down. [Dwight has hung a large red Cornell banner from the ceiling],5,5,67

Andy, [outside men’s room] You might be interested- [stops when he sees Stanley come out],5,5,67

Andy," Yeah. Big one. So, should I not let you in now, or do you want to do the interview, and then I won’t let you in?",5,5,67
Andy,"  Excellent. When the hourglass strikes three, then in the room whence employees confer.",5,5,67

Andy, Let’s see how well you know your Big Red history.,5,5,67

Andy, What are you writing? Can’t even give Cornell your full attention?,5,5,67
Andy," “Applicant is attempting to blackmail interviewer, showing low moral character.”",5,5,67

Andy," [on phone] Yeah, I’m looking at it right now. It’s really gorgeous. You guys do great work.  ",5,6,68

Andy," [on phone] Would you be able to do the same design, but with walls of gray? And a top that’s gray too? Fabulous.  ",5,6,68

Andy," [at computer, spins chair around and makes triumphant gesture] Yes!  ",5,6,68

Andy," We haven’t decided on anything yet. We’re still reviewing some options, and it’s gonna come down to the numbers.",5,6,68
Andy," Oh, thank the good Lord. Deal! [shakes Dwight’s hand]",5,6,68
Andy, Can’t argue with that. Dwight … [takes Angela’s hand] You are going to make us so happy. [Dwight and Angela grin at each other]  ,5,6,68
Andy, I’m just bidding a bon voyage a La Mon Petit fiancee. Translation:,5,7,69

Andy," Dude, you struck out.  They’re totally stuck up.  Here… drink up.  				",5,7,69
Andy, I see through a hard exterior to a little jelly in the middle.  She is teaching me to be a better person. And she’s working really hard on that.  And she has the softest skin I’ve ever seen and I can’t wait to have sex with her.,5,7,69
Andy," Honestly, I don’t know what we’re waiting for.",5,7,69
Andy, I should call her and ask her. What is wrong with her?,5,7,69
Andy," Too late, too late. It’s dialing… now it’s ringing. [Oscar laughs] Shh…",5,7,69
Andy, That was Oscar and he wants to know why you won’t do me and I think it’s a valid question.,5,7,69
Andy, We’ll discuss it later naked.  I want to see you naked.  				,5,7,69
Andy," You know, it’s true what they say— Long Island iced teas are way stronger in Canada.",5,7,69

Andy," No, the note is way more obnoxious than the mess.",5,8,70
Andy," Dwight, I’m a little concerned about some of these directions to Schrute Farms…",5,9,71
Andy," I mean, like, “156 paces from the light red mailbox, make a left.”",5,9,71
Andy," Let’s three-way this little issue, and come to a solution by the time we get to Schrute Farms, how’s that for a plan?  				",5,9,71
Andy," We’re getting married at Schrute Farms, no matter what. I have looked at twelve venues, I have lost eight deposits, and I have seen Angela naked zero times. I am not losing another deposit.  				",5,9,71
Andy," Uh, Dwight, if we pay extra, could you slaughter the entrees the day before?",5,9,71

Andy, [sings] There’s a hole in the wall where the men can see it all.  				,5,10,72
Andy,"  When I was in college I used to get wicked hammered. My nickname was puke.  I would chug a fifth of socos, sneak into a frat party, polish off a few people’s empties, some brewskies, some Jell-O shots, do some body shots off myself, pass out, wake up the next morning, puke, rally, more soco, head to class.  Probably would have gotten expelled if I had let it affect my grades, but I aced all my courses.  They called me Ace.  It was totally awesome.  Got straight B’s.  They called me Buzz.   				",5,10,72
Andy," All right, everybody’s still here.  Perfect! Got a little surprise I’ve been working on.

Andy," [entering the office] Excuse me, everyone, can I have the floor please? Um, this is insanely awkward. It’s kind of the elephant in the room, so I’ll just… [sighs] No one has RSVP’ed to our wedding yet, and the deadline was yesterday.",5,11,73
Andy," No, no one has RSVP’ed, and I don’t understand it, and now, you’re shutting me out. You’re not even listening. That’s really considerate. Thank you.",5,11,73
Andy," [on the phone] That cannot be true! [Dwight jumps] You’re going to charge me a fee to cut my own cake? Uh, no. No, no, no. What I’m saying is, I want to cut it myself…",5,11,73
Andy, You guys should… be hearing what I’m saying.  				,5,11,73
Andy, [through the car window] Kick Wallace’s ass!,5,11,73
Andy, [enters the office and walks to Angela] I need to talk to you.,5,11,73
Andy, Just answer the question. Are you sleeping with Dwight?,5,11,73

Andy, I am a man! I’m a bigger man than you’ll ever be! I would never sleep with another man’s fiance!,5,11,73
Andy," Protect her from what? Bears, you idiot? When’s the last time you saw a damn bear in Scranton?",5,11,73
Andy," What did you say? I’m sorry, I couldn’t hear you.",5,11,73
Andy," What? You stupid idiot! [Andy honks his horn] You’re like, you’re like a Sasquatch! You live in the woods…",5,11,73
Andy, I don’t get it! How can she be sleeping with you this whole time and only sleep with me twice?,5,11,73
Andy," [enters, followed by Dwight, and makes a call] Yes, hi, my last name is Bernard, and I would like to cancel a wedding cake that I had ordered. B-E-R, N-A, R-D. Yeah, the one shaped like a sailboat… Yep, that’s the one.",5,11,73
Andy, Each side will have three minutes to prepare opening arguments. Topic:,5,12,74
Andy," Okay, it is time for the final votes. All of those in favor of resolution Hillary Swank is hot? [half of office raises hand] Okay. And all those opposed? [he skips back and joins other half of office in raising hand]",5,12,74

Andy, [in a British accent] A throne for your highness. ,5,13,75
Andy," Oh you can tell by the way I use my walk I’m a woman’s man, no time to talk. Music loud, women warm, been kicked around since I was born. Oh, it’s alright, it’s okay, [Michael and Kelly join in] you can look the other way. Loo do do! ",5,13,75
Andy," Hope you brought your appetitos.  My lady. My tuna. A little movie popcorn. [dumps popcorn in bowl, it’s almost all seeds] Uh, damn it.  This movie, a lot of buzz.  Not coming out for another six months.  Mrs. Albert Hannaday. So, friendship with the Nard-dog has its privileges.  				",5,13,75
Andy," Jim and Pam are, like, movie geniuses. They’re catching things that are totally going over my head.   				",5,13,75
Andy," I know it man. You know, Lilly was supposed to be Nicole Kidman, um and it was gonna be Sophie’s mom, not grandmother. But then Nicole kidman dropped out so they went with Lily, with a small rewrite.  				",5,13,75
Andy," Yeah… but… eh… breakfast? You mean when they were eating soup? I don’t think that was breakfast. Unless soup, does soup symbolize breakfast?",5,13,75
Andy," [singing and playing the guitar] What I hate about you, you really suck as a boss, you’re the laziest, jerkiest and you’re dumber than applesauce. We’re stuck listening to you all day, Stanley tried to die just to get away, heeey, well it’s true. That’s what I hate about you. That’s what I hate about you. Yeah. And now, a man that deserves no introduction, Michael Scott.",5,13,75
Andy," I am not insightful enough to be a movie critic. Mm… maybe I could be a food critic. These muffins taste bad. Hmm, or an art critic. That painting is bad.   				",5,13,75
Andy," For your information, I have been with lots of beautiful women.",5,14,76
Andy," I am single now. What we have here, is the ultimate smackdown between the Nard-Dog and crippling despair, loneliness, and depression. I intend to win.  				",5,14,76
Andy," [looking into Julia’s car] Trying to see what CD’s she got. It’s good to know the deets about the girl you’re wooing. Eh, Aha! Fiest. Yes! [bangs on car and alarm goes off] Whoa! Aah, Aah! [backs up and runs into another car starting another alarm]  				",5,14,76
Andy," Brought you guys some coffees. Stanley, I know you have adult onset diabetes. So I put Splenda in yours. Let’s see. How many did I put in there? [starts singing to the tune of Feist’s 1234] One, Two, Three, Four Splenda’s in your coffee, Stanley. None in yours, Julia, cause I don’t know how you take it. But if you’d rather…",5,14,76
Andy," Well, No, I actually only put in two. But that’s not how the songs goes.  				",5,14,76
Andy," Are you out of your damn mind? You bring an angel like that into this office, and you don’t even set me up with her.",5,14,76
Andy," We are friends. Stanley, we’re friends. And you let me down.",5,14,76
Andy, Yeah. I really like her with all my heart.,5,14,76
Andy," So Julia, um, let’s see. With regards to, uh, billing. Should we send bills to you, or to your boyfriend’s house or?",5,14,76
Andy," Oh Okay, all right. That makes sense. How does your boyfriend, deal with your phenomenal success? Is he just, like, totally threatened by you, or?",5,14,76
Andy," [stammers] Really? Is that… wow, that’s so weird.  				",5,14,76
Andy," Guys, stop everything. I’m about to ask out this girl, and I’m completely panicking.",5,14,76
Andy," Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I’ve seen her, like, three times today. And we love all the same music, and whenever I walk into a room, she totally looks up.",5,14,76
Andy," Oh, my pleasure. Yeah, there’s all kinds of weirdo’s out here, so…",5,14,76
Andy, I am about to die. [laughs] Will you wait here while I go get my jacket?,5,14,76
Andy," Okay, Okay. Well listen, you’re a new client, and as one of my new clients, you will always be taken care of. And that is the Nard-Dog guarantee.",5,14,76
Andy," Oh, I’m sorry. I’m sorry. Oh I, I thought we had this energy. And I’m a mess. And I just had my heart broken. And you came in today and your so pretty. You’re, like, incredibly pretty.",5,14,76
Andy," Yeah, right? Wow. Yeah. Do you want to talk about it? Go to a mall of something? Just walk around?",5,14,76
Andy," Sure, yeah that’s… your right. It’s too soon for… definitely too soon for me. So I’m glad we go that out of the way. I’m gonna be in touch with you. In three months. I’m gonna call you about that order. And maybe about that mall walk.",5,14,76
Andy, [as Julia is pulling out] Sorry I tried to kiss y…  				,5,14,76
Andy," Golden Girls. That’s a golden ticket idea, right, I mean how great was that show? Golden Grahams. Another, is it — I don’t get this… ",5,17,79
Andy," [sighs] You’re making it too easy for her. You’re just conveying, ‘Oh I like you just the way you are.’",5,17,79
Andy, You’re asking him to give up all of his power. ,5,17,79
Andy," You can’t let a girl feel good about herself. It will backfire on you. Every compliment has to be backhanded. ‘Oh I like your dress, but I’d like it more if you had prettier hair.’",5,17,79
Andy, Don’t touch her. Don’t talk to her. Don’t look at her.  ,5,17,79
Andy," [Jim, Andy and Pam all talking over each other] …turn into this black and carbon brick-where this barbeque sauce of shame and rage and two hot people with a perfect relationship would not understand that.   ",5,17,79
Andy," Well, it’s uh, his funeral. So… neh!   ",5,17,79
Andy," Here it is, here it is… truck, to refrigerators, to dumpster, [camera pans to refrigerator boxes, then dumpster] 360 onto the pallets, backflip gainer to the trash can.",6,1,81
Andy, [to Michael’s camera] Hardcore Parkour!,6,1,81
Andy," [leaps from trailer, disappears into empty refrigerator box]",6,1,81
Andy," [inside refrigerator box, sounding injured] Parkour!   				",6,1,81
Andy, [serious] Who told you that? Was it Broccoli Rob? Someone from Chi Psi? Or did you run into someone from my high school?,6,1,81
Andy,"  This is not the first time rumors about me being gay have come up. Twice before, actually. Just a weird coincidence… a little too weird. [chuckles nervously] Almost makes you wonder if it’s not a coincidence at all. Whoa! Which it is, of course. [long pause] But it makes you wonder.  				",6,1,81
Andy, [to Oscar in break room] Did you hear the rumor about me? That I’m gay?,6,1,81
Andy, Do you think it’s true? Do you think that I’m… gay?,6,1,81
Andy," [scoffs and chuckles] No! But, let me kick you a scenario. I’m at a beach cabana, and Brad Pitt approaches. He tries to lean in and kiss me. I would definitely resist, like at first. But if he was persistent, [long pause] I think I might give in a little bit, just to see what it… felt like.",6,1,81
Andy," Would I push him away? How hard? Like, what if he’s like really aggressive?",6,1,81
Andy," It’s not real Brad Pitt, this is like, this is my fantasy. Or it’s like, not a fantasy, it’s just… it’s just a scenario.",6,1,81
Andy," [to Jim] Tuna, how come you never try to set me up?",6,1,81
Andy," No. I mean, for the record, I prefer women.",6,1,81
Andy," But off the record, I’m kinda confused.",6,1,81
Andy," Yeah, the evidence is sort of stacked against me, I feel like… ",6,1,81
Andy, Alright. [looks around uneasily] Well hey… ,6,1,81
Andy, [chuckles] Come on… little baby Tuna. Little junior toro.,6,1,81
Andy,"   How are my sales doin’?  Busted.  My numbers are down a little bit and it’s ’cause of the economy.  You’re not buying it, you’re good.  Okay the truth is, I have been having trouble focusing lately.  I’m in this weird, flirty, nebulous thing with this cousin of mine and it’s a total mind effer.  ",6,2,82
Andy,"   Oh, I’m sorry Phyllis, you explain this email, okay.   “Hey Andy let’s go visit grandma and then get drunk together, ha ha.”  ",6,2,82
Andy,"   Oh, just backing up and turning around.  ",6,2,82
Andy,"   Dit, dit, dit, dit, it’s not for you. [enters the conference room]  Pardon moi, Messieurs.  I took the liberty of preparing for you a cheese platter which I will place here on the eastern wall of the conference room.",6,2,82
Andy,"   Oui, Oui, Monsieur.  From the Wisconsin region, a nice firm cheddar.  Also from the great state of Wisconsin, an aged parmesan.  Here you will find a cheddar style spread which has reacted nicely with the air to form a light rind which I think you’ll  find both challenging and delicious.  At that point, I would recommend you take a trip south of the border to the great state of Illinois where you will find this fine Bleu Cheese dressing.  If I may be so bold, it’s a lot of fun to let the goldfish take a little swim in the bleu cheese.  Bon appetit.  ",6,2,82
Andy," There’s no way that Stanley gets more beans than me. [starts to take Stanley’s beans, Stanley swats Andy’s hand with his crossword puzzle] That is ridiculous. This is how it works. [everyone continues to argue]    				",6,3,83
Andy," Thank you! That is exactly– by the way, I would also like a raise.",6,3,83
Andy," [Dwight peels a hard-boiled egg at his desk, sniffs it and takes a bite; Pam stares at him, picks up her trash can and pukes into it] Watching people get sick always makes me sick. And… frankly so does talking about it. So… wow…  [Andy, Phyllis, Meredith, Erin, Oscar and Angela all proceed to throw up in various places while Creed looks on eating a bowl of noodles; Dwight stares shocked; Pam wipes her mouth with a satisfied look]  				",6,4,84
Andy," What happens in Niagara, stays in Niagara. [laughter]",6,4,84
Andy," [in Andy’s car, Andy driving] Hey, do one of you guys want to sit up front with me so I have someone to talk to?  It’s like a five hour drive-ish, you know.",6,4,84
Andy, Not only is Erin really sweet and cute… she smell’s like my mom.  				,6,4,84
Andy, Hey. I got the room the night before you guys. I’ll break in the bed. [laughs],6,4,84
Andy, How did Meredith get put at the young people’s table?,6,4,84
Andy, What? You’re kid– That’s– You’re–  				,6,4,84
Andy," Chicks are gonna be off the hook. Guys, too, Oscar. Like Calvin Klein models.",6,4,84
Andy, Nothing. Except $40 for beer and any hot chicks you know. ‘Cause that would help me deliver on some promises I made. Woo!  				,6,4,84
Andy, No one from the office has been to a real Bernard throw down.  				,6,4,84
Andy," If I was girl, I would seriously reconsdier coming to this party. But don’t tell anyone that I said that, ’cause I want them to come.  				",6,4,84
Andy," You call that a robot? Try being more robotic, ok? Like this.",6,4,84
Andy, Did someone change my name to Baskin Robbin? Because I feel like a banana split. Woo! [Andy does a split and screams out in pain],6,4,84
Andy, I was dancing and I did a split and I landed on my car keys in my pocket.,6,4,84
Andy, I tore my scrotum. I need you to take me to the hospital.  				,6,4,84
Andy,  Everyone else is too drunk.  Just don’t let me die here.,6,4,84
Andy," Well, at least slow down a little bit because every little bump in the road is major pain on… my scrotum.",6,4,84
Andy,  I was trying to liven things up a little bit.  I was kinda doing your job so–,6,4,84
Andy,"  Well it’s also to make sure that we have a great time at your stupid wedding, so–  ",6,4,84
Andy," [Pam swerves the car back and forth] Ow, ow!  				",6,4,84
Andy, [snickers] I spent the night with the bride the night before the wedding.  Ah yeah.  She stepped on my hand on her way to the bathroom.,6,4,84
Andy,  Oh cause of last night?  No way.  Reports have been exaggerated.  Weddings make me very emotional.  I um–I just have that side to me.  ,6,4,84
Andy,"  No, it didn’t–nothing got torn off.  Who told you that?    				",6,4,84
Andy,"  It was my scrotum.  Um, and it was.  Thank you.",6,4,84
Andy," All mobsters have a front, sometimes it’s selling insurance, sometimes it’s waste management or sanitation.",6,5,85
Andy," Yeah, buy my insurance or I’ll burn your warehouse down!",6,5,85
Andy, Yeah right! You heard him! He’s gonna burn down the warehouse or run one of our trucks off the road.,6,5,85
Andy," [hangs up, rips cord from phone] That is the stupidest thing you could do right now!",6,5,85
Andy," Not only that, but if they find out you snitched, you get a dead horses chopped off head in your bed!",6,5,85
Andy," When somebody threatens you, you give in right away. Okay you need to buy insurance from this guy and get him off your back",6,5,85
Andy," Wait let’s hear him out, this is interesting.",6,5,85
Andy, [snaps fingers] I like this plan. I’d like to officially withdraw my plan.,6,5,85
Andy," No, no, no. My plan is out! We do this the hard way.",6,5,85
Andy, Well you’re gonna have to. [overlaps] Dwight:,6,5,85
Andy," Well if I’m gonna back you up, I need a weapon without drawing suspicion, and I have to justify it somehow so, I’m a mechanic with a tire thing. ",6,5,85
Andy," To change tires, no. But it’s metal, I can hit somebody with it.",6,5,85
Andy, Well then I can’t use it. I’m just gonna hide it.,6,5,85
Andy,"  [with Soprano’s inflection] You know, gabba-gool.",6,5,85
Andy," Black goes on the red. With the… If we… Positive… Mo- it being a motor drive, it’s probably down.",6,5,85
Andy," You want to do this junior? I didn’t think so. Sorry. It’s kind of a long day at the… mechanic store. [Andy places connections wrong, smoke and explosion set off] Aaaah!  You got a leaky spark tube.",6,5,85
Andy," So your car’s totaled. Uh, you’re just gonna want to get a refund on that. Or my guy could do it. He’s great. But uh, I can’t do that for you. I work exclusively on motorcycles. [Andy walks away, woman is exasperated]  				",6,5,85
Andy," Yeah. Just thinking about how, uh, I had this car, this Italian car, and I was driving it, and it kept telling me how much it needed oil, but I wouldn’t give it any oil. And then, one day it exploded and it killed everyone and that’s what I’m afraid of. ",6,5,85
Andy,"  It was before, my tech- my technical training.",6,5,85
Andy," You were man enough to back down Michael, I’m proud of you.",6,5,85
Andy,  That we surgically remove the fear center from Michael’s brain?,6,5,85
Andy," No, Michael. What we’re trying to say is, we made a mistake assuming he was mafia. I have a buddy who’s a Fed, and we did a background check on the guy.  His background is perfectly clean.",6,5,85
Andy, He’s trying to intimidate you to close sales. He’s just a pushy salesman. ,6,5,85
Andy," Next time you look in the mirror, you’re gonna be looking at a guy who stood down the mafia!",6,5,85
Andy, You made the mafia apologize to you! You made the mafia be polite!,6,5,85
Andy,  [in Jim’s office] How may I be of service to you?  ,6,6,86
Andy,"  [both look at Dwight, Jim waves] This aurea is a joke. ",6,6,86
Andy,"  [both look at Dwight who is standing right outside the office] Let me tell you something, if you respect him at all, you will get him something better.  ",6,6,86
Andy,"  Trust me it would only make you mad.  [opera continues, Dwight looks at Jim standing outside his office, waves, Jim waves back]  				",6,6,86
Andy,  Is this because of the 60 Minutes segment about working conditions in our Peruvian paper mill?  ,6,6,86
Andy, [singing] Where are you? Dean Trophies. Suite 100. Sherman  Blinds and Rugs. Suite 202.,6,7,87
Andy," Except it was going to resolve the melody, so now my head hurts. Feels like I held in a sneeze. Mmm! I hate this feeling. [sings] Suite 401.  				",6,7,87
Andy, We’re kind of a dynamic duo. Or trio. [points to Pam’s tummy],6,7,87
Andy, [miffed] Looks like somebody’s got a case of the definitelies.  				,6,7,87
Andy," Oh, wow. You thought that- oh, my gosh. Oh. Definitely not.",6,7,87
Andy," Nuh. Actually, it’s kinda not ok. Um, I date models. Face models. My girlfriend, on a scale of one to Giselle, uh… a nine.",6,7,87
Andy," Pam’s carrying our surrogate. Because my girlfriend needed to keep her figure for fashion week. So, we, uh, we put our baby in Pam.  Doesn’t matter what Pam looks like.",6,7,87
Andy, No I wasn’t. Ok. The very idea of us together made you burst out laughing like you just bit into an Adam Sandler and jelly sandwich.,6,7,87
Andy, Let me tell you something. I was never gonna make that sale.  				,6,7,87
Andy, That is our sales pitch and we are stickin’ to it. ,6,7,87
Andy, Yeah. You know. Two peas in a pod. We complete each other. What can I say? She loves to cook- ,6,7,87
Andy, Right. Sometimes I’ll just dance for hours in the living room- ,6,7,87
Andy," In fact, we spent the whole weekend researching various birthing coaches. Wasn’t that fun, honey?",6,7,87
Andy," One of the baby books suggets the best birthing posture is on all fours, like an animal. I just wish I had a special telephone so I could find out exactly wht the little soy bean wants. Right? Hey, little soy bean. What do you want? Right. How do- It- I felt it kick!",6,7,87
Andy," Oh, my gosh. Like a little magical foot just high-fived me.",6,7,87
Andy," Oh, my gosh. It’s like he’s trying to say, ‘I love you, too, Daddy’. I love you, too. [leans over and kisses Pam’s belly]",6,7,87
Andy," Message received, little soy bean.  				",6,7,87
Andy," We got a maybe. It was our first maybe. Going by the Nard Dog curve, I’d say we nailed it.",6,7,87
Andy, You know what? I’m sorry. ‘Cause in that moment I knew I was kissing your belly too much.,6,7,87
Andy," Agh- try almost cried, ok? I just got caught up in the fantasy.",6,7,87
Andy," No. I know I’m gonna go with Miss Janet. I just- I don’t know. It was fun to role play, right?",6,7,87
Andy," I mean, it was fun for me. Having a wife and a little baby. Agh, I’m so sick of being single.",6,7,87
Andy, What do you think of Erin? I mean- she’s- I- She’s kinda cool.,6,7,87
Andy, Wow. H & H.  You went all the way to New York City to get us bagels? ,6,8,88
Andy,"  Oh, Dwight.  I have a little surprise for you.",6,8,88
Andy,"  Yes! [they laugh] And I wanted to return the favor.  I was polishing my loafers and I happened to look over and noticed that your brief case was a little worse for the wear, so a little elbow grease and she’s polished right up, back up to her former glory.",6,8,88
Andy,  You give me a gift– Bam!  Thank you note.  You invite me somewhere– Pow! RSVP.  You do me a favor– Wham!  Favor returned.  Do not test my politeness.    				,6,8,88
Andy,  Thank you very much.  Now I’ve got it for you. [holds open door],6,8,88
Andy,"  Hey– oh, hold on a second.  Do not walk around with your jacket cattywampus.  ",6,8,88
Andy, Whoa–  thank you very much.  [takes off Dwight’s glasses and blows on them]  Oh boy.,6,8,88
Andy, [puts Dwight’s glasses back on Dwight’s face]  You are very welcome.  ,6,8,88
Andy, [pulls out Dwight’s chair] Have a seat yourself.  ,6,8,88
Andy, [singing fanfare] Aye-yi-yi! [lifts covers off trays of food],6,8,88
Andy," Yep, yep.  Took a page right out of the old Schrute book of niceness.",6,8,88
Andy,"  You bought breakfast for everyone, so I got lunch for everyone.  ",6,8,88
Andy,"  Whoa, whoa Dwight.  I’m going to do this.  ",6,8,88
Andy, [reaching for something on the top shelf]  Ahh.  ,6,8,88
Andy,  Stupid things wedged up there.  No one in this office will help me.,6,8,88
Andy,  What if Dwight dies and I still owe him something?  That is a recipe for a ghost.  				,6,8,88
Andy, It’s like a little envelope– there you go.,6,8,88
Andy, Surprise! [laughs]  It’s from everybody.  $15 value.  				,6,8,88
Andy," I got it, I got it… Oh, Tuna beat me to it.",6,9,89
Andy,"  I like Erin. There, I said it.  I was kinda hoping she would ask me out, but things have not panned out on that front, so… it is time for the Nard Dog to take matters into his own paws.  				",6,9,89
Andy," Nathaniel Nutmeg, the local bartender and Nellie’s brother.  				",6,9,89
Andy,"  Well, you do actually.  You’ve got this kinda like Florida Panhandle thing going, whereas what you really want is more of a Savannah accent, which is more like molasses just sorta spillin’ out of your mouth.",6,9,89
Andy,"  Uh, not familiar, what province is he from?",6,9,89
Andy," I reckon I got something to say to Miss Beatrix Bourbon, if’n she don’t mind.",6,9,89
Andy, I would be remiss if I did not ask the pretty young lady out on a date for this weekend.,6,9,89
Andy,"  I’m a little worried I might have asked out Naughty Nellie and not Erin.  Which would be a whole lot less appealing, because Naughty Nellie says yes to everyone.  And she might be a murderer.  				",6,9,89
Andy,"  Just thinking about Weekend at Bernie’s.  It’s funny, the guy’s dead the whole time.",6,9,89
Andy,"  Speaking of weekends, you excited about our date this weekend?",6,9,89
Andy,"  [accent] Well, finest steakhouse in all Savannah.",6,9,89
Andy,  Totally… not. [Erin gets up and walks away]  				,6,9,89
Andy,"  [Andy, Michael, and Dwight are pointing imaginary guns at each other] I didn’t do it!",6,9,89
Andy, That’s aerosol spray. It’s terrible for the environment.,6,10,90
Andy," [doing an announcer voice] Ladies and gentlemen from Scranton, Pennsylvania, please welcome Michael ‘The Machine’ Scott. [Michael waves, twirls and sits down]",6,10,90
Andy, [still doing the voice & spinning in his chair] Hate the twirl!,6,10,90
Andy," Hey, guys, do you think anyone might have had sex in here?",6,10,90
Andy," Michael, what if somebody asks you a question at this meeting? Are you just gonna wave, or what?",6,10,90
Andy," Make it a softball. Something he can, like, crank out of the park.",6,10,90
Andy," Yeah. Well, you should do that. Get in line.",6,10,90
Andy," Look, do you want to be able to tell your grandkids you stood up for yourself during the – America’s biggest financial crisis?",6,10,90
Andy, You should get up and say something. You’ve got to be true to what’s in there. [points to Oscar’s heart] Don’t be a wuss.  				,6,10,90
Andy," I’ve always been the guy who can rally other people to rebel. In high school I organized a walk out over standardized testing. Got over 500 students to just skip the SATs. At the last second I chickened out, took it anyway, got a 1220, always regretted it. I feel lachrymose .  				",6,10,90
Andy, Is it serious? [Michael stares]  Wow.  Andy’s a wittle scared.,6,11,91
Andy," Would you rather me say “Hey guys, my irritable bowel syndrome is flaring up?”",6,11,91
Andy, “Crazy diarrhea happening right now?”  Cause things can get real adult real fast.,6,11,91
Andy," Do I sometimes replace Rs with Ws? Yes.  Do I sometimes repeat a word to get my point across?  Well if I do, Andy’s sowwy.",6,11,91
Andy," Well if I we’re complaining, a lot of people think your Elvis voice is annoying.",6,11,91
Andy," I don’t-just people.  For the record, I think it’s pretty fantastic.",6,11,91
Andy," Dr. Tuna, MD, I have some terrible news.",6,11,91
Andy, The entire office has come down with a pernicious case of the Mondays.,6,11,91
Andy," 0%, unless we perform an immediate emergency morale transplant, stat!",6,11,91
Andy, Don’t worry.  There is a surefire cure.  Employee of the Month.  Every awesome place I’ve worked has had one.    				,6,11,91
Andy," Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, AIG, my summer at Enron.  				",6,11,91
Andy, Jim’s talking to Michael right now.  They totally went for our idea!,6,11,91
Andy," Number nine, number nine.  Jim Halpert.",6,11,91
Andy," That would be employee number three, which would be… son of a bitch, Pam Halpert.",6,11,91
Andy," Oh, really? From what, two to four?  				",6,11,91
Andy," Why would you wrap it in a sheet, if you’re not covering anything up?",6,12,92
Andy, I begged Dwight and Jim to give me Erin for Secret Santa. And I decided to give Erin the Twelve days of Christmas. Is it my fault that the first eight days is basically thirty birds? [six geese are inside Erin’s car]  ,6,12,92
Andy, Yeah! Totally serious! I’m your Secret Santa! Busted!   ,6,12,92
Andy," Hey Phyllis, could you not reveal to Erin that I’m her Secret Santa?",6,12,92
Andy," I suppose a gentlemen might… throw in the towel, at this point. Guess what? Not gonna happen.   ",6,12,92
Andy, Merry Christmas Erin! Take it away boys! [dances along to the drumming]  ,6,12,92
Andy," Great news, Michael. We’re now the official paper supplier of the NFL.",6,13,93

Andy," Saber. [sings] Dunder Mifflin and Saber. So yeah, yeah, yay, yay.",6,14,94
Andy," I am telling you, there are no strawberries in here.",6,14,94
Andy," Well maybe they ran away, because the pizza was like, [imitating Italian accent] “Hey, get out of here, you stupid strawberries.”  				",6,14,94
Andy, The ball’s totally in Erin’s court. After the whole drum line thing.   				,6,14,94
Andy," Uh, no, actually. So nothing? No movies, or parties, or anything you might want to invite someone to?",6,14,94
Andy, [Jo’s dogs are sniffing at his crotch] These sure are pretty dogs…,6,15,95
Andy, Got some Valentine’s cards for my coworkers and my bro-workers.,6,15,95
Andy," Valentine’s Day, right around the corner. Erin and I have been on zero dates. So I got her a Valentine’s Day card, but I didn’t wanna seem “too eager,” so I got cards for everyone in the whole office to kind of dilute it a little bit.  				",6,15,95
Andy," [throwing a card at Meredith, which skims her throat]:",6,15,95
Andy," [almost running into Erin] Whoa-oh, traffic jam!",6,15,95
Andy, [imitating car noises] Beep-beep! Beeooop-beep!,6,15,95
Andy," There’s blood everywhere! Um, I got you a Valentine’s card.",6,15,95
Andy," Uh, Charles Schultz did. I thought it was relevant cause I got you all those birds for Christmas, remember?",6,15,95
Andy," Oh, look at that. They sure do. I hadn’t noticed.",6,15,95
Andy," Yeah! It’s Roger Federer for men, I sprayed some in there.",6,15,95
Andy, [has two tissues in his nostrils] It’s not cause of the smell. I’m just expecting a nosebleed.,6,15,95
Andy," [Erin leaves room] Excuse me? Everyone? Please check your emails, I just sent you the following message:",6,15,95
Andy," Phyllis, you guys are like my closest friends. I just mean I don’t like-like you.",6,15,95
Andy," “Please don’t read into this card. Yours in professionalism, Nard dog.”",6,15,95
Andy, It’s n– that wasn’t… I like someone else.,6,15,95
Andy,"  Yeah, no, you really should.  Because if your baby’s born tomorrow, he’s going to have the same birthday as Butt-mud Brooks.  My old roommate.",6,16,96
Andy,"  Guys.  Word of advice.  Speaking as a former baby.  Don’t get too hung up on baby names.  I was named Walter Jr. after my father until I was about six or so, when my parents changed their minds.",6,16,96
Andy,"  My brother was born, and my parents felt he better exemplified the Walter Jr. name, so they gave it to him.  I was given Andrew, which they got out of a baby name book.",6,16,96
Andy,  I can do the evolution of dance-dance.,6,16,96
Andy,"  Nope, actually music would just throw me off.  I need complete silence.  Okay…  [Pam begins to clap as Andy dances]  You’re clapping.  I need complete silence.  Totally threw me off, so I’m going to have to start over.  Evolution of dance-dance.",6,16,96
Andy,  What?  God damn it.  She was supposed to come out yesterday.  				,6,16,96
Andy,"  I decided to give baby Halpert a newspaper from the day she was born.  This frame set me back fifty five bones.  But she decided to take her sweet time, so now I have to switch it with today’s paper.  				",6,16,96
Andy,"  Torn scrotum.  Still on the mend, so not good timing.  				",6,16,96
Andy,"  Yes, I’m going to ask out Erin.  I’m just waiting for the stars to align.  Literally.  I have a small skylight in my bedroom, and I’d like for the moon to be visible.  				",6,16,96
Andy,"  Why was I hiding behind the plant?  Ha, well, in college, I took a botony class, and there was lots of drama in that class.  Uh, kids would gossip about me, so I would eavesdrop on them by hiding behind different plants in the botony class.  And then, uh, they would say things like “Oh, this guy’s going to fail this class,” or, “What’s this guy doing spying on us from behind plants?”  And then I would jump out of them and confront them, and be like, “Oh, you think all I do is hide behind plants and spy on people?  Busted.” …  Oh, the reason?  The reason I was hiding behind that plant in this situation was that I thought that Erin and Kevin were kind of hitting it off, and…  I was jealous.  				",6,16,96
Andy,  [he hits his head on the desk after ducking out of the way from hiding behind a plant]  Ow.,6,16,96
Andy,"  Erin, uh, I need you to send this fax immediately.  It’s really important, so I’m going to stand here and wait for the confirmation.",6,16,96
Andy,"  The fax says “Erin, will you have dinner with me?” from Andy, and the number is our office fax number.  				",6,16,96
Andy,"  Sorry, that’s unacceptable.  I need you to send it immediately, or you’re fired.",6,16,96
Andy,"  Oh, God, no.  I’m…  Just read the fax.",6,16,96
Andy, Thanks. It’s actually my sister’s old field hockey skirt.  				,6,17,97
Andy," Erin and I have our first date tonight, and it has to be perfect. Why? Because according to “How I Met Your Mother” that’s the date that your kids are going to wait patiently to hear about, and you better have a good story for them.  				",6,17,97
Andy, [Vocalizes and continues song] “The cat’s in the cradle and the silver spoon”,6,17,97
Andy, She should go home. It’s not the end of the world. We’ll go on our date next week. She’s still gonna like me in a week. Right?  				,6,17,97
Andy, I was just working at my desk and I wanted to run some new leads by you. [Turns feint],6,17,97
Andy," That’s okay, I’m in my “worky-works.” You look amazing!",6,17,97
Andy," Well, any brother of Erin’s is a friend of mine. Nice to meet you. Andy Bernard. [They shake hands]",6,17,97
Andy," So, how does the whole foster sibling thing work? Do you guys share one parent or-?",6,17,97
Andy, All right. Formative years. [She laughs],6,17,97
Andy," Ah. Oh great, now I’m gonna get sick. [They both laugh]  				",6,17,97
Andy, Well then no Andy Bernard per se. [Andy and others begin exiting the room],6,18,98
Andy," [on phone] Very nice. Let me just, let me just write that down real quick. [motions to Darryl] Pencil? Can you give me that pencil? Hang on Teddy… [covers phone] I’m making a sale. Sales.",6,18,98
Andy," Give me that [wrestles with Darryl, Andy falls over chair and to the floor]  				",6,18,98
Andy, Hey. I guess you probably won’t give me your leads since I’m a jerk salesman. ,6,18,98
Andy," All those who agree, say aye [all present – Stanley, Andy and Phyllis –  raise their hands] All those opposed – ",6,18,98
Andy, And I’ll text Erin. She’s really good at this stuff too.,6,18,98
Andy, Erin just texted me back. ‘People love shells from far-away beaches”.   				,6,18,98
Andy, Yeah. We wanted to bring you in and make a peace offering.,6,18,98
Andy," Oh wow, thank you. You’re the nicest person I’ve ever met. [Andy and Erin kiss]   				",6,18,98
Andy,A bunch of us are talking about happy hour. ,6,19,99
Andy,"Erin, I need you to fax this and get me a confirmation, pronto. [whispering] Are you going later?",6,19,99
Andy,"We recently struck up a romantic relationship. And, um…  but we’re kinda keeping it quiet for now ’cause it’s still kind of a new thing. It’s a little delicate, and we just don’t want all the drama.",6,19,99
Andy,"Yeah, cause when everyone knows- [knock on window, open blinds to Kevin giggling and making sexual gestures] That’s actually pretty funny, but in general, you know.",6,19,99
Andy,"A bunch of us are going to get some drinks, you in?",6,19,99
Andy,"Wow, can you imagine what people would say if they saw us dancing together?",6,19,99
Andy,"They’d be like, ‘what’s up with those two?’",6,19,99
Andy,"‘Did we miss the wedding?’ Um, I got it-I’ll do this, and you play the racing game, and then we’ll switch.",6,19,99
Andy,"This is exactly what I don’t want, the drama. I don’t want the drama!",6,19,99
Andy,"We just have to throw everyone off the scent a little, so follow my lead.",6,19,99
Andy,[Andy sits at table with another woman] Hi.,6,19,99
Andy,Just sit down next to a beautiful woman and start talking to myself to confuse other people.,6,19,99
Andy,[Andy spits out his drink] What are you doing?,6,19,99
Andy,"We didn’t say we were gonna, like, start groping strangers!",6,19,99
Andy,Get in here. [Andy and Erin go into photo booth] Where did you learn to talk like that?,6,19,99
Andy,"Well, what movie? Black Snake Moan?  				",6,19,99
Andy,This is not what I want my relationship to look like. [holding photo strip of he and Erin fighting]  				,6,19,99
Andy,"[over PA] Hi, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Andrew Bernard, and I’ve been on two dates with Erin Hannon and they went well, and there will probably be more. Thank you.  				",6,19,99
Andy,"You know, it got to the point where keeping it a secret was just too much drama. And I hate drama, so there you go.",6,19,99
Andy,"I know, I do, right? I’m a total drama queen.  				",6,19,99
Andy," It’s Secretary’s Day. And it is Erin’s and my three-week anniversary. So perfect storm for a romantic gesture. [Andy unfurling a giant “Happy Secretary’s Day” banner by reception, placing a teddy bear on Erin’s chair]. Want to make sure the whole office remembers it’s Secretary’s Day. I sent an e-mail blast, a text blast, a good, old-fashioned talk blast. I sent a snail mail blast a week ago.  And a Stern reminder via fax at 7:00 this morning, so people better step up and appreciate the crap out of Erin.   				",6,20,100
Andy," If it wasn’t for secretaries, I wouldn’t have a stepmom.  				",6,20,100
Andy, [arrives at Michael’s office and sits] I was just wondering what you had planned for Secretary’s Day.,6,20,100
Andy," Yeah. She really looks up to you. And there’s only so much we can do as her coworkers. Secretary’s Day is really kind of a boss-secretary thing. [Michael glances over at Erin in reception, Erin waves her teddy bear’s arm at Michael].",6,20,100
Andy, [slams his hand on Michael’s desk] That’s my girlfriend you’re talking about.,6,20,100
Andy, [taping desk] She’s gonna be so psyched.   				,6,20,100
Andy, Was it everything that you hoped and dreamed it might be?,6,20,100
Andy," Well, I know. [stammers] Just want… I mean… [chuckles] ",6,20,100
Andy," Hey. Can I have your attention please? First of all, thanks to everyone for helping put this awesome party together. And a very special shout-out to the chair of the Party Planning Committee, miss Angela Martin. You have outdone yourself.",6,20,100
Andy, I am saying the exact opposite. Angela is fantastic.,6,20,100
Andy," Ok. As some of you may know, I have a very special connection with Secretary’s Day in the form of that 115 pound moonbeam over there named Erin Hannon. To a lot of you she may just be the person who brings you your fax comformations. But to me, she is my girlfriend… in addition to being the person who brings me my fax comformations. So I wrote [starts to use a British accent] a little ditty. That I would like to play for all of you right now. It’s a little tune called Secretary of Love. A one, a two, a one, two, three..",6,20,100
Andy, Why would that be something to talk about on Secretary’s Day?,6,20,100
Andy," I was going to tell her, just on my own time.",6,20,100
Andy," Who cares? I mean it’s not like I killed someone. Big deal right? This can blow over in two seconds. She never asked me. So, if you think about it… I probably should have told her I guess. Everybody does stupid things.   				",6,20,100
Andy," Will you stop walking for one second? That’s it. There’s no other secrets. Ok? I mean yeah, my chest is not naturally hairless, and my parents pay my credit card bill.",6,20,100
Andy, Yeah but that’s it. Now you know everything about me. I promise. And if I think of anything else…,6,20,100
Andy," Sometimes telling someone something is hard. Well, at least someone made her happy on Secretary’s Day.  				",6,20,100
Andy," Well, why don’t you just move the M&M’s?",6,21,101
Andy," You know, when I tore my scrote, I was, uh… I was seeing this really hot urologist about it, and thought she was into me. But now I think she was just doing a bunch of stuff to bill my HMO. You know, she’s touching around down there. It’s easy to get confused. ",6,21,101
Andy," Of course. Yeah, that’s terrible. Okay, let me get back to you. Hey, Stanley. One of my clients just called and said that their Sabre printer started smoking and caught on fire. ",6,22,102
Andy," Hey, Gabe I need to talk to you about something. It’s really important.",6,22,102
Andy," Yeah, I don’t know. Look, one of my clients called. He was in the middle of a big printing job and the back of the printer started smoking and then the paper tray caught on fire. ",6,22,102
Andy, What? You don’t know what it meant? How about “Andy is a problem and we must eliminate him?”,6,22,102
Andy, [chuckles nervously] Yeah. Hah. Hoo.   				,6,22,102
Andy, Creed’s head of quality assurance. So he’d definitely be wrapped up in this.   				,6,22,102
Andy," I might have to go public here, but no one’s gonna believe me. Uh… I need proof. I need, like, a printer to catch on fire.  ",6,22,102
Andy," [in old Michael Scott Paper Company’s “office”] We’re printing on 24-pound premium stock paper, approximately 300 sheets in. So far, no signs of distress. [Darryl is filming Andy’s demonstration]",6,22,102
Andy," Right. My name is Andrew Baines Bernard, and if you’re watching this, it’s because I’ve turned State’s witness because I’m in danger because I know too much. ",6,22,102
Andy, Higher? Okay. [speaking slightly higher] Recently certain events have come to my attention… ,6,22,102
Andy, [high-pitched] I have come to the conclusion that the Sabre corporation… ,6,22,102
Andy, [higher] May be overlooking certain safety regulations. At the danger… [printer starts smoking and explodes] ah! [speaking lower] It’s working. [in normal voice] It’s… I knew it! ,6,22,102
Andy," We are blowin’ the roof off! Blowin’ the roof off! [Darryl discharges fire extinguisher onto printer] Nice. Nice. This is my partner, Darryl Philbin. He’s been my partner through this entire thing.   				",6,22,102
Andy,  No secret crying. Hasn’t even opened the tissue box in there.,6,23,103
Andy,"  Well, it happened to Tom Hanks in Big.",6,23,103
Andy,  So you’re just making a giant assumption. You don’t even know the guy.,6,23,103
Andy,"  My name is Andy Bernard and I am a cuckold. For those of you unfamiliar with William Shakespeare, a cuckold is a man whose woman is cheating on him. I’ve lived the part. And let me tell you, I’d so much rather play the part on stage.  				",6,23,103
Andy,  So… here’s the thing about infidelity.,6,23,103
Andy,"  In any cheating movie, the person getting cheated on is the hero. You’re Ali Larter, I’m Beyonce.",6,23,103
Andy,"  This guy’s a high school baseball coach, right? Let’s go check him out, see what a horrible person he is. ",6,23,103
Andy,  Yeah. Those teams have games and practices every day. Let’s go check it out. ,6,23,103
Andy,"  Oh, really? I thought you were the boss. ",6,23,103
Andy,  [humming Call to Post] Bum bum BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM bum bum,6,23,103
Andy,  Stage right or stage left? I played batboy in damn yankees!,6,23,103
Andy,"  [announcer’s voice] And Now, coaching third base with two arms, two legs, and no heart. Capable of feeling pain. ",6,23,103
Andy,  Whatever. I’m the one blending in.   				,6,23,103
Andy,  Chase Dixon is up. Could be a big play.,6,23,103
Andy,"  And it’s–there’s– well, home plate is like a wicket.",6,23,103
Andy,  You do know that high school coaches don’t pay their players.,6,23,103
Andy,  You guys are awesome! Best game I’ve ever seen in my life.,6,23,103
Andy,  Ha. No. No. But we’re gay for baseball. [chuckles],6,23,103
Andy,"  But I have a wife, actually, who I really love a lot. ",6,23,103
Andy,  Yeah. I am so into the institution of marriage. ,6,23,103
Andy,"  I mean, isn’t marriage the best, you know? Two good people finding each other, getting all committed to each other. So you love baseball. What else do you love? Let’s round you out as a person. ",6,23,103
Andy,"  I get it, man. I love it. That’s what makes you a good coach. You know, but as a fan, it just helps me enjoy the game better if I know the coach loves his wife. ",6,23,103
Andy,"  But real quick, I want you to meet my associate. Sheldon!",6,23,103
Andy,"  Get- Get over here. Sheldon, say hi to the nice coach.",6,23,103
Andy,"  I just wanna go on record as saying that I do not condone this affair, and I went so far as to force Michael to confront the victim of his behavior. ",6,23,103
Andy,  Do you want someone to stop you? ‘Cause no one’s going to.,6,23,103
Andy," If you say anything, so help me God, I’ll break off the temples of your glasses and stick them in your eye sockets.  				",6,24,104
Andy," So unfair. Even if I thought that our printers killed baby seals, I would not be a whistleblower. The Bernards, for generations, have silenced whistleblowers. It’s how we made all our money. Woody Guthrie wrote a song about us. [sings] Old Mr. Bernard, old Mr. Bernard, who have you silenced today?  				",6,24,104
Andy, I swear on the graves of my parents who aren’t even dead yet.,6,24,104
Andy, I don’t know who’s giving Darryl any crap. He was more bothered about it than me.  				,6,24,104
Andy," Yeah. You know, I mean, for all we know it could have been… Jim.",6,24,104
Andy," Gabe, I told you all about the printers. ",6,24,104
Andy, You’re going to believe that guy?    				,6,24,104
Andy," Look, I didn’t want houses and schools to burn down, and children to die. Does that make me a hero? I…",6,24,104
Andy," Well, it doesn’t make me the worst guy in the world, either.",6,24,104
Andy," Uh, thanks. Yeah, you know, just seemed like the right thing to do.",6,24,104
Andy, Whoo! We did it! [everyone starts cheering]  				,7,1,106
Andy," Brocolli Rob, obviously, will be there.",7,1,106
Andy," And JC. We call him Blorville, because he looks like a black Orville Redenbacher. ",7,1,106
Andy," Am I angry that Gabe stole my girlfriend over the summer? No. I’ve been through anger-management, OK? So right now, I am sitting on a nice beach at Cape Cod, gazing out across the whitecaps. Oh, look, it’s a humpback whale. How pretty. He’s eating Gabe.  				",7,1,106
Andy," New guy sucks. Calls me the Nard-Man. I’m the Nard-Dog, okay? Nard-man is my father.  				",7,1,106
Andy," That kid is the worst. Needs to be fired, Michael.",7,1,106
Andy," You get that kid to open this car, or I’m gonna do it myself… by calling Tripple A.",7,1,106
Andy," Oh, my God, is it in my eyeball? I think he’s burning my eye.",7,1,106
Andy," [Phyllis and Andy act out Luke getting spanked] No, no, no, no. It’s the other hand. Right hand. Yeah.  				",7,1,106
Andy, [Dwight starts aggressively spanking Andy] Whoa! Whoa! Hey. Whoa. Dwight! Stop!  				,7,1,106
Andy,"  Well, tell us what it is. I mean, it would help us to get some context so we can get on board. ",7,2,107
Andy,  Did you call all of my clients at the mall and cancel all my business while using the “F” word?,7,2,107
Andy,"  No, you and I… and I. I’m going to come with you. ",7,2,107
Andy,  Did you assume that I would automatically side with the rich snobby shop owner? [removes cuff link] How about now? [removes other cuff link] How about now? [removes tie clip] How about now?   				,7,2,107
Andy,"  Julia Roberts goes into the store, and she’s like,” I was in here yesterday and you wouldn’t help me.” And the shop girl goes, “ok”. And Julia Roberts goes,” You girls work on commission, right?” And the girl is like,”Yeah”, and Julia Roberts goes…",7,2,107
Andy,  I was telling that… I was telling that.  				,7,2,107
Andy,  A gentleman who is a rich snob who will go into shopping malls and drop huge amounts of cash on clothes.,7,2,107
Andy,"  If someone offers you a cocktail, accept, but keep your wits about you. ",7,2,107
Andy,  [in a cockney accent] I think he’s got it!  				,7,2,107
Andy, Two comps. For my lady and her Gabe. It’s closing night. Tomorrow we have to give the theater over to the Scranton’s Miss Fitness pageant. ,7,3,108
Andy, What? That’s awful. Everyone’s gonna miss that guy.  				,7,3,108
Andy," Gabe is not coming, which is huge because my plan is to make Erin fall back in love with me tonight. Women cannot resist a man singing show tunes. It’s so powerful, even a lot of men can’t resist a man singing show tunes.  				",7,3,108
Andy," What kind of terrible rumor monger is Gabe? He is woefully misinformed, all right? Excuse me, clink, clink, clink, clink, everybody. You’re all coming to my show tonight, right?",7,3,108
Andy, It would mean so much to me if you came to my show tonight.,7,3,108
Andy," If it makes you feel any better, no one who auditioned for the part of Sweeney Todd got that part. They had to bring in a ringer. ",7,3,108
Andy, This guy’s like world-class. You should not feel bad. I’m asking you thespian to thespian. Will you please be the bigger man and come to my show?,7,3,108
Andy," My parents used to scramble to find babysitters so they could take my younger brother to do stuff. I understand how hard it can be. I just-tonight, if you could… ",7,3,108
Andy," I understand. This is, like, huge opportunity for her.   				",7,3,108
Andy, Just checking my e-mails. See if I got any last-minute “break a legs” or “I still love you” type texts. Doesn’t look like I got anything.  Maybe on my Facebook wall.   				,7,3,108
Andy, That monster of a judge has locked her-[cell phone chiming]. Locked her away. [phone continues ringing],7,3,108
Andy," Oh, it appears the bird was in mine own pocket this whole time. He’s gone to sleep now, I’ve closed his beak. [Michael laughs]",7,3,108
Andy," [text message chime] You know what? Let me just double check, that bird… Okay, good. It’s off. I mean, silenced. I silenced it by killing it. I’ve killed it! I’m a murderer! Just like you, Sweeney Todd. See, it all connects. Not that I know you’re a murderer. My character doesn’t know that yet. But I’m suspicious, because of all the razors that you have laying around. And you spend time alone. But you’re a barber, so that’s legit. So there’s that. But… ",7,3,108
Andy," Do you think… [bottle rolling] so you think… [bottle rolling, clanking]",7,3,108
Andy, [excited] That’s really irresponsible of Erin. She’s a terrible babysitter.  				,7,3,108
Andy, [pretends to slit her throat] Ah! Blood everywhere.,7,3,108
Andy," These would have been your seats. Best seats in the house. Lots of people think it would be the front row, but actually, right here, this is where the speakers converge, and the sound just, like, nails you right here. ",7,3,108
Andy," Thanks, but I feel like a loner right now. ",7,3,108
Andy," Okay, all right, all right, all right.   				",7,3,108
Andy, [sings Macy Gray’s “I Try” and everyone joins in]  				,7,3,108

Andy," Michael, have you ever been tested for STDs?",7,4,109
Andy," You know what guys, why don’t we just chill out on this herp-chat. Ok? I was an REA in college and I can tell you, number one sexually transmitted disease is ignorance.",7,4,109
Andy," Excuse me everyone, can I have your attention please?",7,4,109
Andy," Everyone, I’ve noticed that we have not been entirely kind to one of our own, due to stigmas and prejudices.",7,4,109

Andy," [singing] Ba na na na na. Hot pizza, check it and see. Ba na na na. Got a whole bunch of pepperoni. Ba na na na na. [stops singing] Yeah, now you’re looking at me. Anyone who’s interested in entering into an honest discussion about the sexual mores and taboos of modern society will be rewarded with a pizza break.  				",7,4,109
Andy," So, guys. I’ve been really bothered by the way certain people are getting treated around here, and I just think as an office we’re better than that. Ok, now I’m going to show you a picture of genitalia. [grossed our remarks from around the office as Andy holds p a picture of a nude man]",7,4,109
Andy, Perfectly normal genitalia Tuna. Now I’m going to show you another picture of perfectly normal genitalia. [Kevin is grossed out immediately. The office is grossed out],7,4,109
Andy," It’s normal! Big deal! Yeah sure it has some herpes on it, but you know what? It’s just as normal as anyone else’s.  				",7,4,109
Andy," Herpes, like all STDS, is a consequence of sex. Can anyone else name any other consequences?",7,4,109
Andy, [writing on board] Ok I guess I can make a pros column. Feels…,7,4,109
Andy," Umm, ok is that different from feels unbelievable?",7,4,109
Andy," I actually had that down in the cons column, but…",7,4,109
Andy," Ok, umm. I’ll move that. Thrill of risk.",7,4,109
Andy," Ok, unplanned pregnancy, going in the pros column.  				",7,4,109
Andy, Who can tell me what the safest form of sex is?,7,4,109
Andy," Incorrect, the only true form of safe sex, ok? Abstinence.",7,4,109
Andy, I just thought I’d bring it up in case someone in here was practicing abstinence. That’s all.  Anybody?,7,4,109
Andy," Well someone could answer if they want to. [looks at Erin hopefully] Ok, in that case I will now show you how to put this condom on… using this pencil. [Stanley laughs]",7,4,109
Andy," Well I’m not gonna use my penis, Oscar! It’s not exactly hard right now anyway. ",7,4,109
Andy, Well did you h- di- GAH! Does no one appreciate what I’m doing right now?! [throws pizza box at painting and leaves]  				,7,4,109
Andy," I don’t know, I mean people were being really mean to Meredith.",7,4,109

Andy," [reading Cornell magazine] Whoa. Libby Dirketts got married. Big Red mazel tov to the Libster. Ooh, says here Dan Becker fell off the side of Kilimanjaro in a climbing accident. It appears Dan’s Sherpa survived to tell the tale-Oh, my God!",7,5,110

Andy, What if the moon was your car and Jupiter was your hair brush?,7,7,112
Andy," Michael, you can’t go to Mexico. You don’t have your passport. ",7,7,112
Andy," [looking at Erin] Save me an aisle seat, Michael! I’m coming!  				",7,7,112
Andy, I will not stand idly by while these Mexican villagers are sick. ,7,7,112
Andy, Whatever. I won’t-I won’t stand for it.  				,7,7,112
Andy," Just a heads up. Probably gonna be borrowing a few things. Uh, gonna need a contact lens case, some sunscreen, some sandals…   				",7,7,112
Andy," Well, two days minus how long we’ve been on the road. 45 minutes? So, like, two days basically. Maybe more.",7,7,112
Andy," I don’t know, I thought it was like a gymnasium or… ",7,7,112
Andy," Do you smell like a weird, warm cheese?",7,7,112
Andy," Should I-I got it. I got it. [walks up to the bus driver] Um, hey, I saw a sign for a scenic overlook coming up. Really love to check out the view.",7,7,112
Andy," Well, uh, there’s a nice bistro coming up. We could pick up some Paninis for the road.",7,7,112
Andy," If we went to Mexico, we’d probably screw everything up anyway.",7,7,112
Andy," I bet he’s wishing he had a hybrid, right? Sixty miles to the gallon in the city.",7,8,113
Andy, [to Erin] You’re having a party at Gabe’s apartment?,7,8,113
Andy," Try and hide it, I will track this party down!",7,8,113
Andy, [pours powdered seahorse into his wine glass]  				,7,8,113
Andy," [enters room where Phyllis is pouring wine, using stadium announcer voice] Ladies and gentlemen please welcome, Phyllis Vance! [sniffs her] Isn’t that White Diamonds Maya Smith Taylor?",7,8,113
Andy," I just ate powdered seahorse! I have to admit I did not think it was gonna work, but it is totally working! [clip of him doing pull ups in Gabe’s doorway] I feel exactly like a seahorse! [Seahorse impression] Blub blub blub blub blub blub blub blub.  				",7,8,113
Andy," [muttering going on all around, Andy looks sick] Hey Creed, would you read Chinese?",7,8,113
Andy," [confused, rushes out of the room to the room Erin’s in, picks up phone, talking fast] Hello UPS! Still waiting on that five minutes with Erin order. Oh never mind it’s here. Oh if it isn’t the bell of the ball! [queasily] You throw a lovely party ma lady…",7,8,113
Andy, Did you wear my favorite outfit on purpose?,7,8,113
Andy," You’re four seasons in a day. [heaves] You… got the Autumn thing going on. But if you put on ba- [heaves again] Put if you put on a blue… [stops, is struggling] It’s Spring Time in the Rockies!",7,8,113
Andy, [throws up on bed] Puts pillow in front of the puke.,7,8,113
Andy, Well girls tell each other things right?,7,8,113
Andy," I didn’t know it’s powdered, so like four or five, I don’t know.",7,8,113
Andy, Anyone can just throw numbes up on a chart. What are you doing to make it happen?,7,9,114
Andy, Your doing the wrong thing. You’re gonna lose Michael’s investment. You’re gonna lose ours. ,7,9,114
Andy," If you tell Michael to sell, he’ll sell. ",7,9,114
Andy," All those in favor of selling, say aye. [all say “aye”]",7,9,114
Andy, I would like a muffa du blueberry por favor.,7,10,115
Andy, But I wanted you to know that Michael and I are wearing the same tie today. It’s insane.,7,10,115
Andy, [without looking at the pictures] Oh my gosh she is so cute. She looks like both of you.,7,10,115
Andy," Yes, but one good text away from a high five.",7,10,115
Andy, And then he will smugly pay the cheque and make you feel so small.,7,10,115
Andy," Damn it. Michael, you are moments away from the smack down of your life. If you don’t know something, steer the conversation back to something you do know.",7,10,115
Andy," Michael, I have to tell you something it’s from Rocky II.",7,10,115
Andy," This guy doesn’t just wanna win. Y’know, he want’s to bury you. He wants to humiliate you!",7,10,115
Andy, Shhh. You’re gonna scare ’em away. [two pigeons are eating out of a soft serve cone],7,10,115
Andy," Well, if we all jump really high, we’ll be in the air longer. Do that.",7,11,116
Andy," I will help. Although my ‘brid’, my hybrid, my Prius hybrid, won’t fit a tree. Which is ironic, considering how many trees it saves on a daily basis.",7,11,116
Andy," I do, however, have a hookup with a dude who has a pickup.",7,11,116
Andy," I should come along, just ’cause he’s my, you know, he’s my hookup.",7,11,116
Andy," Come on, it’ll be fun. We could do doughnuts in the snow on the way back.",7,11,116
Andy," [singing] Christmas tree, Christmas tree. Won’t you be my Christmas tree.",7,11,116
Andy," Ehh, seems a little full of itself, right? Kind of a pretty boy? What if we got a really beat up one, like on Charlie Brown. And we just loved it for what it is?",7,11,116
Andy," I don’t have kids or anything, but if my grandmother ever dies, I’m going to kill myself.",7,11,116
Andy," Nobody hug me, I’m covered in tree sap, so…",7,11,116
Andy, I am the mean old grinch. The little girl who wishes to win back the Christmas star must first succeed at these challenges.,7,11,116
Andy, No. You must answer topical political questions. How many congressmen is the state of Pennsylvania guaranteed? And what other state has the equal number?,7,11,116
Andy," The star has been hidden. Is the little girl hot or cold? Well, it turns out she’s burning up because the star is right behind her ear! [pulls star from coat and pretends to find it behind Jada’s ear]",7,11,116
Andy," Drink less caffeine. That’s a good one, Pam. Here’s mine.",7,12,117
Andy," Yeah. I love cooking, but I always find myself throwing out half the food that I prepare, so…  two years is time to just start preparing the right amount of food for the right number of people, which is one. ",7,12,117
Andy," No, some people don’t just meet someone. I’m fine with it. Really. This is not a pity party. It’s not a party at all. It’s just sad. ",7,12,117
Andy," You know what, that’s my new one. I’m taking that one, too.",7,12,117
Andy, All right! We should divide up by section. I will take romance and travel.,7,12,117
Andy," Hey, there’s a roller rink across the street! There’s always chicks at the rink.",7,12,117
Andy," I don’t know. Single moms at a skating party. Sweet sixteen, ten year reunion parties. ",7,12,117
Andy, Um… Dave Matthews Band. No hits! Deep tracks only.,7,12,117
Andy," Yeah, I did actually. His name is Andy, and he roller skates like a Greek god and you know what? I kinda like hanging out with him.",7,12,117
Andy, That’s actually “Master of Ceremonies” Bernard.   ,7,13,118
Andy," Last year, I went to a seminar called “The Ten Secrets of Real Estate”. Turns out it was just a ploy to sell me time-shares in Idaho. Cut to, you know, spending a weekend in Boise, terrible time, super lonely. But I get to thinking maybe I should put on my own seminar to lure clients.   ",7,13,118
Andy, Thank you so much Tuna Turner. You are simply the best. ,7,13,118
Andy, Go higher. I get super flexible when I’m nervous. ,7,13,118
Andy," No. What? You can’t do that. You are a critical part of this seminar. You’re the charming warm-up guy, ",7,13,118
Andy," If the seminar was a meal, you’d be the amuse-bouche. You like, signal the flavors of the whole night. ",7,13,118
Andy," I can’t have this go badly. I’m a terrible salesman, and I haven’t been making very many sales lately, or ever. This is my only idea on how to turn things around. If it goes badly, I might lose my job, which would suck because this is the only job I’ve ever been good at.   ",7,13,118
Andy," They’re not worms, Dwight, okay? They’re just people with tiny businesses. They’re baby whales which is even cuter. ",7,13,118
Andy, What? I already lost Jim. Salesmen are suppose to help each other out. We’re suppose to be a team. ,7,13,118
Andy," Kevin, Jim dropped out of my seminar, and I’m just… I was wondering if you could replace him as my charming warm up guy. ",7,13,118
Andy," Hey, that’s crazy talk. I think you’re great. ",7,13,118
Andy," Hi, Ryan, you went to business school, right? ",7,13,118
Andy, I need somebody to talk to this seminar about business. ,7,13,118
Andy," What do I put you down for, bro hombre? ",7,13,118
Andy," Okay, than you so much. It’s going to be so awesome. ",7,13,118
Andy," Ryan, you come in with your small biz expertise, right? And then Creed:",7,13,118
Andy, Welcome everybody. Awesome to see you guys. My name is Andy Bernard but you can call me The Nard Dog. ,7,13,118
Andy," Let’s get things started, shall we? You guys ready to hear from the Dunder Mifflin business experts? Good. Well, as you can see on your program… first up is a speech called, “Don’t Just Dream it, do it.” Yes! Please give a big hand to Mr. Kevin Malone. [plays Ozzy Osboure’s Crazy Train]",7,13,118
Andy, I’m really excited to introduce you guys to Ryan Howard. He has achieved a great deal in the last… ,7,13,118
Andy," Ladies and gentlemen, our special guest speaker will provoke you. He will inspire you. He is… Creed Bratton. [applause] ",7,13,118
Andy," [clapping] Okay. All right, ladies and gentlemen, it is now time for the rarest of things, an actual free lunch. There are sandwiches in the back. Certainly help yourselves. We’ll meet back up in an hour.   ",7,13,118
Andy," [turning towards Darryl] Hey, do you need a lozenge? ",7,13,118
Andy," Hi. Hope you enjoyed your lunch. Welcome back. [to Michael and Holly] Ooh. Well, hello. Welcome to the seminar. Hey, man. What’s goin’ on? ",7,13,118
Andy," Wow! What a day, right? Guess you guys are probably ready to go. And you got my business card, so… ",7,13,118
Andy," Okay, who would like to purchase this small business package from me right now? Yes, we got one. Okay, the snowball is rolling. Who else? You can put it off for a couple of days, but I guarantee you, eventually you’re gonna realize you need this. So the only thing that’s gonna be different is you’ll be a couple of days behind where you would be if you bought this from me right now. So who’s gonna buy one right now? ",7,13,118
Andy," Yes! Awesome! All right, anyone else? [younger guy raises hand] Sold! Anybody else? [older guy raises hand] Yes! All right! ",7,13,118
Andy, Good choice. The rest of you are dead to me. You made the stupidest decision of your life. ,7,13,118
Andy," But it was a pleasure meeting you, and you’ve got my information, so feel free to call anytime. ",7,13,118
Andy," Well, I guess when you looked in me, you forgot about my balls. They’re on the outside. Don’t how you missed ’em.   ",7,13,118
Andy," Hey, I heard you talking about movies before, and, anyway, I just watched this over the weekend. I thought you’d really like it. ",7,13,118
Andy, Oh it is on like Genghis Khan wearing Sean Jean in Buton. ,7,14,119
Andy, Birthday punches! [softly punching Darryl in the stomach] One two three four five sice seven eight!,7,15,120
Andy, …thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty twenty-one twenty-two twenty-three twenty-four twenty-five twenty-six!…  				,7,15,120
Andy, …So I got an early res at Blue Wasabi and I’m taking Rachel. She’s picking me up after work. ,7,15,120
Andy, Are you kidding me? It’s all I did every summer when my brothers were out sailing. ,7,15,120
Andy," But if there is a romantic thing with Gabe, I should probably…",7,15,120
Andy, D…d…d…d…don’t look. I accidentally did his Sudoku. [Stanley glares at Andy],7,15,120
Andy," She’s neat. Uh, I met her at Darryl’s cousin’s party. We were the only two white people there. ",7,15,120
Andy, [softy] We should actually probably talk about it outside or we might make Darryl mad. ,7,15,120
Andy," [softly] That makes sense, ’cause I feel like I’d be able to hear us at this level. ",7,15,120
Andy," Okay, Ryan’s the temp. What does he do at night? ",7,15,120
Andy," Oh, or maybe not. [turns out the lights]",7,15,120
Andy, Hmm. [points to Gabe blowing a kiss to Erin]  				,7,15,120
Andy, Some people are really popping on screen!  ,7,16,121
Andy, [the office cheers] Whoa Whoa Whoa! Isn’t the president evil?,7,16,121
Andy," [looking at his computer, gasps] Hey! Hey you guys! The Armeth Regado video is up, gather around! [no one moves] Check it out! This guy’s on a full beam reach. [watching a sailing video on his computer] They’re hiking out like mad! Lock ’em up! Lock ’em up! Nice job! Ughh. [computer is frozen, taps the top of it] This computer’s a hunk of jjunk.",7,17,122
Andy," This is a sick computer! Gwen Stefani has this computer! [to Pam, in a fake British accent] Uhhh, Pamela! What does a guy have to do to get, ahem, one of them?",7,17,122
Andy," Yeah, but if you donated my computer to Africa, it would become world famous as the slowest computer in Africa. So…",7,17,122
Andy," Well Andy’s desk needs a computer. And, I mean, it’s just kinda a coincidence that I work there, but…",7,17,122
Andy," Phyllis, no body is handing anything out.",7,17,122
Andy, What are you gonna play mange on faster?,7,17,122
Andy," It’s crazy, right? Erin just wanted me to have it, so we switched.",7,17,122
Andy," Pam, when I’m freaking out, I just sorta step back and-",7,17,122
Andy," -take a few breaths, and then I ask myself:",7,17,122
Andy, That’s interesting. So you also think my computer is crappy.,7,17,122
Andy, Fine! [the office goes back to their work] Please make sure no one is humping me!,7,17,122
Andy, Well they put a sign-up sheet on the conference room and I signed us up for three mods. A mod is five minutes. And it started two minutes ago.,7,17,122
Andy, Can we talk about this in the meeting? Because we’re a little late.,7,17,122
Andy," Mind if I close the door? [after shutting door in the conference room] What you did out there, earlier, was totally un-cool.",7,17,122
Andy, You humiliated me in front of every body!,7,17,122
Andy, [looks at her knowingly] Pretty sneaky sis. [knocking on conference room door],7,17,122
Andy," [Andy is seen clicking random things and warning boxes pop up. He pours coffee on his keyboard, puts bologna with mustard in his CD drive, and many other computer harming things] Allow all cookies? Why certainly! Pop-ups? Yes please! Bit torrent streaming from a Somalian music website? Yeah! Why not? [mock baby voice] Oh I hope you don’t get sick Mr. Computer. [computer voice] Why are you doing this to me Andy? [normal voice again] Because I hate your programs!  				",7,17,122
Andy," No no no no no! We can say that the previous owner was a neat-freak. Or an elegant old lady and she just kept it around in case her grand-kids came to visit, but they died and they never came, I think I’m gonna make myself cry.",7,17,122
Andy, [watching Pam scrap his computer] That’s probably good. That’s enough.,7,17,122
Andy," [plugging in new computer, acting to make people think he got a bad computer] Pam, how is this thing even any better than my old computer?",7,17,122
Andy," Where’d you even find this thing, like, in the corner in the warehouse?",7,17,122
Andy," All right, well thank you for my garbage computer. [Andy turns it on and looks amazed, clearly happy with it]  				",7,17,122
Andy," Oh my gosh, you have the Dallas board game?",7,18,123
Andy," [playing the Dallas board game] Hmm, I’m gonna play me a little ol’ black mail card .",7,18,123
Andy, And call a proxy meeting to take control of you and oil once and for all.,7,18,123
Andy, Why not. Seems to me we’re just making up rules cause somebody forgot to staple the rules to the inside of the game like a normal human being.,7,18,123
Andy, We must honorably adhere to the rules we are making up on the spot.,7,18,123
Andy," You cant go, you’re dead, I shot you 5 moves ago.",7,18,123
Andy," That exact situation is why I always carry around some of these. [holds up ‘Hello, my name is..,’] nametags. Just in case. Because sometimes you just need to I.D. yourself.",7,19,124
Andy," I wasn’t even trying to make a joke. But I guess I’ve always been sorta quirky, offbeat, a little twisted.  				",7,19,124
Andy, Here we go… ok… what do African Americans call… [laughter],7,19,124
Andy," I don’t mean to go into a rant here, but…  				",7,19,124
Andy," I wrote the perfect joke. Topical, edgy, funny.  				",7,19,124
Andy," …I saw this thing on the news. Democrats want electric cars. Republicans don’t. I’m thinking, ‘how crazy is it that we have a car debate going on in a city known for gridlock.",7,19,124
Andy, [leans on table] I wasn’t taking a position. It’s just one of those things where- [table collapses under Andy],7,19,124
Andy," Yeah, right, I mean- [walks into door, jokingly]  				",7,19,124
Andy," [mimes using a rope to pull himself forward to microwave] Let’s see if they have my favorite teas in here… [throws tea packets into air, puts hand in unplugged toaster, pretends to be shocked, takes container of cheese-puffs and throws them into air, pours hot coffee on his pants]",7,19,124
Andy, Why don’t you think of hosting the Dundies like you’re just running a meeting.,7,20,125
Andy," A lot of people I’d like to thank, but I think we all actually wanna thank you Michael.",7,20,125
Andy," I mean, we actually all really wanna thank you, for everything.",7,20,125
Andy," [singing] Nine million, nine hundred eighty six thousand minutes! We actually sat down, and did the math.",7,20,125
Andy, You know I’m the worst salesman here right?,7,21,126
Andy," I just lost Porter Hardware! I just, I lost ’em!",7,21,126
Andy," [walking into the kitchen, DeAngelo is using the coffee machine to cook chicken covered in melted chocolate] Hey.",7,21,126
Andy, I’m going to be dropping out on one of our biggest clients this afternoon and I could use some back up.,7,21,126
Andy, I thought we’d just talk about our customer service and exceptional paper quality.,7,21,126
Andy," Uh DeAngelo, I’m, uh. I forgot my bag, so I’ll meet you in the car.",7,21,126
Andy," [walks into the client’s office again] Sir, I’d just like to apologize, for that. I could tell you that he has a steel plate in his head, or that he’s crazy, but the truth is I think he’s just a terrible salesman. And I want you to know, that if you re-up with us, anything you need, day or night, I will be the one to take your call.",7,21,126
Andy, [laughing] Hey! [they hug] Good job boss!,7,21,126
Andy," Oh, there’s an inner circle.  Oh yeah.  				",7,22,127
Andy," I gotcha covered, boss.  Used to play with the parabolas myself. [opens desk drawer and takes out balls]  Got some extra balls!  [throws them toward Deangelo, who dodges them]  Hey-hey-hey-ho!",7,22,127
Andy," Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I think if he was sexist, I’d be able to tell.  I took a crapload of women’s studies courses at Cornell.  And I wrote my own companion piece to the “Vagina Monologues” called the “Penis Apologies.”  So I know a thing or two.",7,22,127
Andy, How could I not see it?  You’re so right.,7,22,127
Andy," And if he doesn’t listen, then he can kiss his penis goodbye.  Snip snip.  Am I right, girls?  				",7,22,127
Andy," I’m going in, into the belly of the beast.  Gonna infiltrate and change from within.  [joins the group in Deangelo’s office]  What’s up, mancave! [makes barking noises]",7,22,127
Andy," Okay, I do not want to waste your time, so I will keep this br-r-r-r-r-r-ief.  Now, word on the street is, Mercy Hospital, back on the market.  Deangelo would like you to put together a sales pitch for next week.  Deangelo has also recently learned about the Barnacle Project.  Which is a non-profit organization based in Mystic, Connecticut that assists in the scraping of barnacles —  				",7,22,127
Andy," In fairness, Darryl did tell me that joke, so…",7,23,128
Andy, Sure. What’s going on? [in room with Gabe],7,23,128
Andy," Yeah, fine, I promise. We’ll never date again. Can we go outside now?",7,23,128
Andy," Pam, I have to show you this video. You’re gonna love it. It’s Beyonce falling with a fart mixed in. [buzzer to indicate a blocked web site]  				",7,23,128
Andy," Dwight, guns make me really uncomfortable. ",7,23,128
Andy, [trying to find a pitch] Eeeeeeee… There’s like this crazy ringing going on. I can’t – eeeeeee… I can’t find perfect C. ,7,23,128
Andy, [scatting off-key] Something’s definitely wrong.,7,23,128
Andy," Thank you, Darryl. [Andy limps out of his chair and leans on Darryl for support]",7,23,128
Andy," Well, I burst my eardrum. Doctor said it could take weeks to heal.",7,23,128
Andy, Temporary deafness in one ear. It was both ears. I couldn’t hear a thing Darryl was saying while we were in the waiting room.  				,7,23,128
Andy," Did I say that earlier? Yes, I did. Because you, Gabe, were crying…",7,23,128
Andy, And sobbing uncontrollably. Yes. Uh-huh. You were in hysterics. And my maternal instincts kicked in. Is it actually how I feel? Yes. Or no. That is… between me and my diary.  				,7,23,128
Andy,  [puts up a poster in the break room with “IF YOU ARE ON THE SEARCH COMMITTEE PLEASE CONSIDER ANDY” on it in bold lettering],7,24,129
Andy,"  The manager job? Nah, I’m barely interested. I just can’t not go for it. You know, it’s not the Bernard way. We give it the old college try, and then, in defeat, we show grace.",7,24,129
Andy,  Don’t even… [getting really happy and excited] EEEHHHH!!!!,7,24,129
Andy,"  In my family, you don’t really go out and get things. If you want something, you write it on a list, and then the housekeeper goes out and gets it, on Wednesdays and Fridays. So, I don’t know, I guess you could say this job is on my list, and… [awkwardly smiling] we’ll see what Rosa comes back with.  				",7,24,129
Andy,"  [Jim points at Darryl to be the next interviewee] Good luck, Darryl. ",7,24,129
Andy,"  Okay, guys, it’s time. It’s pep talk time. Tell me what I need to hear.",7,24,129
Andy,"  For starters, I really think we can streamline communication around here… [gets cut off by Gabe]",7,24,129
Andy,"  Right! I really wasn’t trying to insult any, anyone.",7,24,129
Andy,  Okay. Let me think… are you counting car windows?,7,24,129
Andy,"  Yeah! And the diameter of the Sun is 870,000 miles, which makes it 109 times wider than the Earth, and… [Gabe looks visibily annoyed] 333,000 times heavier than the Earth,…",7,24,129
Andy,"  [alone in his car] I am unhappy with the confusing and, at times, confrontational nature of that meeting. I wanted it to go better. I WANTED IT TO GO BETTER!!  				",7,24,129
Andy, Where’d you learn how to puppet like that?,7,24,129
Andy,"  Listen, I’m really flattered, but I don’t think we should.  				",7,24,129
Andy,"  Erin’s my best friend in this office, hands down, but… when she asked me out, I just didn’t have that feeling, you know? [clip jumps ahead] Aren’t there some things that you really want to like, but you just can’t… seem to like it, like, Mad Men… or football… [clips jumps ahead] Let’s not forget, Erin chose Gabe over me. That happened. I’m not going to apologize for getting over her, okay? I’m sorry. [clip jumps ahead] I would go for someone who’s more… she’s great, though.  				",7,24,129
Andy,"  Who do you like for the job? Is there anyone who maybe was a little underwhelming at first, but now seems like a safe, if not slightly unexciting, choice?",7,24,129
Andy,"  Whoever it is, I think they should be lame. [Stanley shakes his head and rolls his eyes] Kind a a non-threatening, moderate personality.",7,24,129
Andy,  She may have a point there… would a small penis work? Small-to-moderate.,7,24,129
Andy,"  [stands up] Uh, listen up. Listen up, ladies. I want the job. There, I said it. I’m educated. I’m capable. I like all of you… and I won’t make any changes.",7,24,129
Andy,  Sometimes you hear about people failing upwards. I think I’m about to do that.  				,7,24,129
Angela, I bet it’s gonna be me. Probably gonna be me.,1,1,1
Angela, You let him walk all over you. It’s just pathetic.,1,3,3
Angela, I think green is kind of whoreish.  				,1,4,4
Angela," Has anyone seen the first-aid kit? [Dwight holds the kit up] How many times have I told you? I’m the safety officer, not you.  				",1,5,5
Angela, I don’t like to necessarily touch things. I’m just… I’m shopping. ,1,6,6
Angela, I hate them. You send me these filthy emails and you say forward them to ten people or you’ll have bad luck.,2,2,9
Angela, I do play games. I sing and I dangle things in front of my cats. I play lots of games. Just not at work.   					,2,3,10
Angela, I call it Pam Pong. I count how many times Jim gets up from his desk and goes to reception to talk to you. ,2,3,10
Angela, Arms at your sides! Arms at your sides!,2,4,11
Angela, I would take The DaVinci Code… so I could burn The DaVinci Code. ,2,4,11
Angela," You know, I don’t know. We put them all up last night.",2,5,12
Angela," Well, I looked through all the budgets. And there is one department… ",2,5,12
Angela, … doing the work that could be done by two.,2,5,12
Angela, I’m just trying to figure out why you’re sabotaging things.,2,5,12
Angela, And I made cookies. Same category.  				,2,5,12
Angela, [watching nearly everyone leave] What about the Halloween party?  				,2,5,12
Angela, Have you signed the expense reports yet?,2,6,13
Angela, I actually look forward to performance reviews.  I did the youth beauty pageant circuit.  And I enjoyed that quite a bit.  I really enjoy being judged.  I believe I hold up very well to even severe scrutiny.   				,2,8,15
Angela, Don’t talk about it.  Office romances are nobody’s business but the people involved.,2,8,15
Angela, Hmm… [Pam reaches towards vending machine] Excuse me.,2,9,16
Angela, I think it’s alright. Jesus drank wine. [Pam overhears],2,9,16
Angela," Is there anything we’re missing? Phyllis, you got the lights?",2,10,17
Angela, [having trouble with a plastic tablecloth as Pam stands idly by] Will you help me?  				,2,10,17
Angela, Michael should have asked the party planning committee first. He’s not supposed to just spring things on us out of nowhere. [starts to cry]  				,2,10,17
Angela, I’ll take the poster. Some people like these.,2,10,17
Angela, What is wrong with you? [Dwight pats Angela on the rear and runs away laughing],2,12,19
Angela," He needs to go right now, and you’re his emergency contact.  I think that you should go with him.",2,12,19
Angela, I agree it’s unacceptable. [longing look],2,13,20
Angela," It’s nobody’s business, Phyllis. Roy.  				",2,13,20
Angela, We haven’t finished getting things in order from your last visit.  ,2,14,21
Angela," I’m not gaining anything from this seminar. I’m a professional woman. The head of accounting. I’m in the healthiest relationship of my life. I just think it’s insulting that Jan thinks we need this. And, apparently, judging from her outfit, Jan aspires to be a whore.  				",2,15,22
Angela," At least you don’t have kids. You have no kids, right? Thank God.",2,15,22
Angela," Really? I wouldn’t know anything about that, but I’m glad you enjoyed it.",2,16,23
Angela, I didn’t get anything for Valentine’s Day.,2,16,23
Angela, [coughs] [sniffles] I am just feeling under the weather. And… I think that I will go home and rest.,2,17,24
Angela," Well, I’ve seen you take enough for the both of us.  					",2,17,24
Angela," No. Thanks. We’d… have to explain everything, it’s probably just easier if we do it ourselves.",2,18,25
Angela," I guess I wouldn’t mind a pair of small, well-behaved boys. ",2,18,25
Angela," You know, I never misbehaved in front of my father because he was a very strict disciplinarian. I can only hope my mate has some of those same qualities [makes eye contact with Dwight].  					",2,18,25
Angela," One thirty. [Pam yawns] I’m sorry, are we boring you?",2,19,26
Angela, No. This is a closed door meeting.   					,2,19,26
Angela," You don’t know it’s going to be okay. Don’t give him false hope. …It’s probably nothing, though.  					",2,19,26
Angela, What are— it’s… the party planning committee.,2,19,26
Angela, Yes… [whispering] but don’t expect any cookie.,2,19,26
Angela, No one cares about your birthday. Kevin’s waiting to hear if he has skin cancer.,2,19,26
Angela, Do you want to give Michael your urine? ,2,20,27
Angela, You’re not going to get my permission on this. ,2,20,27
Angela, Can we just skip to whatever number 5 is – win/win or whatever?,2,21,28
Angela," I got this poster for Christmas, and I feel I want to see it everyday. It makes me feel like the babies are the true artists, and God has a really cute sense of humor.",2,21,28
Angela," It was hand delivered. But, I did get a Save The Date after all. It’s not my taste.  					",2,21,28
Angela," You have to pick an approved, non-profit organization.  				",2,22,29
Angela," We are giving money that has been gambled. Why don’t we just deal drugs or prostitute ourselves,  and donate that money to charity?  				",2,22,29
Angela, [in reference to Oscar being gay] It explains so much.  					,3,1,31
Angela,"  Sure, sometimes I watch Will and Grace… and I want to throw up.  It’s terribly loud.  I do like it sometimes when Harry Connick Jr. is on.  He’s so talented.  					",3,1,31
Angela, But I don’t understand. It’s for managers.,3,2,32
Angela, I know! It… I was just really hoping we could spend some time together. [A long silence.] Are you still there?,3,2,32
Angela," Don’t “Monkey” me! You can’t wait to get out of here, A. R. M.  ",3,2,32
Angela," In the Martin family, we like to say, “Looks like someone took the slow train from Philly.” That’s code for “check out the slut.” What is… why are there flies in here?  ",3,2,32
Angela," That was for per diem, for Philadelphia.",3,2,32
Angela, Is there a key for Jane Doe? Thank you.,3,2,32
Angela, [walking past Dwight’s desk] Kitchen.  ,3,3,33
Angela," Michael is going to get us all fired.  You sat back and let him play that dumb movie, and now Jan is peeved off and we’re all going to lose our jobs.",3,3,33
Angela," Dwight, you should be running this office.",3,3,33
Angela," It’s not up to Michael, it’s Jan’s call. Talk to her.",3,3,33
Angela, Fine!  Sit back and do nothing and let us all get fired!  ,3,3,33
Angela," I know that patience and loyalty are good, and virtuous traits.  But sometimes I just think you need to grow a pair.  ",3,3,33
Angela, You alone?  Because I thought together we could—,3,3,33
Angela, We really have a lot of work to do right now.,3,4,34
Angela, A dead bird should not be in the kitchen!,3,4,34
Angela," He’s not weird, he’s just individualistic. ",3,5,35
Angela, [points at picture on the wall] And that blue busty gal? What’s her story?,3,6,36
Angela," Well, whatever Kelly wants to do in her own house is fine but we shouldn’t all be subjected to it.",3,6,36
Angela, I wish some of us still had our shoes on.,3,6,36
Angela, I’ll just have some bread. You used your hands.  					,3,6,36
Angela, Dry. You look like you were having fun.,3,6,36
Angela, I have to watch our shoes so they don’t get stolen. Who were you texting?,3,6,36
Angela," What about us, Michael? Do we still have jobs?",3,7,37
Angela, I don’t want to blame anyone in particular. I think everyone’s to blame.  				,3,7,37
Angela, I don’t want to go all the way to Dunmore.,3,7,37
Angela, Maybe that’s because some people treat it like their own private Hooters strip club. ,3,8,38
Angela," Jan, this is Angela Martin from accounting.",3,9,39
Angela," Look, we have a rebate from… the Federal Work Opportunity Program and no one knows what that means. ",3,9,39
Angela, One of the Stamford people is a criminal? ,3,9,39
Angela," Jan, which one of the new employees is a criminal?",3,9,39
Angela," Sure. Let’s protect the convicts. At the expense of the general feeling of safety in the workplace. As a 90-pound female that sits in an ill-lit, rarely-visited corner of the office, naturally I agree with that.",3,9,39
Angela, Do you really expect us to believe you’re somebody else?,3,9,39
Angela," Phyllis, I need you to pick up green streamers at lunch.",3,10,40
Angela, These are all terrible ideas and none of them are on the theme of “A Nutcracker Christmas.” I think you should leave.,3,10,40
Angela," You tried this out, and it’s clearly not for you. It’s time to go. Come on. [Angela gets up from seat] Please. [Karen gets up and leaves] Thank you. OK, thank you very much. [Angela closes door]  					",3,10,40
Angela, This should’ve been up yesterday. [refers to party flyer],3,10,40
Angela, [Pam puts up another flyer] What is that? [Reads flyer] The “Committee to Plan Parties invites you to a margarita-karaoke Christmas?” There’s no such thing as the “Committee to Plan Parties.” ,3,10,40
Angela," Well, you just can’t start a committee. You have to have funding. ",3,10,40
Angela," No, that is not a party. There’s only one party and it’s hosted by the Party PLANNING Committee and it starts at three o’clock. ",3,10,40
Angela," Pam, don’t tell her what to do! Phyllis.",3,10,40
Angela, I have a very important announcement to make… about… your paychecks. Umm… Your paychecks will be arriving as scheduled on Friday. And they will be in the correct amount that they are normally in… Please stand by for a very important announcement… refer..[starts to leave office] for further regarding your paycheck! [runs outside]  					,3,10,40
Angela, [on cell phone to Dwight] I need to know if I can start the party?,3,10,40
Angela, Did Michael give you permission to do this?,3,10,40
Angela," [Angela slams phone shut and runs back to office.] Also, I would like to inform you that, um, as a special treat, my party will be starting early. In fact, it will be starting right now [opens door to conference room.]",3,10,40
Angela, Welcome Hannah. You will not be disappointed.,3,10,40
Angela, I said you wouldn’t be disappointed. [Meredith heads towards break room.],3,10,40
Angela," Meredith, if you don’t come to my party, you will be very, very sorry.",3,10,40
Angela, Brownies. Cupcakes. [Kevin walks toward conference room],3,10,40
Angela," I don’t back down. My sister and I used to be best friends, and we haven’t talked in 16 years. Over some disagreement, I don’t even remember. So… yeah. I’m pretty good.  					",3,10,40
Angela, Try harder then. [Hannah smashes Nutcracker on top of nut. Sees Kevin take another brownie] Uh uh. No one has seconds until everyone’s had some. ,3,10,40
Angela, You’ve got to be kidding. {Kevin takes bite of brownie]  					,3,10,40
Angela," Hey, excuse me! Waitress lady! Hey, where do you think you’re going with that? [refers to toy she just took from table] ",3,10,40
Angela, You can’t have it [takes back toy] I don’t walk into your house and steal your Hello Kitty backpack.,3,10,40
Angela, I’ve had the worse day here [turns up Nutcracker music on the stereo. [Sighs. Dwight reaches for and holds Angela’s hand],3,10,40
Angela, I’m not sure. Does your karaoke machine have Christmas songs? ,3,10,40
Angela," Oh, I may have seen it somewhere. [Goes to plant and picks up power cord] Is it this one?",3,10,40
Angela," [into another walkie-talkie] Copy, Possum. What’s your twenty?  					",3,10,40
Angela," [singing, with Dwight holding up microphone] Little baby, parum pum pum pum. I am a poor boy too, parum pum pum pum. I have no gift to bring, parum pum pum pum. That’s fit to give our King, parum pum pum pum..  					",3,10,40
Angela," [singing] … Shall I play for you, parum pum pum pum [Oscar and Gil walk through door]",3,10,40
Angela," [singing] I played my drum for Him, parum pum pum pum. I played my best for Him, parum pum pum pum, Rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum.",3,10,40
Angela, By the end of the day? That’s impossible. ,3,11,41
Angela," Michael, there’s no way we can do it in time.  ",3,11,41
Angela," OK, we only have three hours people to plan a whole luau, and you’re not helping.",3,11,41
Angela,  Everything ok? [Takes candy from Pam’s desk],3,12,42
Angela, Thank you. [Puts candy back] I… I don’t want those.  				,3,12,42
Angela, Hey Pam. Would you like to go with me to grab a coffee?,3,12,42
Angela," Yeah, I could use some fresh air. Might be fun. ",3,12,42
Angela, This friend of mine – let’s call her Noelle – she missed this deadline turning something in to Corporate in New York. But then this gallant gentleman – we’ll call him Kurt – he drove all the way to New York and handed it in for her. That’s… I don’t know. I guess he really just likes her a lot. ,3,12,42
Angela," Yes, it is. [Walks up to the counter where there is no employee] Hello?  				",3,12,42
Angela, That’s great Pam. I like having these little moments with you. You know what? Sprinkles recently had kittens.,3,12,42
Angela, I would like to offer you the dominant male. His name is Ash.,3,12,42
Angela," How is going to be ok, Dwight? Everyone will know our business.",3,12,42
Angela, I hate those two people more than anything in the entire world. ,3,12,42
Angela," Dwight, from sales, was one of the most honorable and efficient employees this company has ever had.   				",3,12,42
Angela, Oscar? I have a question. Would you like to join the party planning committee?,3,13,43
Angela, No. No. Certain events have transpired. And I’ve thought about certain things. And I’m sorry for the way those certain events transpired. [starts to cry] And I would just like to make some changes about certain things and certain situations.,3,13,43
Angela," I wanted to let you know that Dwight was late that morning because he was driving to New York to drop off the correlated documents that I forgot to send. Though to be fair, Kevin never reminded me.",3,13,43
Angela, Nothing.  You know this is a luncheon shower.  Girls only.,3,14,44
Angela, Under no circumstance should a man strip off his clothes in this office.,3,14,44
Angela, Thank you. Don’t linger. Break left. Left!  					,3,15,45
Angela," Congratulations, Phyllis. You look lovely. Your dress is very white. So white, my eyes are burning.",3,15,45
Angela, [on ground] … Please don’t let that stupid thing near me…   				,3,16,46
Angela, Poop is raining from the ceilings. Poop!  				,3,16,46
Angela, [flustered] Well… good for Dwight.  				,3,18,48
Angela," What happened, exactly?  I wasn’t here, so I haven’t really heard the whole story.",3,18,48
Angela, Then what’d he do? [Kelly’s phone rings],3,18,48
Angela, Dwight.  Dwight.  I’ve been doing some very interesting reading.,3,18,48
Angela," Mm-hmm.  I was thinking tonight, we could… read it together.",3,18,48
Angela, [getting a pill from the bottle] I don’t have a headache.  I’m just preparing.  				,3,20,50
Angela, Can you just tell us what we need to do so we can go?,3,20,50
Angela," [on phone] Excuse me?  Well, I don’t see how that’s our fault.  And I’ve already told you, the official position of Dunder Mifflin is apologetic, so I don’t know what you want from me. [hangs up]",3,20,50
Angela, [on phone] Where are you from?  Ohio?  That’s nice.  So what do you want?  [to Kelly] He’s upset about the watermark.,3,20,50
Angela, [on phone] It was an unfortunate error.  ,3,20,50
Angela," …and the company has already apologized, so you can take that apology or not. [hangs up] [to Kelly] I think he had Tourette’s or something!  				",3,20,50
Angela," Yeah, well you didn’t know that when you filled out this payroll form.",3,20,50
Angela," And when we get mad, you always ask us if we’re on our periods.",3,21,51
Angela, Malls are just awful and humiliating. They’re just store after store of these horrible salespeople making a big fuss out of an adult shopping in a junior’s section. There are petite adults who are sort of… smaller who need to wear… maybe a kids’ size 10.  				,3,21,51
Angela," Meredith, slow down! We’re not gonna get there any faster if we’re dead.",3,21,51
Angela, OK. I’m gonna be at the doll store.  				,3,21,51
Angela," Sometimes, the clothes at GapKids are just too flashy. So I’m forced to go to the American Girl store and order clothes for large colonial dolls.  				",3,21,51
Angela, [in the car] Slower. Slower. Meredith. [Michael’s cell phone ringing My Humps] Slow it up.,3,21,51
Angela, What? What are you saying? Did you say sandwich? ,3,22,52
Angela, I knew you were saying sabotage.  I was giving you an example of it. I will misunderstand everything that Andy says until he goes insane.,3,22,52
Angela," What, Andy?  Andy, what should I tell them? ",3,22,52
Angela, I don’t understand what you want from me. ,3,22,52
Angela, I’m not going to talk through the fire after your disgusting feet have gone through.,3,22,52
Angela, But you said you were in debt. [crosstalk],3,23,53
Angela," No Dwight, I don’t care if that is how they consolidated power in ancient Rome. ",3,23,53
Angela," [smiles] Not now. [Dwight leaves] Goodbye, Kelly Kapoor.   				",3,23,53
Angela, How can she make you get back together with her? ,3,23,53
Angela," She’s been sick for some time. Thank you for asking, no one asks… about Sprinkles.  				",4,1,55
Angela," I have to give her her meds, I have to pet her, and who will she eat lunch with?",4,1,55
Angela," There’s bad blood, jealousies, cliques.",4,1,55
Angela, Can you do me a little favor? Go to my place at lunch and give Sprinkles her medicine.,4,1,55
Angela," There’s a diabetes shot, roll the insulin in your hand, don’t shake it. She gets an ace inhibitor with her meal, but you have to put her right in front of the dish or she won’t see it because of the cataracts. Mix one capsule of omega fatty acid in with her kidney medicine, um… and you want to give that to her 15 minutes after she’s eaten. And, oh and there’s a fungal cream because she has this infection under her tail, so you’re gonna have to lift her tail and put the cream right at the base of her tail.  				",4,1,55
Angela," No, that’s not. That’s next to cleanliness.",4,1,55
Angela, Uh-huh. But I thought she had more time.,4,1,55
Angela, Did she look… When you saw her how was she looking?,4,1,55
Angela, Sprinkles never hurt a soul. God in your infinite wisdom how could you do this? She wasn’t ready. She had so much left to accomplish.,4,1,55
Angela," This is Sprinkles. [holds up a picture] She was my best friend. I kept her going through countless ailments. I asked Dwight Schrute to feed her once, and she is now deceased. This is Halloween last year, [picture of Angela holding Sprinkles] just a couple of kittens [starts to cry] out on the town.  				",4,1,55
Angela," Pssst. I’m having relationship problems. And since you’re always having relationship problems, I thought you’d be able to give me some advice.",4,1,55
Angela," I have this crazy thought, that I know is crazy. That maybe Dwight killed my cat.",4,1,55
Angela," When I got home, Sprinkles’ body was in the freezer where Dwight said he left her, but all my bags of frozen french fries had been clawed to shreds.",4,1,55
Angela, Something’s not right. The vet’s doing an autopsy.,4,1,55
Angela, [pushes her chair into Dwight’s legs] I’m not depressed I’m in grief.  				,4,1,55
Angela, The vet is removing all of Sprinkles organs right now and sending them to the lab.,4,1,55
Angela, Well then she barfed them up in the freezer and tried to get out.,4,1,55
Angela, How could you do that without telling me?,4,1,55
Angela," Cat Heaven is a beautiful place, but you don’t get there if you’re euthanized.",4,1,55
Angela, Don’t touch me Dwight! [runs off crying]  				,4,1,55
Angela," [to everyone in the room] For the record, I have never been involved with anyone at work, in any capacity.",4,2,56
Angela, It’s not a surprise to me. Pam is the office mattress.  				,4,2,56
Angela, I can’t believe you just thought you could replace Sprinkles. Before she’s even in the ground.,4,2,56
Angela, I don’t want Garbage! I want Sprinkles! [walks away]  				,4,2,56
Angela," Hello, Dwight. I’ve been thinking about things and I wanted to know if you would have dinner with me tonight?",4,2,56
Angela, I would prefer a public place. See you after work.  				,4,2,56
Angela, I can’t do this. I can’t be with you. Every time I look in your eyes I see Sprinkles’ stiff lifeless body.,4,2,56
Angela, I’m sorry. I gave this everything I could.,4,2,56
Angela, I will leave your toothbrush on top of your tire tomorrow morning. [gets up and leaves restaurant]  				,4,2,56
Angela,  Waste of time.  The website’s going to win.,4,3,57
Angela,"  I won’t be watching, and I won’t.  				",4,3,57
Angela,  Lunch party?  It’s supposed to say launch party!  What is wrong with you?  				,4,3,57
Angela,  I feel angry.  Angry at you.  Angry at you for doing something stupid.  Angry at me for believing you could do something not stupid.,4,3,57
Angela,  It is awful.  You’ve made this day awful!,4,3,57
Angela,"  Then it would say lanch party, Kevin.  Would it really be better if it said lanch party?",4,3,57
Angela,"  Plan a party, Angela.  Oh!  And the entire world will see it.  Oh!  And here’s $65.00 for your budget.  Oh and here are four idiots who’ll do nothing but weigh you down.  Oh. And your cat’s still dead.  				",4,3,57
Angela,  I asked for assorted cutlery and I got back spoons.  These are worthless.,4,3,57
Angela,"  Phyllis.  These are spoooons.  Spoons have rounded tops, and are used to scoop things.  What we need are forks, which have prongs, or tiny spears on top.  And we need knives, which have blades.  Do you understand me now?",4,3,57
Angela,  Because there’s a party! A party for the website I’ve been planning for two weeks.,4,3,57
Angela,"  How do you tell someone it’s over?  You send them a notarized letter, right?  Well, what if the recipient is your notary?  				",4,3,57
Angela,  Hey.  Do you have any men that you can fix me up with?  I would like to have a relationship with a man.,4,3,57
Angela,"  Beer, lite beer, streamers, orchids. Better lighting?  ",4,3,57
Angela,"  Pizza, pizza with mushrooms, pizza without mushrooms, white pizza, steak?",4,3,57
Angela, It should take no time at all if you put the care into it that you normally do.,4,3,57
Angela," I have been working on a party for three weeks that just got thrown out the window.  So now I’ve got to pull together a whole new party, and my useless number two quit, so now there’s no one in charge of orchids, chocolates, or the thing that’s made of ice.  And my upper back itches, and it’s itched all day, and I can’t reach it, and Kevin had Greek food for lunch again.  				",4,3,57
Angela," I needed another hour, it could have been done in another hour.",4,3,57
Angela, That’s why you’re not in charge Meredith.,4,3,57
Angela, I have to go clean up after the party.  				,4,3,57
Angela," No I left it on my night table— your night table, by the lamp.",4,4,58
Angela," [to Andy] You may ask me out to dinner. Nothing fancy or foreign, no bars, no patios, no vegetables, and no seafood.   ",4,4,58
Angela, I find the mystery genre disgusting. I hate being titillated.  				,4,5,59
Angela," Jim, we need to order a cake for Creed’s birthday. ",4,7,61
Angela, It’s birthday month. Creed’s is today. Oscar’s is week after next. Meredith’s is at the end of the month. [Jim exhales deeply] Michael usually goes with red and white streamers…,4,7,61
Angela," No. No way. I am not a machine, Jim. You can’t just change plans willy nilly and expect these little magic party elves to do your bidding. We already have devils food, peach cobbler, Fudgie the Whale, mushroom caps.",4,7,61
Angela, What am I supposed to do with two cakes and a pie?’,4,7,61
Angela,"  Well, that was the last time, Dwight. I mean it.",5,1,63
Angela,"  No, no. I have a fiance I very much like!  				",5,1,63
Angela,"  Listen, dummy! It’s not that hard. All you have to do is take the numbers from the sales report and type them into a master spreadsheet. A G.D. monkey could do it. I do not understand why you can’t do it.",5,1,63
Angela,  Dangerous. Tacky. Sharks. Haunted. No.  				,5,1,63
Angela,"  [walking into storage room] Hurry, we have to make this fast.",5,1,63
Angela,"  I have a nice comforter and several cozy pillows. I usually read a chapter of a book, and it’s lights out by 8:30. That’s how I sleep at night!  				",5,1,63
Angela,  No. My doctor wants me to gain weight.,5,1,63
Angela,"  That is very important to me, so — I have work to do. Just do it. [walks away]",5,1,63
Angela,"  I know I haven’t made this easy on you. [Dwight comes out of storage room alone, looks at watch.]  				",5,1,63
Angela,  I hate to even ask because you have been so accommodating about all the wedding stuff.,5,1,63
Angela,"  Is there any way our first dance can be to my favorite song, The Little Drummer Boy?",5,1,63
Angela,  I don’t know if I want your old college a capella group to be our wedding band.,5,1,63
Angela,  [Angela dials the phone] Let’s talk about this later. [Dwight’s pager buzzes],5,1,63
Angela," I once reported Oscar to the INS.  Turns out he’s clean, but I’m glad I did it.",5,2,64
Angela," Per your instructions, we have the personalized M&Ms with the baby names.  This is your boy bowl, with the name “Chevy.” And this is the girl bowl, with M&Ms with the name “Astird.”",5,3,65
Angela, It’s a baby game where you guess whose picture is whose.,5,3,65
Angela," Yeah, it is.  So I hope you two are very happy together.  Pervert.",5,3,65
Angela," Um, we all chipped in and got you this stroller.",5,3,65
Angela," [with Astrid covered in and surrounded by vegetables on a lunch table] That’s good.  Now, I need you to – I need it to look up here.  Get the baby to look up here, ready?",5,3,65
Angela," Yes, that’s correct. I need to cancel checks from 10,001 to 90,000.",5,4,66
Angela, I think you have me confused with another person.,5,4,66
Angela, I heard you. [quickly walks away]  				,5,4,66
Angela, I don’t want to be married in a tent like a hobo,5,6,68
Angela, Nana Mimi can’t be in canvas that long.,5,6,68
Angela," OK fine you can have your tent, but only if it’s in a field, a hand-plowed field",5,6,68
Angela, There has to be a barn that’s old enough that you can see the stars through the roof slats when you lay on your back. And antique tools to look at when you roll over.,5,6,68
Angela, No. But anything within a five- to eight-mile radius is acceptable.,5,6,68
Angela, But my biggest concern is that there’s only one bathroom.,5,9,71
Angela, Nana Mimi cannot squat over some trench.,5,9,71
Angela, Do you have to slaughter on our wedding day?,5,9,71
Angela, I would like cow butter sculpture of a cat.,5,9,71
Angela," [to minister] Hello, I’m Angela Martin, and-",5,9,71
Angela," Dwight, I thought I knew what I wanted. And then, being here with you and the German Mennonite minister… it just all felt right. I made a mistake picking Andy.",5,9,71
Angela, Take this thing. [takes off twine ring],5,9,71
Angela," [kisses Andy passionately in his chair] Now, I have to take care of a legal issue.  				",5,9,71
Angela, I am not going to judge Phyllis for desecrating Christmas.  There is one person who will though and Phyllis just stuffed him into a drawer.    				,5,10,72
Angela, Really Andy? It’s Christmas and your singing about nudity and France.,5,10,72
Angela, I lost it. [Phyllis glares at her until Angela pulls out the hairnet and puts it on],5,10,72
Angela," I’m not moving the tree.  Face it. The only power you have over me is this big secret that I know you’re not going to tell.  And you want to know how I know that? Because then you won’t be able to plan your stupid, tacky parties anymore. So you move the tree.",5,10,72
Angela," Kevin, you screwed this form up again. The amount owed goes at the top.",5,11,73
Angela, That is a terrible idea. One of your worst.,5,11,73
Angela, I’ve already admitted that I do. Why do you keep making me repeat it?,5,11,73
Angela," Andy, I’m engaged to you. I mean, we just signed off on our wedding flowers. Would I have said yes to formal chrysanthemums if I didn’t want to get married? And, we went through all that stuff with our wedding cake…",5,11,73
Angela," I don’t know. I mean, we were together, and then he killed sprinkles, and then we stopped, and… I don’t know exactly when we started up again.",5,11,73
Angela," [quietly] Let me think about it… I, um… there… [Andy looks over to see everyone watching them]",5,11,73
Angela," Andy, we are at a crossroads here. And we can either give in to what people are saying that we’re not good together.",5,11,73
Angela," Or, we can prove them wrong. Let’s prove them wrong.  				",5,11,73
Angela, [thinks for a moment] I will respect the results of the duel.,5,11,73
Angela, [watching from the conference room] I can’t believe they’re gonna fight over me.,5,11,73
Angela," Ok, I wasn’t going to dignify this discussion by getting involved, but I don’t even get the discussion, hot is a temperature people. But Kevin deserves to lose for what he said, so, yes, she’s hot, she’s hot as heck, she’s a female Boris Becker.",5,12,74
Angela, [pulling cat out of filing drawer] It’s okay.  Shh shhh.,5,13,75
Angela, I only weigh 82 pounds!  Uh– save Bandit! [throws cat into air duct and he falls out through the other side] Oh!,5,13,75
Angela, What are you– [people are yelling] What are you doing?,5,13,75
Angela, Oh my God! [Dwight has cut the face off the CPR dummy and put it over his own],5,13,75
Angela," If you ever wondered if you were Michael Scott, here’s a quiz to help. If you ever put sunblock on a window, you might be Michael Scott. [laughter]  				",5,13,75
Angela, I normally don’t enjoy making people laugh. [grin]  				,5,13,75
Angela, If you ever called the fire department ’cause your head was stuck in your chair you might be…,5,13,75
Angela," [enters smiling and waving] Hello, everyone. Oh, ice cream. Nice, Kevin. Looks good.",5,15,77
Angela," I am proud to announce that there is a new addition to the Martin family. [takes a breath, excitedly] She’s hypoallergenic. She doesn’t struggle when you try to dress her. She’s a third-generation show cat. Her father was in ‘Meet the Parents.’ Needless to say, she was very, very expensive.",5,15,77
Angela, He wouldn’t have wanted that. Her name is Princess Lady!,5,15,77
Angela, I have something better than a picture. Come on.  ,5,15,77
Angela," Yeah. [cats meowing] I mean, I usually try to take leave when I get a new cat, but I’m out of vacation days. And this company still doesn’t recognize cat maternity. I mean, when somebody has a kid, oh sure, take off a year.",5,15,77
Angela, Right. Anyways… I just want to make sure Princess Lady is acclimating well. She means more to me than anyone.,5,15,77
Angela," Stop it, Mr. Ash! Bad cat! That is very bad! You stop it right now! I swear, he is fixed.",5,15,77
Angela," No, now listen. You can’t let what you see here, sully your image of them. They are good, decent cats. [all laugh] I gotta go. I’ll be back in an hour. Oh, stop that! Oh!",5,15,77
Angela," [cats meowing in background][on Nanny-Cam] Where is that bad cat? Oh, you know who you are. Excuse me, Petals, I’m looking for Mr. Ash. He’s a bad cat. Bad, bad cat. Do you hear me? Bad. Yeah, you were bad. No, you look at me when I talk to you. Do you hear me, Mr. Ash? You look at me. ‘Cause I’m talking to you right now. ",5,15,77
Angela, [shivers] [meowing noises] Has this been on the entire time?,5,15,77
Angela," [sigh of relief] Well, sorry I’m late. [clears throat, coughs, pulls hairball out of her mouth]  ",5,15,77
Angela," Oh God, what did you do?  I mean, not that I approve of any of it but…",5,16,78
Angela, My worst breakup was actually two breakups.  Two different men. I was in love with both of them and when things went bad they had a duel over me.,5,16,78
Angela," No, this was years ago when I was living in Ohio.   John Mark and John David.",5,16,78
Angela, [to Pam] Did you know a baby conceived out of wedlock is still a bastard?,6,1,81
Angela," But, I do not understand. If we’re such smart adults, then why don’t we get raises?",6,3,83
Angela," Yes. They don’t get ’em, if we don’t get ’em!",6,3,83
Angela, It’s not like we’re not gonna see the checks. We’re in accounting! ,6,3,83
Angela, This is how you make this important decision?,6,3,83
Angela, Decent people everywhere will get offended.,6,4,84
Angela," Well, you’re lucky you have a grandmother. Some of us have to be our own grandmothers.",6,4,84
Angela," Well, why don’t I just save you some time and kick you in the stomach instead?",6,4,84
Angela, Mmm-hmm. Ok. I’ll go with you. Come on.,6,4,84
Angela, Relax.  You’ll get your shot at Jim.  Those two treat the whole office like a 1970’s key party.    				,6,4,84
Angela,  I have some ideas about conservation… ,6,6,86
Angela,  Thank you.  Sure well first of all I think that we could totally… ,6,6,86
Angela,"  I’m sorry, I was told I had the floor.",6,6,86
Angela,"  [in a sing-songy voice] Pam, how’s your day going?  ",6,6,86
Angela," This sounds ridiculous, I know, but some people say that I eat like a squirrel.",6,7,87
Angela,"  Pam, aren’t you going to introduce us to Michael’s girlfriend?",6,8,88
Angela,"  Michael, I don’t like this game.  It’s scary.",6,9,89
Angela,"  Voodoo Mama Juju, the witch doctor of the Savannah swamps.  I’m not comfortable with this. [holds up a head]",6,9,89
Angela," It’s not my fault, I was exposed to Harry Potter.",6,9,89
Angela,"  Hey everyone, Kevin’s going to give us his take on the situation.  Let’s listen up.",6,9,89
Angela," To my tally, you just won back your own parking spot, a vacation day, and a nice, tidy quarter of $1,000 from all of us.",6,11,91
Angela, Are you serious?  This is so offensive.,6,12,92
Angela, I already booked a Great Lakes cruise. ,6,14,94
Angela," [as Andy is passing her a card] No, no!",6,15,95
Angela,  [as Nick looks over at her]  What are you looking at?,6,16,96
Angela,  Hey.  Uh-uh.  I cannot control that.  You can’t put that in here.,6,16,96
Angela,  Have you had a chance to look over the revisions on the contract I’ve prepared for you?,6,16,96
Angela,"  And now you, two forms of ID, please…  Alright, all is in order.  I just need your signature…  What is it?",6,16,96
Angela,  Alright.  How would you like to celebrate?,6,16,96
Angela, Hey! [Erin sneezing at desk] Are you sick?,6,17,97
Angela," Yes, I’m anxious to get off work. But let me be clear. It’s not to celebrate St Patrick’s Day. It’s so I can protest St. Patrick’s Day.  				",6,17,97
Angela, Hm-hm. Do you not answer e-mails anymore? Because I’ve e-mailed you four times asking you to come to my desk.,6,18,98
Angela," Oh, how the tables have turned. I see you got my e-mail.",6,18,98
Angela, I’ll give you the leads. But you know what? It’s going to cost you some clerical work [hands her a mountain of paperwork] ,6,18,98
Angela," It doesn’t matter. Fill them out. All of them. Then when you’re done, you can watch me shred them.   				",6,18,98
Angela, Do you have any pastries without fruit?,6,18,98
Angela,"And then they said the most ridiculous thing about Anderson Cooper, which I do not have the decency to repeat, but trust me when I tell you that-",6,19,99
Angela,You are hereby served with a summons to appear in Lackawanna county court.,6,19,99
Angela,For breach of contract with Angela Noelle Martin. ,6,19,99
Angela,"Dwight recently entered into a contract with me, establishing intent to conceive and raise a child with me. ",6,19,99
Angela,Do you plan on raising a child with me? Or do you plan on breaking this contract?,6,19,99
Angela, You think I want people remembering I had sensual relations with Andy? It’s the kind of thing you wish you could have annulled. I want to throw up just thinking about it.,6,20,100
Angela, You are throwing up for the wrong reasons!,6,20,100
Angela, Angela. [Michael sticks post-it on Angela’s forehead with female genitalia] Michael.,6,21,101
Angela, I knew it. You should see their baby.   				,6,21,101
Angela,  Is this the thing where they use an icicle so there’s no evidence?,6,23,103
Angela,"  Rather than spend all day in court, we’ve decided to settle our dispute using a mediator. It was an option spelled out in our childrearing contract. ",6,23,103
Angela,  Alleged? I’m going to own your farm by the time this is over.,6,23,103
Angela,  I’m doing it. You know I am. It’s disgusting.,6,23,103
Angela,"  Dwight, look at my teeth. [shows teeth, beet red]",6,23,103
Angela,  He has a 60-acre beet farm that is worth a small fortune.,6,23,103
Angela,"  Well, I have an alternative.[hands Dwight a document]",6,23,103
Angela,"  Those lumps are cats, and those cats have names, and those names are Ember, Milky Way, Diane, and Lumpy.",6,23,103
Angela,  I’m not some farm animal. [Dwight smirks at the camera]  				,6,23,103
Angela,  What did you do to yourself? [camera pans to Jim and Pam laying down in restful location],6,23,103
Angela," Oh, did you see this report that the zoo got a baby otter? It’s on the same site! ",6,24,104
Angela," Everybody knows it was Andy, and it is not fair for us all to take the fall for his big stupid mouth!",6,24,104
Angela, [closing door] I said I didn’t want to be on the internet!,7,1,106
Angela, I came down here to feed the feral cats like I usually do and I found something unsavory in the back of your nephew’s car. ,7,1,106
Angela,  My place tonight. Wear this. [motioning to his new outfit],7,2,107
Angela," Listen, I would like you to take me to Andy’s play tonight. ",7,3,108
Angela," No. If you want to punch the punch card, you have to take me to the show. ",7,3,108
Angela," Well, there’s a lot of gray area in that clause.  Do you want to re-mediate?",7,3,108
Angela," Dwight and I have a contractual agreement to procreate five times, plain and simple. And should he develop feelings for me, well, that would be permissible under item 7C, clause 2, so I would not object. [faint smile]  				",7,3,108
Angela, [after taking her gum out] Ugh! There’s gum on the seat and now it’s on my work skirt. I have to go change.,7,3,108
Angela, These are just my dirty old gardening clothes. They were all that I had in my car.,7,3,108
Angela, That was more horrifying than Nunsense. ,7,3,108
Angela,"  No, actually, Dwight, I didn’t realize how far this walk was, and I-I’m exhausted.",7,3,108
Angela," No, no, no, no. I think I just want to go home, but it’s okay. This can count as one of your times.",7,3,108
Angela, [seeing the worker Dwight picked up in the parking lot] Who’s this guy by our cars?,7,4,109
Angela, This is what you get when you treat your body like an outhouse.,7,4,109
Angela," KELLY! You cannot change costumes in the middle of the day! Pam, she’s out.",7,6,111
Angela," This is an amazing prize. I mean, I don’t even want to give Pam a compliment, because she’s so blegh, but she did a good job. I really want that coupon book.  				",7,6,111
Angela," I don’t like your tone! Look, they were sold out of all the other costumes, okay? I think we all live in the real world, here. Let’s not pretend to be unaware of what sells in this office.  				",7,6,111
Angela," Jim. Pam. [gasps, speaks in baby voice] And the precious bundle of God’s gift to everything. [back to her normal voice] I wish you both a pleasant day. [baby voice] And you too. Yes. Praise God. Ok.  				",7,7,112
Angela, Jesus is not your caterer. [baby voice to Cece] But he should be your caterer ’cause you’re a little angel. Why didn’t your parents get you a caterer? [normal voice] They don’t think.,7,7,112
Angela, [as Kevin runs to grab her] What are you doing?,7,7,112
Angela," Just say copies, why do you have to drag cats into this.",7,8,113
Angela, [whispers in Dwight’s ear] Outside my car in two minutes.,7,8,113
Angela," Ok, uhm, then tell him that we’ll do this tomorrow night instead.",7,8,113
Angela," Wait Pam! How did he seem? Like, you know, did he seem disappointed?",7,8,113
Angela," Hey, I’m kind of in the mood for a roll in the hay.",7,9,114
Angela," You met your commission cap last week. So from here until the end of the fiscal year, your commission will be zero. ",7,9,114
Angela," [waiting for Dwight at their meeting place, slams the door shut]  ",7,9,114
Angela, Where have you been?! I’ve been waiting. ,7,9,114
Angela," No, I–I think you should make time for it. ",7,9,114
Angela," Yeah, instead of Hay Place, it should be pay place. [man laughs] Don’t laugh at me.",7,9,114
Angela," Mm. Yeah, so we can celebrate Thanksgiving-Me-Your-Money Day. [both laugh]",7,9,114
Angela," You would. And if I were to call your house and ask for your wife, would I get through to you?",7,9,114
Angela," [lights turn off] Really? [jumps to try and activate motion sensor, Kevin walks through the door setting it off, and the lights come back on]  				",7,10,115
Angela, I wouldn’t subject Robert to that. He’s a very busy senator.,7,11,116
Angela, I would not expect you to know what it’s like to date someone in the public arena.,7,11,116
Angela, We went to a picnic thrown by the Comptroller’s wife.,7,11,116
Angela," Do you have any idea how many photographers there are at a ribbon-cutting ceremony. I do. Two. “Angela…” [imitates camera shooting] “over here, Angela…” [imitates camera shooting] “here. Look here!”  				",7,11,116
Angela, Just stop moving your calves so much while you’re talking.,7,11,116
Angela, Maybe I’ll bring my boyfriend. I’ll invite him.,7,11,116
Angela," I mean, unless there’s any chance there could be press at this party.",7,11,116
Angela," Well, I only ask because he’s a senator.",7,11,116
Angela," No, it really seems like something Michael would do.",7,11,116
Angela," Hey everybody, this is my boyfriend, Senator Robert Lipton.",7,11,116
Angela," I don’t know if you guys have had a chance to use the new parking meters that accept credit cards, but Robert was instrumental in that legislation.",7,11,116
Angela, You are. You make your own drink. [Ryan groans],7,11,116
Angela," And you know those annoying geese at the park? Well, he’s helping eradicate them as well. I mean, I think they’ve really become a pest.",7,11,116
Angela, Please. It was easy once I decided I wanted the dog to piss on Gabe.   ,7,14,119
Angela," I don’t know if anyone else feels this way and don’t get me wrong, I love Michael and Holly, and maybe I’m being overly sensitive, but… the PDA. ",7,15,120
Angela, No one is more thrilled for them than I am…,7,15,120
Angela," Yeah, that story makes you sound stupid.",7,19,124
Angela," Deangelo, I forget, did you mention you like politics? ",7,19,124
Angela," Cause I was thinking that you should meet my boyfriend, he’s a state senator. I really think the two of you would hit it off. He’s a great person to know.",7,19,124
Angela, Michael! Deangelo has a peanut allergy.,7,19,124
Angela," Oh wait, he can’t help because that title has no meaning!",7,20,125
Angela, You wanna see some pictures? I just got these.,7,21,126
Angela," Uhm, these are, okay this is us at the theater. And antiquing! Oh, rollerblading.",7,21,126
Angela, See? This is what happens. You can’t let a stray dog into the house.,7,21,126
Angela," No! I’m not cleaning up a bunch of uneaten cupcake bottoms! You know, we don’t really care about your opinion. You’re just a tie-breaker.   				",7,21,126
Angela," Of course you do, Jim.  You’re a man.  Deangelo is a huge sexist.",7,22,127
Angela," Okay.  Then how about I’m the head of the Accounting Department, but he only ever talks to Kevin?  What about Pam and Kelly?  Also department heads.  But has he ever met with you or even asked you to do anything?",7,22,127
Angela," Oh, everybody. Oscar found a reason to look on WebMD. ",7,23,128
Angela, Pet Day! I want Pet Day back – no dogs.,7,23,128
Angela," [giving Kevin numbers for the copier] Four, one, seven, one…",7,23,128
Angela," Three, zero, zero. Again, zero. Four, six… ",7,23,128
Angela,"  [on phone] Okay. [hangs up, smiling] How odd, a very unusual phone call from the Senator’s office. The Senator wants me to have lunch with him at The Botanical Gardens.",7,24,129
Angela,  [limo driver lets Angela out of the limo at the office parking lot] Thank you.  				,7,24,129
Angela,"  It’s a little flashy. I mean, what am I? Naomi Judd?",7,24,129
Angela,"  Okay. He took me to the replica of Monet’s Japanese bridge, and then he put this flower behind my ear, which normally, I would hate, ’cause it’s so civil rightsy. Then he got down on one knee, and he said, will you be a Senator’s wife?",7,24,129
Angela,"  Yes, Pam. Not everyone is as informal as you and Jim. [imitating Jim’s voice] Oh, hey Pam, dude, whatever, wanna marry me? [Erin, Kelly, and Meredith laugh]",7,24,129
Angela,"  Then I saw flashes. Reporters were there. They always find us. And everyone was crying, even his aide. [camera pans and shows Oscar in disbelief]  				",7,24,129
Angela,"  [loudly] Stanley, I won’t be able to invite everyone to the wedding, because we want to keep it to 350.",7,24,129
Angela,"  I mean, we just have to see how many Senators and members of Congress want to attend, before we can open it up to regular people. Pam, you know how you and Jim did your ironic wedding? [Pam looks confused] Do you still have the plans for the dream wedding that you couldn’t afford?",7,24,129
Angela,  Niagara Falls? Pregnant? That was your dream? Pork medallions? ,7,24,129
Angela,"  Well, let me be clear. I only speak for myself, and not myself and the Senator. I think we have some wonderful candidates, and there’s a great, lively debate here, but let’s think about-",7,24,129
Ryan, Ryan Howard from the temp agency. Daniqua sent me down to start today.,1,1,1
Ryan, I heard they might be closing this branch down. That’s just the rumor going around. This is my first day. I don’t really know.  					,1,1,1
Ryan, I downloaded it on her computer. I hope she doesn’t mind. She just had a lot of extra space.,1,2,2
Ryan, Did you get the kind with the cookies? Instead of the…,1,3,3
Ryan," Can we just do one? That’s cool, that’s fine.",1,5,5
Ryan," [Dwight steals the ball from Ryan] Same team, Dwight.",1,5,5
Ryan, I’m installing File Share on all the computers. ,1,6,6
Ryan, Do you want this? [holding a full bottle of water],1,6,6
Ryan, What about this bottle of power drink? ,1,6,6
Ryan, Wow. How many filet-o-fishes did you eat?  ,1,6,6
Ryan, What am I going to do with the award? Nothing. I-I don’t know what I’m going to do. That’s the least of my…concerns right now.  					,2,1,8
Ryan," I got your sausage, egg and cheese biscuit.",2,3,10
Ryan," What was the thing, ah, you needed me to come in early for?",2,3,10
Ryan, I’m just going to take a nap in my car until work starts. ,2,3,10
Ryan," I figured I could throw it away now, or I could keep it for a couple of months and then throw it away. I mean, it was really nice of Pam to make them, but what am I going to do with a gold medal made of paper clips and an old yogurt lid?  					",2,3,10
Ryan, The temp agency wants to know what you think. ,2,4,11
Ryan," Uh, no, actually, uh, what I want is to own my own company. ",2,4,11
Ryan," I don’t want to be like “a guy” here. You know? Like, Stanley is the “crossword puzzle guy”. And Angela has cats. I don’t want to have a thing… here. You know, I don’t want to be the “something guy”.   				",2,4,11
Ryan, That’s a test prep for business school. ,2,4,11
Ryan," I just got in. I applied, I go at night. ",2,4,11
Ryan," All right, um… Why have people been rethinking the Microsoft model in the past few years? ",2,4,11
Ryan, Is it cheaper to sign a new customer? Or to keep an existing customer? ,2,4,11
Ryan, It is ten times more expensive to sign a new customer. ,2,4,11
Ryan, It’s a way of looking at consumers as subsets of a larger client base. ,2,4,11
Ryan," [answers phone] Hey, no, I can talk, I can talk, I can talk…  this is great timing. ",2,4,11
Ryan, You got to… you got to give it to me again. ,2,4,11
Ryan, I can’t believe I started the fire.  				,2,4,11
Ryan," Oh, your dress is stuck in the back. Kind of just… ",2,5,12
Ryan, Did you ask me here for any specific reason?,2,6,13
Ryan, Why is that secret? [Pam knocks and walks into Michael’s office],2,6,13
Ryan, What’s her address? [Ryan’s cell phone rings],2,6,13
Ryan, Who is your emergency contact? [Ryan’s phone rings],2,6,13
Ryan, [looks to see who is calling but doesn’t pick up],2,6,13
Ryan," Uh, hanging out with some friends, probably. ",2,6,13
Ryan," Yeah, alright, I’ll um, see you Monday. ",2,6,13
Ryan," Agent Michael Scarn, you lost some weight.",2,7,14
Ryan," Hahaha, Agent Michael Scarn, you so funny.  Word.  ",2,7,14
Ryan, Angela drafted me into the party planning committee. Her memo said that we need to prepare for every possible disaster. Which to me seems excessive.  				,2,10,17
Ryan, Wasn’t there a $20 limit on the gift? This is 400 bucks.,2,10,17
Ryan, And I have to give it to her? I don’t have a choice?,2,10,17
Ryan, We’re running low on cups. Do you want me to just run out and get some?,2,10,17
Ryan, [looking at Xeroxed butt pictures] Whose butt is that?,2,10,17
Ryan, I have a test for business school tomorrow night. Is it okay if I skip the cruise and study for that?,2,11,18
Ryan, Yes. I ordered three full rotisserie chickens worth of all dark meat.,2,12,19
Ryan, They were out of yams.  I got you creamed spinach.  ,2,12,19
Ryan," You know, around age twelve, I just started goin’ for it.",2,12,19
Ryan, I found the pudding cups you wanted in a gas station in Carbondale!,2,12,19
Ryan," No, the gas station in Carbondale did not have fresh yams!",2,12,19
Ryan, I ground up four extra-strength aspirin and put them in Michael’s pudding.  I do the same thing with my dog to get him to take his heartworm medicine.  				,2,12,19
Ryan, If I had to I could clean out my desk in five seconds and nobody would ever know I had ever been here.  And I’d forget too.  				,2,13,20
Ryan, [again catching Jim looking at him] What?,2,14,21
Ryan," Jim’s been looking at me kind of a lot all week.  I would be creeped out by it, but it’s nothing compared to the way Michael looks at me.   					",2,14,21
Ryan, [barely stifling laughter] It wasn’t me.  Um… it wasn’t me. [regaining composure] It was not me.   					,2,14,21
Ryan," Hey Jim, Michael wanted me to ask you how to raise your desk chair.",2,14,21
Ryan, That’s what I told him.  Thanks. [leaves],2,14,21
Ryan, I don’t know.  Depends if you like a little junk in … [notices camera] Umm… She’s really cool.,2,14,21
Ryan, Do you know if she’s looking for a long-term thing or if she’d be cool just hangin’ out?,2,14,21
Ryan, You know what… we could get this done a lot quicker if we formed a type of assembly line.,2,15,22
Ryan, [anguished] I hooked up with her on February 13th.   				,2,16,23
Ryan, I can’t tonight. I have plans with my friends.,2,16,23
Ryan," Actually, I don’t see myself ever getting married.",2,17,24
Ryan," Jim has worked at the same place for five years. Jim eats the same ham and cheese sandwich everyday for lunch. I don’t know. If I were a betting man, I’d say he will have a fun weekend in Philadelphia.   					",2,17,24
Ryan," Kelly and I both agreed that we would just have fun, and, I’m learning that fun for Kelly is… getting married and having babies. Immediately. With me.   					",2,18,25
Ryan, Stanley yelled at me today. That was one of the most frightening experiences of my life.   					,2,18,25
Ryan," Um, I’m already getting the pizzas from Bernetti’s, so…",2,18,25
Ryan, [making peanut butter and jelly sandwich] Someone ate three feet of that thing?,2,19,26
Ryan, Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.  					,2,19,26
Ryan, I don’t think Michael’s ever done drugs. I don’t know if anyone has ever offered him any.   				,2,20,27
Ryan," Um…  let’s um, let’s keep our clothes.  					",2,21,28
Ryan, My voicemail’s really spotty… sometimes… ,2,21,28
Ryan," One beer and one Seven and Seven with eight maraschino cherries, sugar on the rim, blended if you can.",2,22,29
Ryan, All right. Three pairs of pants. Three pairs of socks. Three packs of condoms.,3,2,32
Ryan, I’m pretty sure Jan said that we’re not supposed to.,3,3,33
Ryan," [catching ball]  Thanks.  Um, a few years ago, my family was on a safari in Africa and, um, my cousin, Mufasa was um, he was trampled to death by a pack of wildebeests and, um, we all… took it really hard.  All of us kind of in the audience of what happened.",3,4,34
Ryan," Oh, it would probably take me like an hour and a half to tell that whole story. ",3,4,34
Ryan, When I was five my mom told me that my fish went to the hospital in the toilet and it never came back so we had a funeral for it.  And I remember thinking “I’m a little too old for this.”  And I was ,3,4,34
Ryan, But the other one is. I’ve heard that before. ,3,5,35
Ryan, Because he’s my son. The doctor is the boy’s mother.,3,5,35
Ryan," He stepped on a block of ice, hung himself, and the ice melted. ",3,5,35
Ryan, It’s a polar bear because you’re at the North Pole. ,3,5,35
Ryan," I have spent a year here. I have to commit or get out. Dwight’s the top salesman in the company and he’s taking me on my first sales call today. And, um, I’m excited.  ",3,5,35
Ryan," So what if they’re not talking much, then does it makes sense to kind of lead the conversation? You know, just ’till it gets to a point where they are asking questions? [car stops] So where’s the sales office?",3,5,35
Ryan, I don’t think you know what you’re saying.,3,5,35
Ryan," Hey Dwight, you’re a great salesman. Can you teach me? Sure, Ryan. I’ll make you the ole commodor.  I’ll abandon you in a beet field. Huh. That sounds great, Dwight, I’ll really appreciate that. Thank you so much for your mentorship. ",3,5,35
Ryan," Look man, I was in a frat in college. So I know what you’re doing. I get it.",3,5,35
Ryan, Outsourcing and consolidation of competition.,3,5,35
Ryan, No. Ok. All right. All right. It’s over. This is over.  OK.,3,5,35
Ryan," No, you’re a freak. I’m not doing this anymore. This is over. Goodbye.",3,5,35
Ryan," Look, that, that’s not what I wanted, ok. I just wanted to go on a sales call.",3,5,35
Ryan," Ok, I’m going to establish time frames.",3,5,35
Ryan, I’m going to put everything in terms of “real dollars”.,3,5,35
Ryan, I’m going to ask a lot of questions that all have sort of positive answers.,3,5,35
Ryan," Saying, that would be better, or we would like that. That sort of thing. ",3,5,35
Ryan," I’m going to try to be confident, but not cocky.  ",3,5,35
Ryan, I don’t get it. I don’t get what I did wrong. ,3,5,35
Ryan," Well, I was a Temp but I got promoted. So, um… the compensation is a lot more competitive. ",3,6,36
Ryan," Oh, um… or travel. And,um… and buy an Xbox.",3,6,36
Ryan, It makes perfect sense that it would happen today because I just received this in the mail. [holds up cards] A thousand business cards with this address and phone number.  				,3,7,37
Ryan," [to Kelly] I just feel like it could have been something special if we could have kept working together, but I’m gonna go someplace else and you’re gonna go someplace else. It just doesn’t make sense.  				",3,7,37
Ryan," This kinda worked out perfectly for me. I got some good experience. Uh, Michael’s gonna write me a great recommendation. And as far as me and Kelly goes, I think it’s for the best.  				",3,7,37
Ryan," I just don’t want it to be weird, you know? I mean, I took his old job and his old desk.",3,7,37
Ryan," Um… unless you really, really want it back.",3,8,38
Ryan, Yeah. Jim is a nice guy. That’s why I got the desk.  ,3,8,38
Ryan," I’m sorry. It’s just, it’s a little distracting.",3,8,38
Ryan," Michael, please. [Michael makes kissing noises]",3,9,39
Ryan," I’m not feeling so well. I’ve got a ton of work to do here. MSG allergy, peanut allergy, I just ate there last night. [Michael feels Ryan’s forehead]",3,10,40
Ryan," Doctor appointment, car trouble, plantar warts, granddad fought in World War II. Use your head, man. I keep mine in here. [Holds up blackberry.] Look alive, Halpert. Welcome back.  					",3,10,40
Ryan, I miss the days when there was only one party I didn’t want to go to.  					,3,10,40
Ryan, Looks like they forgot the power cord. ,3,10,40
Ryan, I am very flattered. I was his second choice after “Pass.”  				,3,12,42
Ryan," Hey, do you mind if I take the lead on this one and then you can critique me after? ",3,12,42
Ryan," Dwight will be missed. Not by me so much, but, he will be missed.   				",3,12,42
Ryan," Not right now, but ask me again ten years ago.",3,13,43
Ryan, He hasn’t even said a word yet.  Just giggling.,3,14,44
Ryan, Is this the same grill you grilled your foot on?,3,14,44
Ryan, You will be a guest speaker… in my Emerging Enterprises class.,3,16,46
Ryan," If you bring your boss to class, it automatically bumps you up a full letter grade. So… I’d be stupid ",3,16,46
Ryan," …Dunder-Mifflin can’t compete with the modern chains, and management is unwilling, or unable, to adapt. Their customers are dying off… ",3,16,46
Ryan," And now, without further ado, I present the regional manager of Dunder Mifflin, Scranton, Michael Scott.",3,16,46
Ryan, What we normally do here is more of a question and answer thing. ,3,16,46
Ryan," Look, I’m sorry, okay? I was just trying to do my presentation, and… of course, I was wrong to suggest that Dunder-Mifflin might ever go out of business. But you don’t have to fire me.",3,16,46
Ryan," It’s only temporary, okay? Don’t get excited.",3,16,46
Ryan, [tapping Meredith and Kelly’s hands] Not here. Not here. Not here. Not here.,3,17,47
Ryan, I can’t imagine what I would have done.,3,18,48
Ryan," Well, don’t talk to me about calling people in the middle of the night…",3,18,48
Ryan, I don’t know what you’re talking about.,3,18,48
Ryan," Kelly, you insulted the gentleman.  Please apologize.",3,19,49
Ryan," I guess I forgot. [kisses Kelly, gathers up all the money]",3,19,49
Ryan, [whispering] Yeah. [Pam and Ryan whispering],3,21,51
Ryan," Nothing – I think, uh, we all kinda thought you guys were just, like, hooking up.",3,21,51
Ryan," Uh, she might mention an email that I wrote a while back, um –",3,21,51
Ryan, I figured. It’s cool. I don’t – I wouldn’t want to be in an office relationship anyway.  				,3,21,51
Ryan," Can you just stop this right now, or I’m not gonna do this anymore. ",3,22,52
Ryan, You have to stop yelling at me or I’m not gonna do the egg race.,3,22,52
Ryan, That’s what being a good captain is about. It’s about listening to the members of your team.,3,22,52
Ryan, Last year Creed asked me how to set up a blog. Wanting to protect the world from being exposed to Creed’s brain I opened up a Word document on his computer and put an address at the top. I’ve read some of it. Even for the intranet it’s… pretty shocking.   				,3,23,53
Ryan," [on phone, smiling] I’m excited too.  Okay.  Bye.",3,23,53
Ryan, [still smiling] Nobody.  You and I are done.,3,23,53
Ryan, I don’t think you understand how jeopardy works.,4,1,55
Ryan," People keep calling me a “Wunderkind”; I don’t even know what that means. I mean, I know what it means, it means very successful for your age, so I guess it makes sense, but… it’s a weird word.  				",4,1,55
Ryan," [Ryan looks at the phone as it rings… [Pam’s voice] [You have reached the offices of Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton, currently the entire staff is out doing the Michael Scott, DM FM PMC rabies awareness Pro-Am fun run race… [Michael’s voice] for the cure… [Pam’s voice] leave a message” Ryan hangs up]  				",4,1,55
Ryan, Hold on one second. [Ryan types on Blackberry for a few seconds] Hey Pam! It’s great to see you. Is Michael in?,4,2,56
Ryan," Yep, exactly. This is a business meeting.",4,2,56
Ryan," …let me just say something. I know I used to be a temp here, but now everything is different. I’d like your respect. I am your boss now. You’re gonna have to treat me that same way you treated Jan.",4,2,56
Ryan, Enough! OK? This is inappropriate  and it stops right now. Do you understand?,4,2,56
Ryan, Dunder Mifflin Infinity represents a floor to ceiling streamlining of our business model. The center piece of the campaign is a new business-to-business website interface that will allow us to compete directly with big box chains.  				,4,2,56
Ryan, This is a massive overhaul. We’re getting younger. Sleeker. And more agile so that we adapt to the market place. All essential personnel will be issued Blackberries for company use.,4,2,56
Ryan, I’ll stick around to help you set them up afterwards. Any questions? Dwight?,4,2,56
Ryan, Any other questions? [Kelly’s hand goes up] Kelly Kapoor.,4,2,56
Ryan," As fast as possible. We want to start retraining people A.S.A.P., so we can hit the ground running with a new system.",4,2,56
Ryan," No. [shaking head] We’re throwing out the entire playbook, we’re starting from scratch, we’re implementing a brand new system.",4,2,56
Ryan," No. We’re not. Michael, I know exactly how much time and man power are wasted in this branch. This company is getting younger, faster, more efficient. You need to prepare yourself.  				",4,2,56
Ryan," Kelly, I’m your boss now, OK? You can’t keep talking to me like I’m your boyfriend.",4,2,56
Ryan," I never cared about you? Six months ago Karen Filipelli sent me an email. Asked me out. I said no, because I was committed to our relationship.",4,2,56
Ryan," I can… I can’t talk about this right now, OK? After work, we’ll go out to dinner, we’ll talk about it then, OK?  				",4,2,56
Ryan," So elephant in the room, I have your old job.",4,2,56
Ryan," Oh well, excuse me, same office, same responsibilities.",4,2,56
Ryan," Is there another meeting scheduled, I was gonna do the Blackberry tutorial in here.",4,2,56
Ryan, [notices pictures on the wall] Ohh… man.,4,2,56
Ryan," Michael, [gets up] can I talk to you a second?",4,2,56
Ryan," Well, today was a fantastic waste of time.",4,2,56
Ryan," Michael, technology helps business OK? You should not resist it, this is the way the world is moving.",4,2,56
Ryan, Ok. I look forward to hearing your ideas. [Michael retreats back to office] [to Kelly] Where do you wanna go?,4,2,56
Ryan,"  Yeah.  I created a website.  Look, at the end of the day, apples apples flying at 30,000 feet.  This is a paper company and I don’t want us to get lost in the weeds or into a beauty contest.",4,3,57
Ryan,"  Convergence.  Viral marketing.  We’re going guerrilla.  We’re takin’ it to the streets while keeping an eye on the street.  Wall Street.  I don’t want to reinvent the wheel here.  In other words, it is what it is.  Buyin’ paper just became fun.  				",4,3,57
Ryan," And now from my old hometown, Scranton Pennsylvania, my former boss, Michael Scott.",4,3,57
Ryan, Always a jokester.  How about that image?  Crystal clear.,4,3,57
Ryan," Hello Michael, this is Ryan, first off thanks for the shout out.",4,3,57
Ryan, Why is there a kid on your webcam saying that he’s being held against his… [Michael hangs up on Ryan],4,3,57
Ryan," [steps in front of camera, adjusts jacket, poses, winks]  				",4,3,57
Ryan, [on the phone] I sent you an email about the new Powerpoint.,4,4,58
Ryan, I had IT install the updated Powerpoint on the computer so you can use it for the presentation. I really want people there using Powerpoint.,4,4,58
Ryan, Hey guys! What’s happening? How’s my favorite branch doin’?  ,4,4,58
Ryan," Okay, Michael, why dont you start us off?",4,4,58
Ryan," Ladies and gentlemen, your boss, Michael Scott.",4,4,58
Ryan, Is this the first time you ever opened PowerPoint?,4,4,58
Ryan," You didn’t prepare a presentation at all, did you?",4,4,58
Ryan, You can not have another job if it affects your work here.,4,4,58
Ryan, Why is Darryl here? He works in the warehouse.,4,4,58
Ryan," It’s not a party. Darryl, back downstairs, this isn’t information you need.",4,4,58
Ryan, How long until you actually get this presentation ready?,4,4,58
Ryan," You know what I really want? Honestly Michael, is for you to know it, so you can communicate to the people here, to your clients, to whomever. ",4,4,58
Ryan, Do you really know which one is correct?,4,4,58
Ryan," Wait! This doesn’t matter. And I don’t even care. Michael, you quit the other job, or you’re fired here.   ",4,4,58
Ryan, I told you not to call about small problems.,4,5,59
Ryan," That’s good. They’re creative, you’re not. ",4,5,59
Ryan," It’s not part of your job, it’s like, maybe you can cook but it doesn’t mean you should start a restaurant.",4,5,59
Ryan," Okay, I’m not really interested in that right now. I’m delegating creativity to creative professionals. It’s a different skills set. Look, I wasn’t good at sales, right?",4,5,59
Ryan, But I’m good at managing people who do sales .,4,5,59
Ryan,"  [walks in the office] How’s my favorite branch doing? [no one talks, everyone stares at Ryan] All right [sits at reception].  				",5,1,63
Ryan,  Did you get that after you helped me move and you saw mine?,5,1,63
Ryan,  Hey Kevin… [Kevin gives Ryan a noogie] That’s really funny. ,5,1,63
Ryan,"  I’m keeping a list… of everyone who wrongs me.  So when I’m back on top, they’ll be sorry.  Kevin just made the list.  				",5,1,63
Ryan,  Jim.  I wanted to apologize… for how I treated you last year.  I lost sight of myself and now that I’ve quit the rat race I’ve realized there’s so much more to life than being the youngest VP in the company’s history.  I’ve even started volunteering.  Giving back to the community.,5,1,63
Ryan,  I don’t need a judge to tell me to keep my community clean.,5,1,63
Ryan,  [glares into the camera and writes Jim’s name on his list]  				,5,1,63
Ryan,"  I wanted to say I’m sorry… for treating you bad the past couple years.  I was in my mid twenties and I was goin’ through a lot of stuff.  I think I never fully processed 9/11.  Um, I want you to know I’ve changed.  ",5,1,63
Ryan,  We should get a drink later. Catch up.  Pick me up around eight?,5,1,63
Ryan,"  That— I, um… cool.  Well maybe I’ll see you around.",5,1,63
Ryan,"  [exhales, camera shows Kelly and Darryl making out on the reception couch, Kelly looking at Ryan]  				",5,1,63
Ryan,  [stands up] Everything.  She’s perfect.,5,1,63
Ryan," Ok, elephant in the room.  Let’s talk about it.  Do I regret what I did?  Of course I do.  Even though it was an amazing ride, and I’ll give you an example.  Anyone see Survivor season six? [Dwight raises his hand] Anyone know Joanna on that show? [Dwight nods] In New York City, I hooked up with a girl who looked exactly like that.  Indistinguishable. So…",5,2,64
Ryan,  Kendall from corporate HR is on line one and Holly is on her way in too.,5,2,64
Ryan," I got her, I got her. I can help you. You look amazing.",5,5,67
Ryan, ‘Morning. [Dwight reveals Cornell sweatshirt] Wow. Good morning Dwight.,5,5,67
Ryan," I don’t play the politics game anymore, Jim. Can I tell you something? I played it full on in New York. I played it high stakes. For keeps. Made it to the top. But look what it cost. [takes sip of coffee] Can I tell you what else I learned?",5,6,68
Ryan," Oh, yeah, Kelly gave them out as party favors. Remember? You got one.",5,6,68
Ryan, Her America’s Got Talent finale party over the summer. [Jim makes face] That’s crazy. It was packed. I thought everyone was there. You were there. I remember you being there.,5,6,68
Ryan, [walks into Kelly’s cubicle and sets a box down on the desk] Just checking out where I’m going to be pretty soon.  When Pam gets back.  Gonna be close quarters.  Gonna be a lot of tension.,5,7,69
Ryan,  This looks like where I’ll probably do my pushups every day. [gets on floor and starts doing pushups],5,7,69
Ryan, This has to happen again. Darryl can’t happen again. Look at me. Do you want me to do more push-ups?,5,7,69
Ryan, Okay. You have to break up with Darryl.  I already typed out a text message for you.  All you have to do is press “send”.,5,7,69
Ryan, Has to be done. We’ll press send together. [phone beeps],5,7,69
Ryan, I’d like to see him try. [kisses Kelly… cell phone beeps],5,7,69
Ryan, Didn’t you two date for like a long time?,5,7,69
Ryan, I— I realized that for whatever reason I… just couldn’t do better than kelly.  ,5,7,69
Ryan, [kissing Kelly against her desk] You did that for me?,5,8,70
Ryan, [kisses for a little longer]  What’s up?,5,8,70
Ryan," [as Toby picks up his photos] You should have hit him man, guy was asking for it.  Once in a lifetime, man.  				",5,8,70
Ryan," Hey, Pam?  I just wanted to let you know; I’m totally on your side with the whole microwave situation.",5,8,70
Ryan," I was just back there, to make some cup-o-soup; the thing is still a huge mess. ",5,8,70
Ryan," Yeah, it’s crazy.  But, I guess the thing is at some point, notes or no notes, someone’s gonna have to just get there and clean it up.",5,8,70
Ryan," Ah ha ha, oh no, trust me.  I would just make it worse.",5,8,70
Ryan," I— Pam, I am hopeless at that stuff I… I, uh…  				",5,8,70
Ryan, It’s not fair to you.  And it’s really not fair to me.,5,8,70
Ryan, That was your choice; don’t put that on me.  I’m just going on a little trip.,5,8,70
Ryan," It’s not that kind of trip.  I’m going to Thailand with some friends from high school, well, a high school.  And if I don’t do it now I’ll never get to go.  And I’ll always resent you for it… you don’t want me to resent you, do you?",5,8,70
Ryan," Let’s be adults about this.  Let’s have sex one more time.  And if you have any extra cash, that would be amazing.",5,8,70
Ryan,"   Okay, I once had a glass of Cognac that cost $77.  ",6,2,82
Ryan," You know, it’s a myth that women have to gain more than nine pounds in a pregnancy. Look at these actresses. Some of them lose weight. ",6,3,83
Ryan, Heard you guys are looking for cash for the wedding?,6,3,83
Ryan," Question for you. Would you guys rather have $100 now, or $5,000 a year from now?",6,3,83
Ryan," Because you just give me $50 to cover the broker fee, I put in a hundred of my own money as the gift… ",6,3,83
Ryan, [to a girl sitting next to him] I was the youngest VP in the company history.,6,4,84
Ryan,  Where were you guys?  Do you know how long I’ve been waiting here? ,6,4,84
Ryan," Well first of all, there is no such thing as ‘The Mafia.’ ",6,5,85
Ryan, What you have are specific families. What’s the guy’s last name?,6,5,85
Ryan,"  Whoa, that’s my mother you’re talking about… ",6,6,86
Ryan,  [Ryan and Kelly talking] …it should go with the persona you already have.  ,6,6,86
Ryan,  Deal. [pays Ryan and takes the mallard back],6,6,86
Ryan,"  This reminds me, you owe me three bucks for gas.    				",6,6,86
Ryan, That’s really not the trend in vampires right now.,6,7,87
Ryan,  I’ve always found beauty in uncommon places.  Homeless people.  Graffiti.  Photography lets me capture all that.  Have you ever been photographed before?,6,8,88
Ryan,  Well here’s what I’ve been doing around here.   It’s for a series on exposure in the workplace.,6,8,88
Ryan,  I’m getting concerned that you don’t seem to understand what’s going to happen.  Do you?,6,8,88
Ryan,  You don’t have to keep saying “I do declare”.  Any time you say something it means you are declaring.,6,9,89
Ryan," Uh, it doesn’t seem like there’s much of a point if the company’s going under.",6,10,90
Ryan," The company’s probably going under, though.",6,10,90
Ryan, So should we wait to find out before we start doing all this stuff?,6,10,90
Ryan, Do you love her or do you love the idea of her?,6,10,90
Ryan," [playing Tetris on his computer] Here’s the thing. Um, I’ve tried it like five different ways in my head and – Oh, got one. Um, I’m such a perfectionist… ",6,10,90
Ryan, That I’d kinda rather not do it all then do a crappy version.,6,10,90
Ryan, Sounds like you have a really specific vision for it. Do you wanna maybe just take a whack at it?,6,10,90
Ryan," Well, I’m glad you’re finally being proactive, Jim. ",6,10,90
Ryan," I will, uh, I will do my work right now. I will stay late tonight.",6,10,90
Ryan, [from behind the door] Is there internet?  				,6,10,90
Ryan," Um, okay, so, um, listen.  I know about your diabolical plan.",6,11,91
Ryan, I found a copy of it in the copier tray.,6,11,91

Ryan," Michael, do you think I could get a space heater – ",6,13,93
Ryan," [walking up] Um, I was at another dumpster!",6,15,95
Ryan," No, uh, the movie. Did you see the movie Saw?",6,15,95
Ryan," Okay, the reason these movies are so popular, is the element of psychological torment.",6,15,95
Ryan, Could we lure him into an old warehouse or something?,6,15,95
Ryan," We do what they did in Saw! … I mean, we don’t kill him, obviously. I have a mask…",6,15,95
Ryan, Well suggest something else then! Don’t just…,6,15,95
Ryan," Well, I think he can be corrupted. Like Gollum.",6,15,95
Ryan," Nick. We could make things very, very difficult for you.",6,15,95
Ryan," Threatening you? No. [tries to crush an aluminum can, Dwight  crushes an apple]  				",6,15,95
Ryan," Jim dug his own grave, but maybe we provided the shovel.",6,15,95

Ryan, Tell her everyone in home room thinks she’s fat.,6,21,101

Ryan,  I don’t know why you were in that part of the bookstore. ,6,23,103
Ryan,"  All right, that makes more sense. You should have said that at the beginning when you said, “I read a book about anthropology.”",6,23,103
Ryan,"  Good for you, man. Good for you.   				",6,23,103
Ryan,"  You know what? I think you’re attractive, and I wanna sleep with you. ",6,23,103

Kevin," I know what’s right, but I’m not gonna say, because you’re all jerks who didn’t come see my band last night.",4,4,58
Kevin," True, it’s best to hide our money problems from women.",4,4,58
Kevin, I kind of know what it’s like to be in commercials. My nickname in high school used to be Kool-Aid Man. [makes squinty face]  				,4,5,59
Kevin," Yeah, I work hard all day. I like knowing that there’s going to be a break. Most days I just sit and wait for the break.",4,7,61
Kevin,"  Wait, back up. Do you think that I am retarded?",5,1,63
Kevin,  [spreading peanut butter on a bagel] What?,5,1,63
Kevin,  Because you’re kind of doing Michael Clump.,5,1,63
Kevin, I got a gift for Pam and Roy.  Do I have to get another one?,5,2,64
Kevin," Oh come on!  He’s right there. [points at Ryan] He was hired.  [to Jim] Oh check it out, “Hired Guy.”",5,2,64
Kevin," I think she got it as a tip, but I don’t know why she didn’t just take cash.",5,2,64
Kevin, So we had games planned but the baby ruins all of them.,5,3,65
Kevin, OK…  Who wants to guess when the baby will be born?,5,3,65
Kevin," Yeah, well, they stole my surge protector.",5,4,66
Kevin," Oscar, I’m now going to be prone to surges.  				",5,4,66
Kevin," Fine. [throws down microphone, knocks down microphone stand]",5,4,66
Kevin, [also dressed as the Joker] Dammit Creed! I’ve been up since four!  				,5,5,67
Kevin,"  You did it, man. [fist bumps Jim] Day one. Congrats.",5,7,69
Kevin," So Jim, you’re gonna live in the same house that you used to pee the bed in?",5,8,70
Kevin," Michael, I got you a hot chocolate. I hope that’s okay.",5,9,71
Kevin," Well, Meredith, there was that one time you bought movie tickets and then you got too drunk to go, so you gave them to me.  And that was really cool.",5,10,72
Kevin," Yeah, you said affected by it.   Thanks again, Meredith. ",5,10,72
Kevin," Oh, I’m sorry. I didn’t realize I was doing something wrong. If I had, I would’ve admitted it, and stopped right away.",5,11,73
Kevin," Because I wouldn’t want an innocent person, who doesn’t know anything about the form… [Angela puts headphones on; Kevin looks at Oscar] What?",5,11,73
Kevin," How about, “I’m sorry I did such a whorish job filling out this form?”",5,11,73
Kevin," [most of office huddles around print out of Hillary Swank, judging her hotness] Not at all.",5,12,74
Kevin," Huge difference. A painting can be beautiful, but I don’t want to bang a painting.",5,12,74
Kevin," Are you serious? Jim, just show us a picture.",5,12,74
Kevin," He’s making all these fancy, uh, it’s a gut thing.",5,12,74
Kevin," [Kevin sits down, gets right back up and heads back to “not hot” team] No, it’s is she hot, not would you do her. Respect the game.",5,12,74
Kevin," Ladies and gentlemen, even though the penis was fake, I was expecting a second plot twist where we found out Hilary Swank was a boy.",5,12,74
Kevin, [giving chest compressions to the practice dummy] I can’t keep doing this forever.,5,13,75
Kevin," Michael, I think you’re what’s stressing everybody out.  				",5,13,75
Kevin, [giggling] Oh my GOD… Oh man… Ohhhhh my God…  				,5,13,75
Kevin," [in the lunch room, with a sock puppet] He is so dumb that he tries to put his M&Ms in alphabetical order. [giggles]",5,13,75
Kevin, I didn’t eat lunch. [Oscar gives Kevin a look] I didn’t eat all my lunch.  ,5,15,77
Kevin," Why would we- [cats meowing from Angela’s computer, sounds like crying]",5,15,77
Kevin, Is that what I think it is? [Kevin and Oscar get up and go to Angela’s computer],5,15,77
Kevin, That one ugly cat is humping Princess Lady!,5,15,77
Kevin, I was looking at pictures of food on my computer.,5,15,77
Kevin," No, watching TV at work is really cool.",5,15,77
Kevin," A week later a friend of mine calls me up, and he says “I just saw him in a gay bar in Kansas City.” [everybody groans except for Michael who looks pleasantly surprised]",5,16,78
Kevin," My worst breakup was with Stacy.  It was a Sunday morning, we were reading the paper, and I said “Oh my God, I think the Eagles could clinch the NFC East!” and she said that we’re done.",5,16,78
Kevin, At the Circle Drive-In they show old movies.  It’s really cool.,5,16,78
Kevin," I used to go there with my fiance [Lynn is taken aback]. Before she left me [Lynn shows pity].   No, I mean, before I left her [Lynn looks confused].  She left me.   [Kevin walks away dejected]   				",5,16,78
Kevin, I think I blew it.  It all happened so fast.   So… fast.  				,5,16,78
Kevin," Hey, I’m sorry we did not have a chance to talk more.  I get very nervous talking to pretty girls.  Seriously, feel how sweaty my hand is. ",5,16,78
Kevin, Why is it so bad for me to call and ask her to lunch today? ,5,17,79
Kevin, But I do like her just the way she is. ,5,17,79
Kevin," Andy, Pam, and Jim are all telling me how to deal with this girl that I like, Lynn. I, I don’t like getting advice from more than one person at a time. I’m a textbook over-thinker.   ",5,17,79
Kevin," Lynn, I’m just gonna say to you everything that I am thinking. ",5,17,79
Kevin, I think you have the best smile. I’d like to take you out to dinner and a movie. ,5,17,79
Kevin, Nice. [Both laugh] Boobs. [Lynn blushes]  ,5,17,79
Kevin," I might have extra, it just depends on how many I eat.",6,1,81
Kevin, Do you like it as much as you like mens’ butts?,6,1,81
Kevin," I need to do mine first. Who’s been saying that there’s another person inside of me, working me with controls?",6,1,81
Kevin," I knew it! Her breasts were a tiny bit bigger. At first I thought “Oh, she has a new bra with padding.” But then I thought “Pam doesn’t need padding.” It just didn’t add up, Jim.",6,1,81
Kevin," Hey, Pam, I heard that you were registered, but I didn’t hear where. ",6,3,83
Kevin, Like money? Like you– you want my money?,6,3,83
Kevin," Cool. In the memo line, I’m gonna write, “To love’s eternal glory.”",6,3,83
Kevin, Jim is only giving raises to the salesmen. ,6,3,83
Kevin," Yeah, I don’t understand how they can even consider giving money to some people and not the rest of us. ",6,3,83
Kevin," So… you’re going to provide them, then?",6,4,84
Kevin," People don’t think of me as one of the sharper dressers in the office… but I’m going ot turn that around at this wedding. I thought, how could I take it to the next level? The hair. [Angela beeps her car horn.] It’s the hair– [beeps again.] Ok. Ok. I’m going. [long beep] God.  				",6,4,84
Kevin, She probably switched cards with someone. Like I did with Erin.,6,4,84
Kevin, That sounds epic. Can we bring anything?,6,4,84
Kevin," Yeah. But that’s easy enough for you to say, Oscar. You have that thick, beautiful, Chicano hair. So nice.  				",6,4,84
Kevin, It’s gonna be fine. It’s gonna be fine. Pam’s here. [knocks on Pam’s door] Pam? [knocks again],6,4,84
Kevin,"  I left a pair of dress shoes in a bag outside my door last night to be cleaned at polished, but they haven’t been returned yet.",6,4,84
Kevin,  I’m trying to decide if I have time to pee.  ,6,4,84
Kevin,"  The peeing is fast, Oscar.  It’s getting my tie back on.    				",6,4,84
Kevin,"  Oh, oh, does it have slots for hot dogs?",6,4,84
Kevin,"  What an awesome party.  The best wedding I’ve ever been too.  I got six numbers.  One more would have been a complete telephone number.  This was epic.  My Kleenex shoes were a huge conversation piece, but man my dogs are barking.  [sticks his feet into the hotel ice machine]  Whoo.  My feet were so sweaty I can’t even feel the cold.  What a lovely hotel.    				",6,4,84
Kevin, Jim’s gone on his honeymoon. So I started borrowing his office to fart in. Then one day I came in and I just stayed. Cause this place is awesome. It feels like home now. Even better than my home. My home sucks.  				,6,5,85
Kevin," Um, yes. [looks at Jim’s pay stub] Um, 383 Linden Ave., Scranton PA",6,5,85
Kevin," No. That…  I, I think that we should let the criminal use the card a little longer.",6,5,85
Kevin," I usually can think quick on my feet, but they were so fast on the phone.",6,5,85
Kevin, Oh God. I wouldn’t last in jail Oscar. I’m not like you.,6,5,85
Kevin, Oh you don’t know about jail?  Oh you would love jail.,6,5,85
Kevin," Okay, that sounds good. Um, I’ll let you go, just -tell Jim, that I said hi.",6,5,85
Kevin, They have no idea what happened.   				,6,5,85
Kevin,  [Ryan is walking out of the office ahead of him] Oh… where’d you get that hat?  ,6,6,86
Kevin, That is hilarious. [extends hand for a fist bump],6,7,87
Kevin, I don’t want people making fun of my weight.,6,7,87
Kevin, [watching Angela eat something] Enjoying your nut?,6,7,87
Kevin, I’m not mocking. I was just making an observation about a nut.,6,7,87
Kevin, No! Use QuickTime. Trust me. I’ve done this.,6,7,87
Kevin, Here they come. [everyone reacts to seeing Michael fall in] Boom!,6,7,87
Kevin,  Why can’t you just agree with me sometimes?   				,6,8,88
Kevin,  No way.  Last time you pulled my pants down and then you tried to choke me with my shoelace.,6,9,89
Kevin,"  [retching sounds coming from the men’s bathroom, Kevin walks to the door and goes in] Michael, are you OK?  Did you throw up in there?",6,9,89
Kevin," He lives on Sesame Street, dumbass.  				",6,9,89
Kevin,  [in character] Do you want to go out on a date with me?  We can make out by the horses.,6,9,89
Kevin,"  Now, Jim telling us all to work?  I think that is a very good sign.",6,9,89
Kevin," [at window in conference room] Check it out, guys. There’s a limo down here. [everyone heads to the conference room] Michael, look. Oh, man.",6,10,90
Kevin, I… I… I did not… That was not… How come not?,6,11,91
Kevin," Look who it is! [shows camera the cake, which has a picture of Jim]",6,11,91
Kevin," Michael it’s me, Kevin. Phyllis says I’m too big for her lap.",6,12,92
Kevin, That’s really comfortable. [Michael gasps],6,12,92
Kevin, I don’t know. I didn’t know you were gonna ask me that.,6,12,92
Kevin, I didn’t know. Nobody’s ever let me sit on their lap before.,6,12,92
Kevin, Can you give me some choices? Cause I really don’t want to mess up on this list.,6,12,92
Kevin, What about if I tell you the things I don’t want?,6,12,92
Kevin, I didn’t even get to tell you what I wanted!,6,12,92
Kevin, Michael I had you. I just want to try Phyllis.,6,12,92
Kevin," [singing] Christmas tree, oh Christmas tree, thy leaves are so unchanging…  ",6,12,92
Kevin, Just ’cause you have liquid that doesn’t make it a toast. ,6,14,94
Kevin,"  I cooked my way through Julia Childs’ cookbook, and now, I’m halfway through the Twilight cookbook.  Last night, I had Edward’s corn flake chicken.",6,16,96
Kevin,"  Pregnant Pam and I, we get hungry at the same times, so we’ve been eating together a lot.  Not all meals.  Just second breakfast, lunch, second lunch, and first dinner.  				",6,16,96
Kevin,  I thought that maybe we should do something special for early dinner.  One last ultra feast.,6,16,96
Kevin,"  For the love of God, Pam, do it for ultra feast!",6,16,96
Kevin,  Her shirt is touching them.  Maybe we should cut holes in her shirt.,6,16,96
Kevin,  [as he appears from behind the door]  Ta-da!,6,16,96
Kevin,"  Oh, say nothing.  You will learn to love me.",6,16,96
Kevin,"  Lynn was way hotter than Erin, Michael.",6,16,96
Kevin,"  Yeah, Michael, but you dated Holly and Jan, and they were so much hotter than you.",6,16,96
Kevin," Jo, I have an idea, for suntan lotion – soap.",6,17,97
Kevin," Just because Jo has no life, does not mean that the rest of us don’t have lives. Oscar has a life. I think Ryan has a life. This is outrageous.  				",6,17,97
Kevin," No, dear god, no, it’s in the trash can. In the kitchen. ",6,18,98
Kevin," Um, tonight is Ghost Whisperer. So, Friday. ",6,18,98
Kevin," Yeah. When we walked in here, we were all prepared to tell you to go to hell. ",6,18,98
Kevin,Waaah! [starts to make crying baby noises]  				,6,19,99
Kevin,"When a new mom hears a baby cry, her you-know-what’s fill up with you-know-what, and then her shirt gets, you know… that would be funny.  				",6,19,99
Kevin,Waaaah! [Kevin fake-cries into Pam’s chest] Waaaaah! Mommy!,6,19,99
Kevin, This isn’t funny. I don’t talk like that. [all continue laughing],6,20,100
Kevin," Yeah, haha. Tray of cookies. I’m not falling for that. ",6,20,100
Kevin," Man, Darryl, I’m sorry. [pats Darryl’s back] Happy Birthday.",6,20,100
Kevin," They’re making fun of Cookie Monster. I get that. But in a strange way, it feels like they’re making fun of me.   				",6,20,100
Kevin," [again on laptop as Cookie Monster as he shows Gabe the video] Oscar, did you eat some of my M&M’s? The level…",6,20,100
Kevin, Thank you. [computer continues] It really makes me self-conscious about my voice.,6,20,100
Kevin, [on computer as Cookie Monster] Do my hands feel sweaty to you? [Kevin grabs a tissue and wipes his mouth]  				,6,20,100
Kevin," Erin, you know, if I had been engaged to anyone before you, I would’ve told you. ",6,20,100
Kevin," So if you need anything, I’m right over there. ",6,20,100
Kevin," [imitating Gabe] Uh guys, I’m now going to apologize for the mess that we’re in because corporate told me to. I just want you to know that I laugh like a crazy person. ",6,20,100
Kevin, “Ciao” Right? “Ciao. I say Ciao because I’m fancy from Tallahassee.”,6,20,100
Kevin, I made the most brilliant retaliation video. It’s awesome.  				,6,20,100
Kevin," But Oscar is an accountant, and the Count counts numbers.",6,20,100
Kevin, But the Count is purple and Oscar wears purple. ,6,20,100
Kevin, [looking it] Look at that. She’s totally flirting with him. ,6,21,101
Kevin, [tries it by crossing his arms] Like that? [to Andy]  				,6,21,101
Kevin," Yeah, Michael, here’s a trick. Ask her if she wants a mint. If she says “no,” then she is not interested.  				",6,21,101
Kevin," Yeah, now you know how I feel sitting next to those M&M’s all day. ",6,21,101
Kevin," Michael, how did it go? [Michael goes in his office and closes door]  				",6,21,101
Kevin,"  That is a dangerous game, friendo.  				",6,23,103
Kevin," Wait, are they searching all our computers?",6,24,104
Kevin," No, that’s cool. Sometimes… sometimes I run. I’m a runner.  				",6,24,104
Kevin," Well, I think that the real question is:",6,24,104
Kevin," Wait, soy ice cream? Did you get real ice cream?",7,1,106
Kevin," Oh, yeah. This’ll be easy. So just, like, rearrange the buttons and stuff. ",7,1,106
Kevin, Yeah. Let me take a look at the circus board. ,7,1,106
Kevin, I know how you got it. [smug expression on his face],7,4,109
Kevin, Michael come on. A cold sore is herpes.,7,4,109
Kevin, Just admit that your baby was a mistake.,7,4,109
Kevin, But my voice is unique. Like Bob Dylan.,7,5,110
Kevin," [singing and playing drums] Sun’s in her eyes, tongue full of flies. Would you like to share my paaaaaaad?",7,5,110
Kevin," Your mama mighta said that bullfrogs are dogs, but I’m here to tell you that I am a frog! Come and sit on my log, you little pollywog.",7,5,110
Kevin," [sitting at Phyllis’ desk, dressed like Phyllis; high pitched voice] Satchel!",7,6,111
Kevin," The statement that I am making, Oscar, is that I kind of look like Michael Moore.  				",7,6,111
Kevin, I don’t think that she would leave Jim for Danny.,7,6,111
Kevin, I am never gonna forget what Danny did to Pam. I forget nothing. I’m like an elephant in that way.,7,6,111
Kevin," Yeah, and everyone else is gonna be there. Stanley, Phyllis, Angela, Darryl… Creed’s a maybe.",7,6,111
Kevin," Okay, well then, uh, I mean,  maybe we could do it like… next Halloween.",7,6,111
Kevin, They’re really upset about the whole Danny situation.,7,6,111
Kevin," Yeah, but wait, don’t tell them that we said anything to you.",7,6,111
Kevin," Well, Gabe asked me if there were any really cool Lady Gaga moves that he could do for the catwalk. And so then I tol-[tries not to cry] ",7,6,111
Kevin, I told him that there was this one cool move where she powers down like a robot.,7,6,111
Kevin, Okay? But I- I am so sorry that I didn’t tell you first.,7,6,111
Kevin, [hysterical] You think that I would let this happen again?! NO WAY JOSE.,7,6,111
Kevin," I cancelled my plans to come to this thing, and they repay me with this?",7,7,112
Kevin," With what? How? Sometimes, Michael. Sometimes.  				",7,7,112
Kevin, [reaching into her purse] Give me the baby!,7,7,112
Kevin," [gasping as he looks into Angela’s purse] Look at these scones, Jim. Thousands of them. What kind of a person steals scones from a baby?",7,7,112
Kevin,  They should do that thing where they play the really good music to get him to come out.,7,8,113
Kevin, No! I bet he’s wishing he was strangling someone!,7,8,113
Kevin, Yeah! You gotta go to the boss’s party!,7,8,113
Kevin," [getting under the bed covers] I wanted to eat a pig in a blanket, in a blanket!  				",7,8,113
Kevin," Please Michael, just make the Glee happen!",7,8,113
Kevin, Commission comes out to… dunh-duh-na-dah! Zero.,7,9,114
Kevin," I entered the sale, and I hit enter, and I said, “dunh-duh-na-dah!” I’m pretty sure I timesed it right. ",7,9,114
Kevin, [runs to and inside the Hay Place maze] Awesome!  ,7,9,114
Kevin," [stuck in the maze, says to some kids running around in the maze] You guys know how to get out? [kids run away screaming]  ",7,9,114
Kevin, [still stuck in maze] Help! Hello?! Oh! Help![runs around the maze]  ,7,9,114
Kevin, An antacid that you only take once a week.,7,10,115
Kevin, Michael! An antacid pill that you take once every six weeks.,7,10,115
Kevin," Oh, I got it, you guys, how ’bout this. Michael, what if all the boys are on one side, all the girls are on the other. The boys are like, ‘why I oughta’, and the girls are like, ‘let’s go shopping!’.",7,11,116
Kevin," Angela, are you bringing you new boyfriend to the party.",7,11,116
Kevin," I would, but I don’t want to get dirty. There might be girls at the party.",7,11,116
Kevin," Wait, wait, guys, listen. Toy Story is all about toys that come to life when people aren’t looking. You don’t think… it’s not possible… that Woody did this to himself.",7,11,116
Kevin," Oh, nothing is ever your fault! Just like when you ate those maple candies that you brought for us!  				",7,11,116
Kevin," I bet you didn’t even bring us anything, did you?",7,11,116
Kevin, [Oscar unwraps a pair of Uggs] For your feet!  				,7,11,116
Kevin, [Holly takes off mittens revealing no ring on her ring finger] Congratu-ohhh.,7,12,117
Kevin," Hey! [sticking up middle finger] Right back atcha, bitch!  				",7,12,117
Kevin," Well, I said that I would eat more vegetables, and I haven’t yet. But it’s okay. I still have time, since last year, I ate none.",7,12,117
Kevin, Well not all of us are Michael Freaking Scott.,7,12,117
Kevin," I don’t know. I’m glad this is happening. Thank you, Michael.",7,12,117
Kevin," This is a new food for me, how else should I eat it?",7,12,117
Kevin, Can I get some cheese whiz? Or hollandaise?,7,12,117
Kevin," All right, I ate the fluffy part, can I be done?",7,12,117
Kevin," It was traumatizing, Michael. I wouldn’t be surprised if I never ate a vegetable again.",7,12,117
Kevin," Okay, Michael, no offense, but you need to get your own life. ",7,12,117
Kevin," Hey, Ryan. [taps board, makes farting noise]",7,12,117
Kevin," Andy, I’m no Jim. The only way that I’m Jim is in the movie version when Jim sees what his future would be like if he never met Pam. ",7,13,118
Kevin, [running laps around the conference room] Yes!   ,7,13,118
Kevin, There are some people who have charm and some people who don’t. Guess which type I am. Charm type.   ,7,13,118
Kevin, [out of breath] Dream… big. Right? So what I want you to do is dream the biggest that you c… an. [coughing] And then double it! [coughing].,7,13,118
Kevin," No. I’m fine. Okay, from here now. The first lesson that I’m gonna teach you, right, is about finding success. And the key to finding success is to picture a winner. [coughing] [vomiting]. Okay, so then, what are you picturing right now, right this second? ‘Cause the universe is yours, people. Get out of the way! [runs out of room]  ",7,13,118
Kevin," Ok, it’s two giant dogs with two giant palm trees on a regular size island. ",7,14,119
Kevin," I don’t know, guys. I, for one, enjoy watching them, because…",7,15,120
Kevin, Can I finish? Can I finish? Is that okay? I was saying…I enjoy watching them because it makes me horny. ,7,15,120
Kevin," [through the window at Michael] Hey, buck up, buddy! ",7,15,120
Kevin, Which one? I have a lot of stupid faces. ,7,15,120
Kevin," Pizza, soda, the moon, someone to share it with.   				",7,15,120
Kevin, [as a hostage] Don’t you guys get it? Nobody’s coming for us.,7,16,121
Kevin, It’s like one of the best movies I’ve ever seen in my life.,7,16,121
Kevin, I’ve got some cheese you might like too. In between my toes. [all laugh],7,17,122
Kevin, What don’t you understand about the word approved? It seems some of you don’t know what the word approved means.  				,7,17,122
Kevin, I have very little patience for stupidity.   				,7,17,122
Kevin," Hey, your life is so insane! You should write a book!",7,17,122
Kevin," [Todd leaves. Kevin laughs uncertainly] He’s right. I mean, I could lose some weight.",7,17,122
Kevin, I got a lot of numbers here to put together.,7,17,122
Kevin," That’s silly. If anything, I should be apologizing to Packer. Because we all know I can dish it, as good as I can take it.",7,17,122
Kevin," Well, like I said, I wasn’t offended, but I’ll stand here for the big show.",7,17,122
Kevin, Yea. When I was kid we missed our connecting flight and we spent the entire day on Dallas. Then we spent a week on Hawaii… I was in heaven.,7,18,123
Kevin, No you cant do that. You cant play a black mail card and call a proxy meeting in the same turn.,7,18,123
Kevin, no this card is from the wrong game this is from the game of life.,7,18,123
Kevin," Yeah I told you, you can’t shoot people.",7,18,123
Kevin, This is stupid and I want my money back. Where’s the money?,7,18,123
Kevin, Ok you know what? I am never ever playing board games with you two again.  				,7,18,123
Kevin, And that is Dallas. [shows money]  				,7,18,123
Kevin," [wearing wig] Nope! It’s not Ashton Kutcher. It’s Kevin Malone! Equally handsome, equally smart! [winks]  				",7,19,124
Kevin," Burnt! It’s lush, dummie. Hey, Deangelo, what do you think of bald people? I hate them.",7,19,124
Kevin, Nice! [rest of the office looks excited],7,20,125
Kevin, Yes! I love banter. But I hate witty banter.,7,20,125
Kevin, I brought them from home! Do you have a red?,7,20,125
Kevin, Oh really? [camera shows that Kevin has drawn a house on the tablecloth.,7,20,125
Kevin, Oh! [Michael unrolls it to reveal it is a caricature of Kevin as a pig eating pizza],7,21,126
Kevin," Michael, I’m pretty much okay with who I am now.",7,21,126
Kevin," No, it’s just… that old shredder sucks. [Michael looks tearful] Just get one that’ll shred magazines.",7,21,126
Kevin, This all sounds great to me.  [hesitates] But I could see how some people might think that they’re bad.  I don’t know what to think.,7,22,127
Kevin," Jim only says that because he’s in the inner circle.  I also say that because I am also in the inner circle.  Did you get that, Ma?  Your boy, Kevin Malone, is IN the inner circle!  [thinks] Which doesn’t exist.  				",7,22,127
Kevin," That sounds like Pam.  You know how she gets.  Deangelo, she can get really bitchy.  [begins bad imitation of Pam] Kevin…",7,22,127
Kevin," [heading into Deangelo’s office] Jim, you coming?",7,22,127
Kevin, Yeah. [Jim looks at cell phone as Dwight’s phone vibrates],7,22,127
Kevin, Yes!  Okay. [sits down in front of basket],7,22,127
Kevin, [inputting numbers into the copier and holding up the line] One…  				,7,23,128
Kevin, [looking at empty vending machine] No food now? Someone has to do something about Dwight!,7,23,128
Kevin," In case you weren’t hungry now, but you got hungry later. ",7,23,128
Kevin, Put back everything in the vending machine except the fruit.,7,23,128
Kevin, Put everything back in the vending machine except… the fruit. ,7,23,128
Kevin," [after entering the men’s room] What the [bleep] is that? [runs out of the bathroom] Oh, my…  				",7,23,128
Kevin," Go a little higher. There you go. Nope, higher. Higher. [Dwight has positioned his feet on the filing cabinet behind Kevin and is kneading his back horizontally]",7,23,128
Kevin,"  The Botanical Gardens, Scranton’s hidden gem. Don’t eat any berries you don’t recognize.  				",7,24,129
Kevin,"  Okay, but if Angela can get a gay man to marry her, maybe I could get a lesbian to marry me? Huh? Huh? That’s hot.",7,24,129
Kevin,"  [giggling, walks to Erin’s desk] Look at the puppet! Hi, puppet! Who are you?",7,24,129
Kevin,"  It’s good. It’s just that I wish the puppets would talk more about the alphabet. Not for me… but, if any kids are watching… A, B, and so forth. You know,… M-N-L-O, P… F…  				",7,24,129
Kevin,  Do you mean it? Anybody? Are you sure?,7,24,129
Kevin,  Okay… well what do ‘I’ want in a manager?… let me see. [walks slowly across the office] what do ‘I’ want?…,7,24,129
Kevin,  So now anyone gets to talk at any times?,7,24,129
Kevin,"  What do ‘I’ want?… I’m looking for someone… who… [smiles] Everyone is listening to me. [Dwight looks at the camera, annoyed]",7,24,129
Kelly," [laughing] No. No, just something that was written in the ladies’ room wall.",2,1,8
Kelly," Oh, like … the movie about the Indian girl who plays soccer?",2,5,12
Kelly," Yeah, I mean, I guess I could do that. I don’t really play soccer or anything. ",2,5,12
Kelly," Wow, that’s actually pretty cool Dwight.",2,6,13
Kelly," Wait, not Roy.  Say it’s not your fiance. [laughs]  ",2,7,14
Kelly, You said “constructive complements”; that doesn’t make any sense.  ,2,8,15
Kelly, I’m sorry guys; can we please not talk about paper?  There’s gotta be something else we can talk about.  				,2,9,16
Kelly," That’s like, the creepiest thing that I’ve ever seen.",2,10,17
Kelly," Okay, well, I guess I will take that book of short stories.",2,10,17
Kelly, Why did you tell us to bring a bathing suit?,2,11,18
Kelly," Yeah, he’s dancing on a piano with Robert Loggia.",2,12,19
Kelly, Oh my God! That is so exciting! Can I be a bridesmaid? ,2,13,20
Kelly," Listen, you don’t have to answer now. But how are you going to do your hair?",2,13,20
Kelly, You’d look like an angel. I’m seriously going to cry.,2,13,20
Kelly," Jim, why didn’t you tell me you had a crush on Pam?  				",2,13,20
Kelly," Because Toby used to sit there, but he had to move over there because of an allergy.",2,14,21
Kelly," [to Jim] I’m serious.  My closet doors will not shut.  I mean, it only takes so long to measure to make sure that clothes will hang up because aren’t all hangers like that big?  So I don’t understand why the closet engineer didn’t think of that.  So now I’m doing this new thing where I just leave piles of clothes on the floor and then I walk around the piles to get an outfit…  					",2,14,21
Kelly," [to Jim] Beyonce, pink the color, Pink the person, hot dogs, basically anything that is awesome. Snow cones…",2,14,21
Kelly," Oh my God, he is so cute!  Would you talk to him for me and see if he likes me?  ",2,14,21
Kelly," Oh, please Jim?  Please, please, Jim.  Please, please, please?  He’s so cute.  I like him ",2,14,21
Kelly," [to unseen co-worker] But it’s so weird to fall asleep.  And I just hate it.  ‘Cause I try to go to bed at, like, 9:30.    					",2,14,21
Kelly," [to Jim] Oh, long-term, definitely.  Fall in love, have babies, spend every second together… but don’t tell him that, okay?  Just tell him I’m, like, up for anything.  I mean, I’m not a slut, but who knows?   					",2,14,21
Kelly, You just asked a girl out on the phone!,2,14,21
Kelly, I’ll tell you one thing. I am not going to be one of those women schlepping her kids around in a minivan.,2,15,22
Kelly, I want an SUV… with three rows of seats.,2,15,22
Kelly, What about second base? Like if Michael said that he got to second base with you? Does that mean you like closed a deal?,2,15,22
Kelly, [in the background] …and you went to Chili’s and he got to second base with you.,2,15,22
Kelly, [in the background] He told everybody so I just want to know is that a baseball term… ,2,15,22
Kelly, You were probably feeling really depressed and sad and that’s why you did that thing with Michael.,2,15,22
Kelly, How can someone so beautiful be so sad?  				,2,15,22
Kelly," Nothing. Oh except, oh my God Jim. Last night, Ryan and I totally, finally hooked up. It was awesome.",2,16,23
Kelly," And it was so funny ’cause we were at this bar with his friends and I was sitting next to him the whole night and he wasn’t making a move, so in my head I was like “Ryan, what’s taking you so long?” And then he kissed me. And I didn’t know what to say. ",2,16,23
Kelly," So I said, “Ryan, what took you so long?” And I just said that to him, can you believe that? ",2,16,23
Kelly," Oh my God, Jim, is that embarrassing? I’m embarrassed. ",2,16,23
Kelly," Oh, thank God, because I was nervous, Jim, you will not believe.",2,16,23
Kelly," So nervous, but now — now I have a boyfriend. ",2,16,23
Kelly," I don’t know what he’s thinking, but I would just be so psyched if we just dated forever.",2,16,23
Kelly," [to Ryan] Cool. Hey, so… do you want to… do something tonight? Or…",2,16,23
Kelly," I mean, I know it’s Valentine’s Day, or whatever, but there’s totally no pressure at all, of any kind. What so ever. So… ",2,16,23
Kelly," OK, That’s cool. I completely understand.",2,16,23
Kelly," It’s frustrating, because we’d be so perfect together. ",2,16,23
Kelly," Okay, cool. Is it okay if I invite Ryan? [Jim leaves]  				",2,16,23
Kelly, This is karma because of what he did to Jennifer Aniston.,2,17,24
Kelly, Why’d you pick the V.A. for the reception?,2,17,24
Kelly," But he did a great job. June 10th is perfect. I want a June wedding.  I’ve always wanted one. Ryan, do you know when you would want to get married?",2,17,24
Kelly," Oh my God, she is so cute, I want to die. Don’t you just love kids, Angela?",2,18,25
Kelly, God I cannot wait to get pregnant and have babies!  					,2,18,25
Kelly, I think something a little fishy is going on. [points to Ryan and Melissa],2,18,25
Kelly," Yeah. I mean, I’ve been noticing them all day, I was thinking that maybe … [Stanley gets up]  					",2,18,25
Kelly," Oh, no! I was watching Grey’s Anatomy, and there was a lifeguard on it, and ",2,19,26
Kelly, I never really thought about death until Princess Diana died. That was the saddest funeral ever. That and my sister’s.  					,2,19,26
Kelly, Don’t be scared! You’re good! You’re good!,2,19,26
Kelly," And the guys are saying, chug, chug, chug, but I’m so small and all I’d eaten that day was one of those Auntie Anne pretzels from the food court so I said “Is it okay if I sip it?” and they said no, but Ryan seemed cool either way.  ",2,20,27
Kelly," So the first time we went out to dinner, it was like, whatever, fine, but I was so nervous. So this time I wanted to be special, so I bought a new dress! [Jim hunches his shoulders and grins] One of those kinds that is kinda low cut at top to show something, but not everything. [Jim shakes his head no in agreement] I mean not everything, Jim. [Jim shakes his head in agreement] I promise, I’m not that kind of… ",2,20,27
Kelly," We’re having the best conversation.  [Jim, eyes wide, shakes his head, no]",2,20,27
Kelly, I didn’t file a complaint. I was just talking.,2,21,28
Kelly," To my friend, I thought. I want that withdrawn.",2,21,28
Kelly," Kobe Bryant has a foundation, and he is ",2,22,29
Kelly,  That is so cool that you’re gay.  I totally underestimated you.  					,3,1,31
Kelly," Oh my God! Are you so excited for tonight? I am so excited. You guys are going to click, I can feel it. So what are you wearing?",3,2,32
Kelly," Well, remember, no matter how much you may want to, do not sleep with him on the first date. It gives him all the power.",3,2,32
Kelly, My neighbor Alan. They’re going on a date tonight.,3,2,32
Kelly," And they’re, like, so smart. I don’t even know what they mean half the time.  ",3,2,32
Kelly," So, Alan, Pam is obsessed with your cartoons. She reads them every day.",3,2,32
Kelly," You haven’t even tried it on yet, try it on.",3,3,33
Kelly, Fashion show!  Fashion show!  Fashion show at lunch!  ,3,3,33
Kelly, [clapping her hands in unison] Fashion show!  Fashion show!  Fashion show at lunch!  Fashion show!  Fashion show!  Fashion show at lunch!  ,3,3,33
Kelly," No, you have to keep it today, just see how you feel.  ",3,3,33
Kelly, Isn’t that like your third soda today?  ,3,3,33
Kelly," Oh, Michael, that’s such terrible news!  You must feel so sad.",3,4,34
Kelly," I mean, how many times to I have to confirm with Ryan [Michael walks away disgusted] for him to know that we have a date tonight?  				",3,4,34
Kelly, Because they acted all tough and everything…,3,5,35
Kelly," But what they were rapping about was cupcakes and the Chronicles of Narnia. God. Who invented cupcakes, right? I want to…",3,5,35
Kelly, I can’t believe that Ryan is not back yet. Where could they be?,3,5,35
Kelly," I don’t get why you won’t go. Did I do something wrong? I mean, I thought we were really close friends.",3,6,36
Kelly," Well, go with Dwight. He’s single, too. Right?",3,6,36
Kelly," Um… Diwali is awesome… and there’s food… and there’s going to be dancing… and… Oh! I got the raddest outfit. It has, um…",3,6,36
Kelly," Oh, um… I don’t know. It’s really old, I think.",3,6,36
Kelly," Like hundreds, I think. Maybe more than that.",3,6,36
Kelly," Ruka, Nipa, Tiffany. Stop acting like such little losers and just be cool. Come on, Ryan. Come on. Leave him alone. I hate you guys. ",3,6,36
Kelly, Don’t even listen to them. They’re so…  ,3,6,36
Kelly, I don’t even want to hear it. Okay. I didn’t come this Diwali to get yelled at!,3,6,36
Kelly," If I get to stay and Ryan is laid off, I will kill myself. Like Romeo and Juliet, the Claire Danes one.  				",3,7,37
Kelly," Ahhhhh! [hugs Ryan] I’m so happy we don’t have to break up now, Ryan! [kisses him] This is the best day of my whole l ife!  				",3,7,37
Kelly, Oh! Oh my god! I have so much to tell you!,3,8,38
Kelly," Yes! Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes? They had a baby and they named it Suri. And then Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie? They had a baby, too, and they named it Shiloh. And both babies are amazing!",3,8,38
Kelly," [pointing] Hey, a margarita-karaoke Christmas party, that sounds like fun.",3,10,40
Kelly, What d’ya think? [to Stanley about his drink],3,10,40
Kelly," See, I told you. You want one Meredith?",3,10,40
Kelly," [singing] Whatever we deny or embrace. For worse or for better. We belong, we belong, we belong together… Ryan… ",3,10,40
Kelly," Dunder-Mifflin customer service, this is Kelly.",3,12,42
Kelly," Oh my god, Jim. How are you ? I wanted to tell you … . [Jim hangs up]",3,12,42
Kelly, Well I don’t even think the stripper was that hot.  Do you guys think she was hot?,3,14,44
Kelly," Anyway, do you know who was totally flirting with Ben Franklin?  Pam.",3,14,44
Kelly, Could you scoot over? You’re on my dress.,3,15,45
Kelly, I know but there was an emergency.  					,3,15,45
Kelly, Are you all right? This must be so awful for you.,3,15,45
Kelly, Well… this was supposed to be your wedding.,3,15,45
Kelly," There’s no way it’s fine. I’m sorry. If I was you, I would just like freak out and get really drunk and then tell someone I was pregnant.",3,15,45
Kelly, I can’t believe you’re back together with Roy!,3,16,46
Kelly, …Oh… yeah. Definitely… I’ll be there. For sure.   				,3,16,46
Kelly, What are you doing? You’d better not hurt that little bat. ,3,16,46
Kelly," Don’t hurt that bat, Creed! It’s a living thing with feelings and a family!",3,16,46
Kelly," Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God… ",3,16,46
Kelly," I won’t, I won’t, I won’t, I won’t, I won’t, I won’t, I won’t, I won’t, I won’t, I won’t, I won’t, I won’t…   				",3,16,46
Kelly, That is the bravest thing I have ever heard.  ,3,18,48
Kelly, I can.  You would have left me to fend for myself.  Like that time we were on the Ferris Wheel and that kid dropped a milk shake on me and you just laughed.,3,18,48
Kelly," Okay, well the next time that you get scared, that you think a murderer’s in your apartment in the middle of the night…",3,18,48
Kelly," …you can just call somebody else ’cause I’m not gonna do it anymore, Ryan.  I’m not.",3,18,48
Kelly, I call you in the middle of the night to tell you that I love you!  				,3,18,48
Kelly," Yes you do, Ryan Bailey Howard.  You called me stupid.",3,18,48
Kelly, What is so stupid about wanting to name a baby Usher?  ,3,18,48
Kelly," And all of a sudden, Dwight stood up and was like “No!”",3,18,48
Kelly," You should just read the report that Toby did.  He took everyone’s stories.  [answering phone] Dunder Mifflin, customer service, this is Kelly.  Oh yeah I could totally help you with that.  Ok, let me just get the folder out.  Okay, it seems here that you ordered 12,000 reams of paper.  Oh, 12 reams…  				",3,18,48
Kelly," Excuse me, sea monster, you weigh like a thousand pounds.",3,19,49
Kelly," So then the next movie moves to the top of the queue.  So number five becomes number four, number six becomes number five, [Ryan checks his watch]number three becomes number two, etc, etc.  And let’s just say that I just sent back ",3,19,49
Kelly, This day is bananas. B-A-N-A-N-A-S.  This ,3,20,50
Kelly," Look, I know the reason that you guys became accountants is because you’re not good at interacting with people.  But guess what?  From now on, you guys are no longer losers!  So give yourselves a round of applause.  [Kelly and Kevin clap]",3,20,50
Kelly," OK, Angela.  I love your enthusiasm.  All you need to know how to do is pick up the phone and say “Customer Service, this is Kelly!”  Except don’t say “Kelly,” say your own name.  Or if you’re bored, you can just make up a name.  Like one time, I said I was Bridget Jones, [in an English accent] and I talked like this for the whole conversation!",3,20,50
Kelly, [in accent] I like ice cream!  I need a boyfriend.,3,20,50
Kelly," OK, first, I just wanna say that you are doing ",3,20,50
Kelly," OK, great.  Now tell him that it was an unfortunate error, and we’re doing everything we can do to fix it, and that you’re sorry.",3,20,50
Kelly," Awesome. Um, awful, I mean. But, uh, sometimes awesome.",3,21,51
Kelly," Michael, you know how to, um -change a wheel, right?",3,21,51
Kelly, I know I’m near the big rock. I just know it. ,3,22,52
Kelly, [takes off blindfold] I just don’t want to get hit by it…,3,22,52
Kelly, Can we just take those first two things?,3,22,52
Kelly," Are you kidding? I would have never done that. It was pathetic-ville. No offense, Pam. ",3,23,53
Kelly, What?! [Ryan smiles and glances at the camera]  				,3,23,53
Kelly, If there was a God then Ryan and I would be married by now.,4,1,55
Kelly," I dunno, like 5 kilometers from the office.",4,1,55
Kelly," [reading sign] Oh, is… Ryan coming back today?",4,2,56
Kelly, Can we speak privately about our relationship?,4,2,56
Kelly, I want you to tell me that you care about me. That is what I want.,4,2,56
Kelly," Oh big strong man, fancy new whatever. I don’t think you ever cared about me.",4,2,56
Kelly," Well, I hope you’re still committed because I’m pregnant.  				",4,2,56
Kelly," And guess what buddy, [points at Ryan] I am keeping it.",4,2,56
Kelly, Do you feel prepared to help me raise a baby?,4,2,56
Kelly," You know, some place romantic and expensive.",4,2,56
Kelly," You know what, you’re right. I’m feeling kind of nauseous anyway. So, you know skip it. [Ryan hesitates and takes her hand and they exit]  				",4,2,56
Kelly," If that’s from Ryan, does it mention if he’s seeing anybody?",4,3,57
Kelly,  Depends… how much have you eaten already today?,4,3,57
Kelly,"  But you get to put the paper in this little shopping cart and then it says, “Thanks for shopping at Dunder-Mifflin.”",4,3,57
Kelly, What do you mean you have plans tonight?,4,4,58
Kelly," Well, you have to make a choice, it’s either your daughter, or me.",4,4,58
Kelly," Okay, I see how it is. [pushes a stack of files onto the floor] Oops.",4,4,58
Kelly," [makes a W then an L with her fingers, and then runs a finger across her throat]  ",4,4,58
Kelly," Well, I just need to know where this is going.",4,4,58
Kelly," Don’t you dare walk away from me Darryl Philben, you are the most selfish person I’ve ever met in my entire—",4,4,58
Kelly,"  Darryl Philben is the most complicated man that I’ve ever met.  I mean, who says exactly what they’re thinking?  What kind of game is that?  ",4,4,58
Kelly, Ahhh!! [drops the papers she was holding]   				,4,7,61
Kelly,"  [sickly] I am on the third day of my cleanse diet. All I have to do is drink maple syrup, lemon juice, cayenne pepper and water for all three meals. Um, I just bought some bikinis online, size 2. So … gonna look amazing.  				",5,1,63
Kelly,  I was on an IV for two days at the hospital.  				,5,1,63
Kelly,  It’s just some of us are taking this really seriously.  				,5,1,63
Kelly,  I swallowed a tapeworm last night.  It’s going to grow up to three feet inside of me and then it eats all my food so that I don’t get fat.  And then after three months I take some medicine and then I pass it.  Creed sold it to me.  It’s from Mexico.  				,5,1,63
Kelly,"  Oh that is so sweet.  Um, but I’m dating Darryl, still, and we’re like crazy in love so…",5,1,63
Kelly,"  I hate dieting, I hate it so much.  I hate this worm inside of me!",5,1,63
Kelly," Why is ok for smokers to take breaks all the time?  If I want to go outside and hang out once an hour, then I’ll just take up smoking.  I’ll do it.  I don’t care.",5,2,64
Kelly, Sometimes I download pirated music onto my work computer.,5,2,64
Kelly, And this is way worse than the stroller she came with.,5,3,65
Kelly," Um, so you’re in the tub with everything?",5,3,65
Kelly," Oh, I’m Carrie Bradshaw from Sex And The City.",5,5,67
Kelly, Thank you. Will you help walk me to the fax machine?,5,5,67
Kelly," Inappropriate. Thank you. Who are you, Larry King?",5,5,67
Kelly," [enters Michael’s office] Michael, I got my bridesmaid dress.",5,6,68
Kelly," Yeah, and you said I could get it in any color I wanted, so I picked white.",5,6,68
Kelly," Call your mom, Michael. [everyone talking]",5,6,68
Kelly," So I returned my bridesmaid dress, and it was on sale, so I’m out $100.",5,6,68
Kelly," Yeah, uh, this is all of them: Jim, Dwight, Phyllis, Stanley, Andy and — oh. Oh, it’s the receipt to my bridesmaid dress. What’s that doing there? [hands stack of papers to Michael]",5,6,68
Kelly," You always say that, and I almost never know.",5,6,68
Kelly," You just can’t come into my nook and call me stupid. And maybe if you were a little bit more nice and polite, then people wouldn’t give you such bad customer reviews.",5,6,68
Kelly," Um, we’re cool. [gets up to leave] Bye.",5,6,68
Kelly, What? I — I don’t know what you’re talking about. This is the first I’m hearing about this.,5,6,68
Kelly," OK,  all right. OK, I did it. All right? I lied, whatever. Just fire me. But you know what? I did it because you guys didn’t come to my party, and you said you would try to and then you didn’t even show up, and so you’re bad friends.",5,6,68
Kelly, Is that supposed to impress me? [Ryan starts trying to do one-armed pushups]  				,5,7,69
Kelly," [talking head] No. Not going to happen.  He has hurt me too much and too often.  And I am in a healthy relationship so I’m not gonna flaunt it and I’m not gonna hurt him, but that door is closed.  				",5,7,69
Kelly, [making out with Ryan on her desk] What are we doing?  This is so wrong.,5,7,69
Kelly," I don’t know.  I mean, it’s well-written and all, I just—",5,7,69
Kelly," Oh! He says it’s cool. [laughs] He said, “It’s cool”.",5,7,69
Kelly, Mmm hmm. It’s like a fairy tale! [grabs Ryan and kisses him] Mmmm…  				,5,7,69
Kelly," They tried to keep us apart, but they couldnt. It was like destiny.",5,7,69
Kelly," Yeah, um, but one of them is for Toby. ",5,8,70
Kelly," Um, I’m just gonna hand it to him right now.",5,8,70
Kelly," Wait, what are you saying?  I broke up with Darryl so I could be with you.",5,8,70
Kelly," Wait, Michael! Let me open the door for you.",5,9,71
Kelly, I guess people have fewer choices as they get older.,5,11,73
Kelly," There’s Andy, he’s in his car. You guys, what is he doing?",5,11,73
Kelly," No, no, no no. Shes hot, okay? Because if you are saying Hillary Swank isn’t hot, then you are saying that I am not hot. Because obviously I am not as hot as Hillary Swank! [Kelly runs away in tears]  ",5,12,74
Kelly," I have made a list of people that I would make out with before I would make out with Michael Scott. A turtle, a fridge, anybody from the warehouse, a woodchipper, Kevin, a candle, and Lord Voldemort. Anyway, Happy Birthday Michael.",5,13,75
Kelly," My birthday was yesterday, and everybody forgot. I got really dressed up and  excited, and no one said a word. There wasn’t even a party. I think sometimes people are really mean to the hot, popular girl.  				",5,14,76
Kelly," Yeah, screw you, beefer, I don’t forget your birthday, I would never do that.",5,14,76
Kelly," I guess my only wish, would be that nothing so terrible would ever happen to anyone else ever again.",5,14,76
Kelly," In a way, it’s good that it happened to me, because at least I can bear it.",5,14,76
Kelly," My boyfriend dumped me, so, I stole his boat. I mean, he told me it was his boat. It was actually his father’s. And I just thought it’d be really romantic, like ‘Thelma and Louise,’ but with, like, a boat. And it was the worst year of my life. And I can’t believe that you guys are making me talk about this on my birthday!",5,15,77
Kelly," Well, there’s no flowers… or toys… or— I mean, there’s nothing on it. Where did you even find a cake like this? I mean, it doesn’t have my name on it! Do you guys know what my name is? My name is Kelly!",5,15,77
Kelly," I mean, I don’t even know what the theme is. What’s the theme?!",5,15,77
Kelly, Those aren’t… themes. There’s always a theme. [walks out],5,15,77
Kelly," You don’t hear a theme, you see it… why is there a chicklet on my cake?",5,15,77
Kelly," You know what, I have been watching TV all week. I choose nap.",5,15,77
Kelly," So, I received my first Valentine from a secret admirer.  [Kelly opens the envelope] Roses are red, violets are blue, it’s time for your dental cleaning, and maybe a check-up too.  				",5,16,78
Kelly," Well, his heart was in the right place.",5,16,78
Kelly, You met a woman when you were giving blood?  That is so romantic.,5,16,78
Kelly," Oh my God, that makes it even more romantic.  This is like a modern day Enchanted, it’s like a fairy tale.",5,16,78
Kelly," If they get married before I do, I’m going to kill myself.",6,1,81
Kelly," Are we just gonna wait here? [Pam returns, displays sonogram]",6,1,81
Kelly,"   Here’s the deal.  I really want to go but I’m not gonna go if Ryan doesn’t go, because it’s kind of a waste of time.  That came out wrong.  It would awesome if you could try to get him to go because I’d really like to be there to support Jim.    				",6,2,82
Kelly," I love rivalries– Michael or Jim, Paris or Nicole, Heidi or L.C. It’s so much fun. But I guess if I’m really thinking about it and answEring your question honestly, I’d have to go with L.C.  Heidi’s a bad friend, and her skin is terrible.   				",6,3,83
Kelly," [walks in from shopping, with bags in her hands] What’s going on?",6,3,83
Kelly, What the hell?! Why are you being such a jerk?!,6,3,83
Kelly, No! [put’s down her bags] How is that gonna repair Ryan’s car?!,6,3,83
Kelly, This is so much cooler. We feel like wer’re in a limo and you’re our driver.,6,4,84
Kelly, How was Puerto Rico? Was it so romantic?,6,6,86
Kelly, [voice cracks] I’m so happy for you…   				,6,6,86
Kelly,"  [Dwight listening in his ear piece] Ryan, I have to ask you a personal question.   Do you think that I should get a Fedora?  ",6,6,86
Kelly,"  Well, I think I’d look really hot in one.  Where’d you get your fedora?  ",6,6,86
Kelly,  I think I’m gonna get the same fedora as you.  ,6,6,86
Kelly,"  Oh, Professor Damien D. Duck, Jim gave him to me.  ",6,6,86
Kelly, Oh my God I love it. [looks at camera and shakes head],6,8,88
Kelly,  Pam.  She’s going to punch the crap out of your face after work.   ,6,8,88
Kelly," No, it’s a punch and Pam has that crazy pregnancy strength now.",6,8,88
Kelly,"  [in lunch room with several coworkers]  Guys, what if this is our last day at work?  What if we never see each other ever again?  [Andy scoffs and looks over at Erin, Erin looks sad]  				",6,9,89
Kelly, What psycho would send that as a gift? [Kelly hugs Erin]  ,6,12,92
Kelly, [opens “New Moon” poster] Jim…. Jim! [Hugs him]  ,6,12,92
Kelly, [reading her Valentine’s card from Andy] Oh my God.  				,6,15,95
Kelly," I guess Andy likes me. I never thought of him in that way. But, I guess in most romantic comedies, the guy you’re supposed to be with is the one you never thought of in that way. You might have even thought he was annoying or possibly homosexual.  				",6,15,95
Kelly," [reading Andy’s card] You brighten my day with the sound of your voice, you bring so much laughter and love, you’re everything to me, and I was so blessed when God sent you here to me.",6,15,95
Kelly," I didn’t see you. And you were there all along. [takes papers out of copy machine] Well, I warmed it up for you so, should be good to go.",6,15,95
Kelly," [entering with Erin] Um, why did I just receive a mass email from you that said that you don’t like me? Do you realize how hard that makes me like you, Andy?",6,15,95
Kelly,"  Did you know that labor can last weeks?  Then they take your insides out and they just plop them on a table, and sometimes epidurals don’t work, and you can poop yourself.  				",6,16,96
Kelly,"  Oh my God, Pam, you are a woman warrior.",6,16,96
Kelly,  I’m not single.  I have a man. [she grasps Ryan’s arm as Ryan has his hand raised to say he’s single],6,16,96
Kelly, Well why don’t you invite your friends?,6,17,97
Kelly, I want to watch the Kardashians! I don’t want to watch boring – ,6,18,98
Kelly,  It’s about a family. A real-life family.,6,18,98
Kelly," [to Oscar] You’re adorable. You need to go for it. [Jim enters the break room] I’m going to be, like, mad at you if you don’t – ",6,18,98
Kelly," I mean, if the salesmen weren’t acting like such a bunch of stuck-up losers, then this day wouldn’t be so bad – did you ever think of that?",6,18,98
Kelly, Don’t use your cute baby to make us like you.,6,18,98
Kelly,"We’re focusing, we’re focusing, we can’t talk.",6,19,99
Kelly,Stop telling me how to spend my tickets. ,6,19,99
Kelly,"[crying] Then, I spilled my drink, and they wouldn’t give me a refill.",6,19,99
Kelly," [using a Cookie Monster voice] “My name is Kevin, I’m an accountant.” See I did the voice.",6,20,100
Kelly," [on phone] This is the second time that you’ve sent me the wrong size. I mean, I know what a four feels like. I’ve been a four my whole life. You know what? You can go to Hell. All right? Thanks for nothing. ",6,21,101
Kelly," Well, they say it’s because of texting, but maybe you’re right. ",6,21,101
Kelly, Never thought of myself as an executive before. ,6,21,101
Kelly," Well, there’s a lot of pressure from my parents to settle down and marry an Indian guy.",6,21,101
Kelly, Indian guys always wear their cell phones outside their pants. It’s so dorky.,6,21,101
Kelly, [typing] Can you stop micromanaging? I know how to do this.,6,21,101
Kelly," This girl was really rude to me at the mall. So I created a fake I.M. account from a hot guy at her high school, and now I’m trying to make her anorexic.",6,21,101
Kelly, Would you ask that same question if I was white? We’re so in.,6,21,101
Kelly," When I become executive, I’m gonna make Ryan manager.",6,21,101
Kelly," I do find that offensive, actually.  				",6,21,101
Kelly," For hobbies, um, yoga, belly dancing, snake charming. Beds of nails. I like lying on them.",6,21,101
Kelly," God, I hate you so much! [gets up, leaves]",6,21,101
Kelly, [puts a bindi on Erin’s forehead] And the best part is is that I get a business stipend to buy all new clothes. So you can totally buy any of my old clothes that I’m not gonna need anymore. ,6,21,101
Kelly, Oh. Actually I was thinking about clothes that I was just gonna give to Goodwill anyway. ,6,21,101
Kelly, I’ll never forget everything that you’ve done for me. ,6,21,101
Kelly, Because I never forget anything.   				,6,21,101
Kelly," Wait, why would you go all the way to the Poconos to P.F. Chang’s when we have the Great Wall in Scranton.",6,22,102
Kelly," Wait, that’s crazy far. Are you sure she’s not cheating?",6,22,102
Kelly," Claire’s? Zales? Ricky’s? Earring, Earrings? Fancy Girl? Platinum Cat? Where?",6,22,102
Kelly, Franklin Mills? King of Prussia? Springfield? Governor’s Place? ,6,22,102
Kelly,"  Eughh, Ryan, I do not want you hanging around Michael anymore.",6,23,103
Kelly,"  Well, because I thought that it was a book about Anthropology the store. ",6,23,103
Kelly,"  ‘Cause it’s next to they baby section, okay?",6,23,103
Kelly,  I don’t really know why you’re screaming at me right now.,6,23,103
Kelly,  That’s Meredith’s cake. It’s her birthday.,6,23,103
Kelly," [opening door] Hey guys, sorry I’m late.",6,24,104
Kelly," Guys, I couldn’t help it, it is so boring where we work. I mean, it’s as interesting as a morgue. It might be less interesting than a morgue.",6,24,104
Kelly," Of course I’m the leak! I think I Tweeted it! I can’t control what I say to people, I spend the whole day talking! I mean, I video chat, I Skype, I text, I Tweet, I phone, I Woof…  				",6,24,104
Kelly," Uh, if you turn me in, I’m turning in Darryl.",6,24,104
Kelly, You make it so hard to love you sometimes.,7,1,106
Kelly," This summer, I did the minority executive training program at Yale. You guys, I’m, like, really smart now. You don’t even know. You could ask me, “Kelly, what’s the biggest company in the world?” And I’d be like, “blah blah blah, blah blah blah blah blah blah,” giving you the exact right answer.  				",7,1,106
Kelly," I would just like to say something off of what Darryl said about the level playing field. That is actually a zoning issue. So, thank you.",7,1,106
Kelly,"  You know what Dwight? You need to go back there, and you need to “Pretty Woman” their asses. ",7,2,107
Kelly,"  I talk a lot, so I’ve learned to just tune myself out.   				",7,2,107
Kelly, What time is it? [Ryan pulls up a large analog clock on his iPad]  				,7,3,108
Kelly, Can we please talk about how gross Meredith is?,7,4,109
Kelly, I guess maybe you should go marry a meth dealer with crabs.,7,4,109
Kelly," I’m on Sheryl Crow’s side in that whole thing, so I feel really weird right now.",7,5,110
Kelly," Um, if I’m out, I’m going to sue this ENTIRE COMPANY for discrimination.",7,6,111
Kelly, Could you for once just let us enjoy a party instead of making it about all your issues?  				,7,6,111
Kelly," If I have to vote for someone, I don’t want it to be someone who can beat me.  				",7,6,111
Kelly," Columbia Street in Washington Ave! When is he gonna come out? [phone rings, Kelly answers and hangs up]",7,8,113
Kelly," [reacting to Erin’s invitation] No really? Is there time to change this?! That show! Now first they say that Mr. Schu doesn’t know anything about choreography, then like three episodes later he’s this fantastic choreographer?! Pick a lane people!  				",7,8,113
Kelly," And what was with Jesse’s sudden turn on Rachel, between Dream-On and Funk. Where the heck did that come from?! Honestly that show, it’s just. It’s irresponsible.  				",7,8,113
Kelly," You know what? I’m so confused. Is this a Glee watching party? Or a Glee pausing party? ‘Cause we keep stopping it, to get a history lesson from…",7,8,113
Kelly," Okay, they did Blinded by the Light and they did it with an actual blind guy. Was it worth it Jim? [Jim leaves] ‘Cause we missed it!  				",7,8,113
Kelly," [walks in] Are you guys meeting about WUPHF? You know that that was my idea, right?  ",7,9,114
Kelly," I said to Ryan, “I try to call you, and you don’t have your phone. I try to I.M. You, and you’re not online. I wish there was a way that I could do everything all at once, and I could just be like this little dog going, ‘Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff!'”",7,9,114
Kelly, Can you move aside so that I can ask Michael?,7,10,115
Kelly, Oscar it must be killing you to know that Michael is smarter than you.,7,10,115
Kelly," Yeah, but it was a really smart thing to be right about, actually.",7,10,115
Kelly," It’s present time, you guys. [all react] Happy Holidays from your friends at Sabre.",7,11,116
Kelly," Sabre is actively looking for ways to involve me as minority executive trainee. So I suggested choosing the annual Christmas gift to the employees. And they said, “Oh, yes. Perfect. Thank you, Kelly. Finally, something for you to do.”  				",7,11,116
Kelly, I wonder if these presents would be under as much scrutiny if I were white.,7,11,116
Kelly," I said, “I wonder.” I didn’t say, “I think.”",7,11,116
Kelly," Well, you’re almost 40. Oh, do you not want kids?",7,11,116
Kelly," That is a great idea. Ultimatums are key. Basically, nobody does anything for me anymore unless I threaten to kill myself.  				",7,11,116
Kelly," Michael, this is the gift that corporate gave us that I picked out. You’re re-gifting this to me.",7,11,116
Kelly, This is a fast food receipt from April.,7,11,116
Kelly," God, how many number nines did you order?",7,11,116
Kelly," Meredith, what are you doing? I could be pregnant!",7,12,117
Kelly, My resolution was to get more attention.  				,7,12,117
Kelly," But perhaps no achievement is greater than his on-again, off-again girlfriend. ",7,13,118
Kelly," Who am I? I’m Kelly Kapoor, the business bitch.   ",7,13,118
Kelly," It is important to brand yourself, so I have a couple of things in works. “The Business Bitch”, “The Diet Bitch”, “The Shopping Bitch”, “The Etiquette Bitch.”   ",7,13,118
Kelly," I could sit here, and I could tell you the ten secrets of business, and you would have a great time, and you would learn a lot. But who better to tell you than the Yale University adjunct professor in management, Professor Scott Powell, who I have on my Blackberry. It’s ringing. ",7,13,118
Kelly," Profess Powell, you are on speakerphone. ",7,13,118
Kelly, Do you think you could tell us the ten secrets of business?,7,13,118
Kelly," Over the weekend, Ryan Bailey Howard and I got divorced. [throws ring on the ground]",7,14,119
Kelly, The last thing that we want is any kind of drama.,7,14,119
Kelly," We were having a beautiful weekend in the Poconos. We were making love, constantly. We saw the sunrise. Ryan was crying a lot. ",7,14,119
Kelly," And in the morning we walked by a chapel and we stopped, suddenly, and Ryan said…",7,14,119
Kelly," Ummm, like a week ago, we got really wasted and it just felt right. ",7,14,119
Kelly," God baby, you know, people’s reactions to this… maybe we made a mistake.  ",7,14,119
Kelly, And who is on my side? [no one raises their hand]  ,7,14,119
Kelly," Flowers, diamonds, three-course meal, violinist comes to my table to serenade me…   				",7,15,120
Kelly," Don’t do it Kevin, that’s the fake kind of apology.",7,17,122
Kelly, This is textbook. It’s so uncool. Ryan does this to me all the time. Like it’s some offense to have feelings. Don’t do it Kevin.,7,17,122
Kelly, Are you serious? A half used candle? Get out of here Dwight. You’re blocking my table with your giant body.,7,18,123
Kelly, You can take my Helen Fielding collection.,7,18,123
Kelly, [drops papers as Deangelo walks by] I’ll get that you guys. Don’t… it’s just… you know…,7,19,124
Kelly," Oh, hi! [obviously flirting body language]",7,19,124
Kelly," Well, I guess I’ll go back to my cave. It was really great meeting you.",7,19,124
Kelly, And that is what you call a meet cute.  				,7,19,124
Kelly, Yes! Please! Please go away! And stop using that weird slow voice.  				,7,21,126
Kelly, I think we should do cupcakes. I am one of the few people who looks hot eating a cupcake.,7,21,126
Kelly, Why should I pretend that you are my boss?,7,22,127
Kelly," Yeah, but you lie all the time.  You lie for no reason.  Ryan, you just like to lie.",7,22,127
Kelly," [on phone] Mom, Ryan’s taking us out to dinner tonight.  No, no, he’s not going to stand us up like he did last time.  He won’t ever stand us up again.  				",7,22,127
Kelly, That’s like my dream job.  How did you even get that job?,7,22,127
Kelly," I’m sorry, Mr. Howard, I apologize for grubbing for money.  I can’t do this.  I can’t do this.  I’m sorry.  I just can’t do it.  Deangelo, Ryan is not my boss.  Okay?  Frankly, he hasn’t had a real job here in years.",7,22,127
Kelly," No, he’s just a big fraud, Deangelo.  He’s like Rango.  He doesn’t work here, basically.  Just like the way Rango didn’t save those animals.  It was just a big misunderstanding.",7,22,127
Kelly," That’s not fair, I mean, I’ve been working here for such a long ti– [Deangelo walks away]",7,22,127
Kelly," It’s none of your business, actually. It’s very medical and personal.",7,23,128
Kelly," Dwight went on a shooting spree, and then he shot Andy in the head.",7,23,128
Kelly," Dwight, I would like tomorrow off so that I can go on my American Idol audition. ",7,23,128
Kelly, Okay. I guess I can just not go. Do you guys wanna hear my solo?,7,23,128
Kelly, [singing] Why did my temporary boss go on a shooting spree?,7,23,128
Kelly,"  Yeah, I actually know about nice rings and it is gorgeous.",7,24,129
Kelly,"  Well, I manage my department, and I’ve been doing that for several years now. And, god, I’ve learned a lot of life lessons along the way.",7,24,129
Kelly,"  Yes, Jim, but I am not easy to manage.",7,24,129
Kelly,  [getting upset] Am I not a serious candidate?,7,24,129
Kelly,"  Excuse me, Ms. Bennett, may I have a word?",7,24,129
Kelly,"  Uh,… can it be in private? [to Gabe] Don’t worry, it’s not about you. [Gabe smiles and leaves] As Minority Executive, I think it’s my responsibility to let you know that Gabe is gross. I don’t think it’s professional that he was sleeping with the receptionist, and then when Erin dumped him, so that she could be with Andy, he became a total crazy stalker psycho.",7,24,129
Kelly,"  [sighs] Very, very interesting. And you know what? I’m impressed.",7,24,129
Kelly,"  I don’t know, Jim, ’cause, makes me think about something my grandfather used to say, which is that, sometimes, the hand that jumps out of the grave and grabs you around the throat; that is the hand that you want on the wheel.",7,24,129
Kelly,"  I don’t know. Dwight seems like a great leader to me, and I look forward to the personal perks that he promised me privately. What do you think, Toby?",7,24,129
Kelly,"  That is correct. Actually, Dwight is not the manager yet.",7,24,129
Kelly,"  I’m sorry, is that all you think of me? A minority? I am so much more than that. I am a dancer, I’m a singer, I’m a fashion designer.",7,24,129
Kelly,  You are not leaving without giving me a hug. [hugs Gabe] Ughh.,7,24,129
Kelly,  I’m sorry! You were just a lot bonier than I thought you were gonna be!,7,24,129
Oscar, You guys better update your resumes just like I’m doing.  					,1,1,1
Oscar," Yeah but Michael, what if they downsize here?",1,1,1
Oscar," Two fifteenths, that fraction doesn’t make any sense.",1,2,2
Oscar," OK, Michael, um… Both my parents were born in Mexico.",1,2,2
Oscar," And, uh, they moved to the United Sates a year before I was born. So I grew up in the United States.",1,2,2
Oscar," What connotations, Michael? You meant something.",1,2,2
Oscar, He literally won’t come out of his office.,1,3,3
Oscar," I don’t know, Kevin. This is important. I don’t want… [spots Michael through the blinds] There he is.",1,3,3
Oscar," My nephew is involved with, um, a charity for cerebral palsy, and I was wondering if maybe you’d like to… you know… if…",1,4,4
Oscar," It says it right on the sheet. Look, look at the sheet. It says, “However many dollars per mile.”",1,4,4
Oscar, I just think it’s kind of cheap to un-donate money to a charity.,1,4,4
Oscar, [in video] That’s supposed to be confidential.,2,1,8
Oscar," The Dundies are kind of like a kid’s birthday party, and you go, and there’s really nothing for you to do there. But the kid’s having a really good time, so you’re, kind of there. That’s-that’s kind of what it’s like.  					",2,1,8
Oscar, Kevin and I play this paper football game when Michael’s out. ,2,3,10
Oscar, You should ask Toby to teach you Dunderball.   					,2,3,10
Oscar," [in background, on phone] But it says no late fee… .",2,4,11
Oscar," [in phone] No, I don’t hear it? Alright.",2,4,11
Oscar, This is great. [Angela shakes her head] Oh.,2,5,12
Oscar," She had done a background check on me, she had it printed out.",2,7,14
Oscar," Yeah.  And she was asking me about stuff, line by line, while we were having dinner.",2,7,14
Oscar," Mr. Scarn, perhaps you would be more comfortable in my private jet?",2,7,14
Oscar," Hey, what’s the deal, Michael?  Why are you spying on our computers?",2,9,16
Oscar, Tin Man.  Actually we just a got a memo from IT saying you’re doing e-mail surveillance.,2,9,16
Oscar," Yeah, it surprised us all.  I’ll tell you why.  Because when they—",2,9,16
Oscar," I got Creed. And to tell you the truth, I don’t know anything about Creed. I know his name’s Creed. I know he works right over there. I think he’s Irish and I .. I got him this shamrock keychain.  				",2,10,17
Oscar, [rips off the wrapping] Shower radio. Neat. ,2,10,17
Oscar," Thanks, Kelly. You know I was gonna get one of .. ",2,10,17
Oscar," Last year, Michael’s theme was “Bowl over the Competition!” So guess where we went.  				",2,11,18
Oscar, Michael is there anything you need from me? I’d like to go back to bed.,2,13,20
Oscar, I’ll just be sleep— [Michael hangs up the phone before Oscar can finish] ,2,13,20
Oscar," What happened in Michael’s office was wrong.  I understand it [chuckles], it makes sense [regains composure]  But it… it was still wrong.  					",2,14,21
Oscar," It’s just that we’re really swamped over here, Michael.  ",2,14,21
Oscar, Are you kidding?  I thought it was you.,2,14,21
Oscar," The best present would be, you do a good job in front of the new CFO. ",2,16,23
Oscar," I get here early every morning so I can set the thermostat. I like it a little cooler, around 66 degrees. I’m more productive. Maybe some people don’t like it as cold as I do, but I don’t care.  					",2,17,24
Oscar, I’ve got a time share in Key West that might be available. ,2,17,24
Oscar, This sounds like a get rich quick scheme.,2,19,26
Oscar," So Pam told me that you do a great Stanley impression, I’d love to hear it. ",2,20,27
Oscar, You were the one joking around calling Dwight a narc.,2,20,27
Oscar," It’s like child abuse. I say, if Jesus saw that, he’d freak out! He’d freak out, Toby! I mean on some levels… it’s… and I’m supposed to work there. I’m supposed… ",2,21,28
Oscar," I don’t like looking at it. It’s creepy, and in bad taste, and it’s just offensive to me. It makes me think of the horrible, frigid stage mothers who force the babies into it. It’s kitsch. It’s the opposite of art. It destroys art. It destroys souls. This is so much more offensive to me than hardcore porno. I’m talking about the… ",2,21,28
Oscar, It’d be nice to do something for people who are actually suffering.,2,22,29
Oscar," That sounds like a great, wonderful idea, let’s do that.  					",3,1,31
Oscar," No, I’m not gay.  And I don’t understand why anyone would think, that I’m gay… if… [sighs] Uh… yeah I’m gay.  					",3,1,31
Oscar,"  Yes I’m super cool.  I am an accountant at a failing paper supply company, Scranton.  Much like, um, sir Ian McClellan.  					",3,1,31
Oscar,"  Yes I’m gay.  And I didn’t plan on sharing that part of my life with you today, so, whatever.  Can I sit down now?  					",3,1,31
Oscar,  I think the problem with this office is that ,3,1,31
Oscar,"  I don’t think I can work here any longer.  This has been the worst, most backwards day of my life.",3,1,31
Oscar," No, NO!  I don’t want to touch you, ever consider that?  You’re ignorant, and insulting, and small!",3,1,31
Oscar,"  Michael… I’m sorry.  That was a good idea.  Come on, come on. [Oscar and Michael hug]",3,1,31
Oscar,"  I was going to quit.  But Jan offered me a three month paid vacation and a company car.  All I had to do was sign something saying I won’t sue.  Gill and I are going to Europe.  Kids, sometimes it pays to be gay.  					",3,1,31
Oscar, [Dwight is running the gay-dar over Oscar’s body]  What are you doing?!,3,1,31
Oscar, Too soon. [both turn back around and walk out],3,10,40
Oscar," OK, OK, OK, all right, all right. I’ll join. I’d love to. That’s — thank you.",3,13,43
Oscar, I really have no preference. We don’t even have to have a party.,3,13,43
Oscar, Why don’t you have me riding in on a donkey into the office like Pepe.,3,13,43
Oscar," Actually, yeah. I didn’t think I would, but turns out — [Angela walks away] it’s great.",3,13,43
Oscar, It reminds me a lot of the ‘Three Amigos’ with Steve Martin and Chevy Chase.  ,3,13,43
Oscar, You’re the one who said we needed more culture. ,3,16,46
Oscar," Well, those aren’t Pam’s strong points.",3,16,46
Oscar," Angela, Roy’s check.  He’s coming in later to pick it up.",3,18,48
Oscar," Well, I heard some shouting.  And I look over and Roy’s by reception and you could just tell he’s gonna punch somebody.  Jim says something.  Roy stomps over there.  All of the sudden, BAM.  Roy goes down, and Dwight’s standing there like an action hero.",3,18,48
Oscar," Really, ten?  That’s your guess?  You’re a professional accountant.",3,19,49
Oscar, I wonder how many phone calls you’re missing while you’re teaching us to answer calls.,3,20,50
Oscar," [on phone] Really, Dixon City? …Carbondale.",3,20,50
Oscar," I expect you to apologize for that, Angela.",3,20,50
Oscar," Still said it, so… [Kevin and Oscar screw up an air high five]  				",3,20,50
Oscar," Come on Phyllis, you can do it. [Phyllis’ egg falls off spoon] Ahh…",3,22,52
Oscar, If either of these guys are put in charge of the office I will transfer to Albany. Gil can come if he wants. I’m kinda looking for a way out of that relationship anyway.  I think I might try girls for a while. Angela thinks I can cross over. We’ll see.   				,3,22,52
Oscar," Hey, Pam I’ve been meaning to say something to you.  I really miss our friendship. [group laughs]",3,23,53
Oscar," I’m sorry, that just doesn’t make sense. ",3,23,53
Oscar, You’re not sure that you have the job. ,3,23,53
Oscar," Good luck, you guys! [everyone wishes them luck]",3,23,53
Oscar, Do you really think he’s qualified for that job?,3,23,53
Oscar," I don’t know, there is no evidence of intimacy. They’ve been in remarkably good moods. It could be other things.",4,1,55
Oscar," You’re doing great Michael, look at you go!",4,1,55
Oscar, Everything OK? [Creed has made his hair jet black],4,2,56
Oscar," Michael, there’s a very big difference between these two pizza places.  Both in quality of ingredients, and overall taste.  Which one did you order from?",4,3,57
Oscar," Stanley, could you look up “accomplices”?",4,3,57
Oscar," Obviously it’s a real word, but I don’t know when to use it correctly.",4,4,58
Oscar," Michael, are you having money problems?",4,4,58
Oscar," Hey, I just wanted you to know that you can’t just say the word bankruptcy and expect anything to happen.",4,4,58
Oscar," Okay, a hundred and twenty-five dollars, Amazon.",4,4,58
Oscar, Twelve hundred dollars.  What’s a Core Blaster Extreme?,4,4,58
Oscar," Okay, the green bar is what you spend every month on stuff you need, like a car and a house.",4,4,58
Oscar," The red bar is what you spend on non-essentials, like magazines, entertainment, things like that.",4,4,58
Oscar," This scary black bar is what you spend on things that no one ever, ever needs, like multiple magic sets, professional bass fishing equipment.",4,4,58
Oscar," Michael, I’m going to set you and Jan up with a debt consolidator, you meet with this guy.",4,4,58
Oscar," So due to Michael’s clever financial maneuvering, he finds himself tremendously in debt.",4,4,58
Oscar, When I was younger I always wanted to be an actor in commercials. Then I realized I had a brain.  				,4,5,59
Oscar," Besides having sex with men, I would say that the Finer Things Club is the gayest thing about me.  				",4,6,60
Oscar, Can you imagine a life where all you have to do is summer in the Italian countryside?,4,6,60
Oscar, Very brave. [Phyllis beeping microwave in the background],4,6,60
Oscar," And George, his- his youthfulness.  His, um, freedom.  [Phyllis still beeping the microwave] Evokes, um, um, feeling, um, to the, um…  What are you microwaving!?",4,6,60
Oscar," Okay, did you get it out of your system.",4,6,60
Oscar, Ahhh! [runs into door and Michael laughs]  				,4,7,61
Oscar," [picks up and reads memo] “Let’s be honest, as fun as birthdays are we could all use a break from the constant cake, so let’s celebrate birthday month in style today.” This is really cool.",4,7,61
Oscar," No, totally, totally. This way we get it all out of the way at once and it could actually be fun. ",4,7,61
Oscar,  All I had this weekend to eat was a chicken breast and a case of Diet Coke.,5,1,63
Oscar,"  OK. [holds elevator] Stanley, come on.",5,1,63
Oscar,"  Hey, if you’re into yoga, I take a great bikram class in Dickson City.",5,1,63
Oscar,  Also — and no pressure — the teacher? He’s a catch.,5,1,63
Oscar,  Because it’s your making-fun-of-fat-people character.,5,1,63
Oscar,"  I think of him as more like… a monster?  What about, “I say, I say, I say, I’ll sit on you!”",5,1,63
Oscar, That isn’t ethics.  Ethics is a real discussion of the competing conceptions of the good.  This is just the corporate anti-shoplifting rules.,5,2,64
Oscar," Ok, once in a while I’ll take a long lunch.",5,2,64
Oscar, Why do we have to pay money to get a gift for his ex-girlfriend’s unborn sperm bank baby?,5,3,65
Oscar, She’s got an Orbit; that’s a twelve hundred dollar stroller.,5,3,65
Oscar, I don’t want to talk. I want my laptop back.  				,5,4,66
Oscar," So, in order to recoup the value of items we liked, we have to spend more money on things we don’t want. Who would ever come to this?",5,4,66
Oscar,  [Creed dressed as the Joker enters] Whoa. Awesome.,5,5,67
Oscar, I made egg salad sandwiches. Do you want one? [holds up sandwich],5,7,69
Oscar, I’m probably going to leave after one drink.,5,7,69
Oscar, Nice to meet you. [shakes Marie’s hand],5,7,69
Oscar, Don’t do this. [watches Andy take drinks to the other table],5,7,69
Oscar," Its just that I’ve sat next to Angela for a very long, very long time.",5,7,69
Oscar, What do you see in her?  Wh — what do you see in Angela?,5,7,69
Oscar," Y–Are you guys waiting to get married, or?",5,7,69
Oscar," Andy, something is wrong with that woman.",5,7,69
Oscar, I’d like to know.  You should call her and ask her. I’d like to know what’s wrong with her.,5,7,69
Oscar," Do it! It’s a— Call her! [Andy holds up phone]  Oh my God, don’t call her! Don’t call her, Andy. [giggling] Andy, don’t call her! ",5,7,69
Oscar," Hey, um… thanks for trying to hook me up.",5,7,69
Oscar, I can’t believe we called her up. [both laugh],5,7,69
Oscar, I’m talking about Angela. I can’t believe we called her up last night.,5,7,69
Oscar," Good morning, Michael.  [Michael approaches table] Are you ready for the meeting?",5,7,69
Oscar, [reading from a note on the microwave] “To whoever made the microwave mess:,5,8,70
Oscar," As you can see, we did pretty well, so…",5,9,71
Oscar," Alright, well this is the overall budget for this fiscal year along the x-axis…",5,9,71
Oscar, You can see clearly on this page that we have a surplus of $4300.,5,9,71
Oscar, But we have to spend that by the end of the day or it will be deducted from next year’s budget.,5,9,71
Oscar, Your mommy and daddy give you ten dollars to open up a lemonade stand. So you go out and you buy cups and you buy lemons and you buy sugar. And now you find out that it only costs you nine dollars.,5,9,71
Oscar," So you can give that dollar back to mommy and daddy, but guess what? Next summer…",5,9,71
Oscar," And you ask them for money, they’re gonna give you nine dollars. ‘Cause that’s what they think it costs to run the stand. So what you want to do is spend that dollar on something now, so that your parents think it costs ten dollars to run the lemonade stand.",5,9,71
Oscar, We have to spend that $4300 by the end of the day or it’ll be deducted from next year’s budget.,5,9,71
Oscar," We should spend this money on a new copier, which we desperately need.",5,9,71
Oscar," Now listen, we are a paper company. How can we take pride in our jobs if we have to put our fine paper in this wretched machine?",5,9,71
Oscar, I’m just gonna grab some lunch. You wanna come with?,5,9,71
Oscar, [laughing uproariously with Michael and Jim] Stop it! Michael.,5,9,71
Oscar," The best. Great friends. Thank you, Michael. [all three are still laughing]",5,9,71
Oscar, Does anyone happen to know what 15% of 4300 is?,5,9,71
Oscar," What’s 15% of 200? [Michael doesn’t answer] Thank you. Everyone, Michael is returning the surplus so he can keep 15% as a bonus.",5,9,71
Oscar," Michael, you have to make a decision. The day is almost done.",5,9,71
Oscar, You are a smart guy. I know you’ll do the right thing.,5,9,71
Oscar, I just figured I’d rather have new chairs than nothing at all.,5,9,71
Oscar," We’re back on the 5th, should we just do it then?",5,10,72
Oscar, What is wrong with you? She is engaged.,5,11,73
Oscar," Are you serious? Ugh. Where? [Dwight stares at Oscar; more forcefully] Where? [Dwight’s expression implies ‘at your desk’; Oscar’s voice breaks] Where, Dwight?",5,11,73
Oscar," That was good… It’s just, at the end you weren’t saying something that could also apply to the form.",5,11,73
Oscar," Mm-mm. It’s 4:10, I don’t think he’s gonna show.",5,11,73
Oscar, The Prius is silent if he keeps it under five miles per hour. He deserves the win.,5,11,73
Oscar," See that, the obvious symmetry of the face? That’s a natural appeal of the scientific standard of coin aphelia, features that are a composite average of many features. Yes, she is attractive, but is not hot.   ",5,12,74
Oscar," That’s the thing about debating, you’re just going to get people more entrenched in the view they had in the first place. [two sides of the debate start arguing]  ",5,12,74
Oscar, Michael are you serious? You really want us to roast you?,5,13,75
Oscar, I consider myself a good person. But I’m gonna try to make him cry.  				,5,13,75
Oscar, Alright Kevin. Enough with the Michael jokes. I think he got it bad enough yesterday.,5,13,75
Oscar," Michael, I feel like I was a little harsh yesterday. [murmurs of agreement]",5,13,75
Oscar," [quietly] Oh, my desk is over… [quickly walks away]",5,14,76
Oscar, [Kevin is holding two ice cream treats] Two?,5,15,77
Oscar," Angela, you’re more chipper than usual.",5,15,77
Oscar," Is she cleaning the cat with her tongue? [Angela licks cat, meows]",5,15,77
Oscar," I want to get that image out of my head. The psychological issues that go behind licking a cat, are not things I want to go into. Also, I’m pretty sure she coughed up a hairball.  ",5,15,77
Oscar, Do you risk telling him how you feel?  Do you say something that you can barely admit to yourself?,5,16,78
Oscar, He told me he wasn’t gay. [everyone groans],5,16,78
Oscar," Angela, you had two sets of different men actually duel over you?",5,16,78
Oscar," He made non-refundable deposits on his honeymoons, so he’s just knocking them off one at a time.  I think today he’s hot air ballooning and later he’s got a couple’s massage.",5,16,78
Oscar, Why do you always go to that?  Has anyone ever been after anyone in this office?,5,16,78
Oscar," Michael, what do you think shutting down a branch is?",5,17,79
Oscar," I bet there’s something there. I was with them in the kitchen yesterday, and they were all too happy to be cleaning the freezer.",6,1,81
Oscar," If you resisted Brad Pitt a little bit, he would still… need to get to you?",6,1,81
Oscar, Wow. I wish… I wish I could help you. I don’t… you might be gay. You might be gay.,6,1,81
Oscar,  What exactly is my responsibility here? To comfort insecure heterosexual men? That can’t possibly fall to me.  				,6,1,81
Oscar, [to Andy] What? You think I’m the voice of the Taco Bell dog?,6,1,81
Oscar," Michael, why? Why say all these things? Why make up an eating disorder, Stanley’s affair, me being a spokesdog… ",6,1,81
Oscar,"   I’m sure everything will be fine.  [pulls up a chair]  What do you? What’s the procedure, if you don’t mind my asking?",6,2,82
Oscar,   Yeah.  [Oscar gets up and walks out]  				,6,2,82
Oscar," Look, it doesn’t take a genius to know that any organization thrives when it has two leaders. Go ahead, name a country that doesn’t have two presidents. A boat that sets sail without two captains. Where would Catholicism be without the popes?   				",6,3,83
Oscar," Thank you, Jim, for thinking that we’re smart people. ",6,3,83
Oscar," Excellent question, genius. It’s because Jim wants to give the raises to his friends and the people he sleeps with. ",6,3,83
Oscar," Hold on, Kelly. Would it help you to know that Jim thinks you’re smart?",6,3,83
Oscar, We work just as hard as the sales people. We deserve raises. ,6,3,83
Oscar," We would just like to know what’s happening. Are we getting a raise, yes or no?",6,3,83
Oscar, You thought I was dating this? What the hell is wrong with you?,6,4,84
Oscar, It’s not a good idea. There’s no such thing as a good hairpiece.,6,4,84
Oscar, [to Kevin who is bouncing up and down]  What are you doing?,6,4,84
Oscar,"  Guys, maybe we should wait a little more time before we start grabbing boxes.    				",6,4,84
Oscar," Hey guys, I drive a SUV, does that mean I’m in the mob?",6,5,85
Oscar," For the record, not all Italian-Americans are in the Mafia.",6,5,85
Oscar," Uhh. All right, who else is here? [looks around]  				",6,5,85
Oscar, Pam and Jim are on their honeymoon. So there’s not the usual balance between “sane and others.” Toby has mentally checked out since June. It’s a very dangerous time. The “coalition for reason” is extremely weak.  				,6,5,85
Oscar," It’s, it’s a completely different name!",6,5,85
Oscar," No, what are you talking about, what mobster would change his name from Gotti to Grotti. It weakens it.",6,5,85
Oscar, Jim? It’s Oscar. I’m so sorry to be calling you on your honeymoon. ,6,5,85
Oscar," It’s Michael, he thinks he’s being shaken down by the mob. I don’t know how you usually handle this. ",6,5,85
Oscar," You’re right. You’re right. [Pam hangs up] Oh, okay bye.  				",6,5,85
Oscar, Why would you cancel Jim’s credit cards?,6,5,85
Oscar," Accounting-wise, no. But phone-wise, just call up and cancel it. ",6,5,85
Oscar," Just to be clear, he backed down an insurance agent from Mutual of Harrisburg.",6,5,85
Oscar,  You have no sense of boundaries Michael.,6,6,86
Oscar,"  Pam, just for the record, I think you’re overreacting a little bit, your mom’s old enough to make her own decisions.  ",6,6,86
Oscar," Jim, I think I’m in your way. [leans back – they both exit]",6,7,87
Oscar,  It’s not a fight.  What other outcome could there be?,6,8,88
Oscar,"  I found the article. [everyone walks over to his desk, he begins reading the article]  “On a day marked by panicked corporate board meetings, one that is relatively not surprising is Dunder Mifflin’s.  It is rumored that they will recommend… ” and the article cuts off.",6,9,89
Oscar,"  Not necessarily, bankruptcy could mean a lot of things.  Maybe they’re just restructuring to get out of debt.",6,9,89
Oscar,  Or it could mean the end of Dunder Mifflin.,6,9,89
Oscar,"  It’s my blackberry Michael, I am trying to get updates on the company.",6,9,89
Oscar,"  I just got an email from corporate, specifically for Accounting to stop all payments to our vendors.",6,9,89
Oscar," Well, maybe nothing but it could mean a problem with liquidity-",6,9,89
Oscar,"  [tries to speak in a high-pitched southern accent] This plantation, we’re running low on greenbacks.  We’re having problems paying the people who give us the seeds and the dirt.  We can’t pay… [in regular voice] – Michael, I can’t – Basically it could mean a lot of things, but it is unprecedented, so it’s cause for concern.",6,9,89
Oscar, The long term problem is bad investments that they need to dump. The short term problem is the company has no cash and there’s no where to get it.,6,10,90
Oscar, This is so typical of management to spend money on this. Ugh. Bunch of boobs.,6,10,90
Oscar," The Dunder Mifflin stock symbol is DMI. Do you know what that stands for? Dummies, morons and idiots. Because that’s what you’d  have to be to own it. And, as one of those idiots, I believe the board owes me answers.  				",6,10,90
Oscar," Can you believe this? The money they spent on this convention hall. [finding a seat] Excuse me, miss. I just want to take the stupid board of directors by their necks. This is so simple. ",6,10,90
Oscar," Oh, what a great idea and lose my job. No thank you.",6,10,90
Oscar," I feel, as does Mr. Scott, that we are in the best of hands. Capable hands.",6,10,90
Oscar, I think this has gone very well and I thank you.,6,10,90
Oscar," You -[Oscar walks away, Michael goes back in the room] ",6,10,90
Oscar," I’ll just leave it here with you. [drops checks, leaves. Daryl smirks]  ",6,12,92
Oscar, Is it that obvious?  [Pam starts towards Matt] No- hey…,6,12,92
Oscar," Right, Matt. [Matt leaves] I know what I’m doing, Pam.  ",6,12,92
Oscar, I think you don’t know what you’re saying.,6,14,94
Oscar, Right? Mm. Did we try printer first? Shredder at an angle – ,6,14,94
Oscar," Fax, cable, then the scanner upside down?",6,14,94
Oscar, Sabre has no caps on commissions. He can make a lot more money in sales.,6,15,95
Oscar,  That’s fancy feast.  Ultra feast is something they made up so they can pig out together in the name of ceremony.,6,16,96
Oscar,"  The hospital provides dictionaries, bring a thesaurus!",6,16,96
Oscar," In the training manual it says, that there is a minority executive training program in Tallahassee?",6,17,97
Oscar," No! No, no no! Put your credit cards away. Drinks are on us!",6,17,97
Oscar," Way to go, guys. This was an integrity move.",6,18,98
Oscar,"Essentially, what we have here is one of those stories where a mother lifts a car to save her baby.  				",6,19,99
Oscar,"Well… Hey, uh, are you doing anything later tonight?",6,19,99
Oscar,"Yeah, we talked this morning and we talked at Christmas. So, a little momentum there. [tries to open door, locked] Just a couple of hours to kill before work.   				",6,19,99
Oscar,"You know what we haven’t done in a while? Happy hour. Upstairs, the warehouse, everybody just going out for a drink.",6,19,99
Oscar,Maybe you’re right. I should count myself lucky. ,6,19,99
Oscar, Thank you. It didn’t even take that long.,6,20,100
Oscar, Erin? I think we’re out of fax cover sheets. ,6,20,100
Oscar, Sounds like they just got to go home with pay.,6,20,100
Oscar," Michael’s having a hard time with the gender part of Spanish. So I told him to mark everything with the international symbol for gender. And, um… [holds up two blurred-out drawings of male and female genitalia] I should have been more specific.  				",6,21,101
Oscar, I don’t see how we could possibly sell these for that little without losing money. Delivery alone will cost… ,6,21,101
Oscar," Actually, ran the numbers on this, and in this case, it makes more financial sense to gain money. ",6,21,101
Oscar," Michael, he’s right. You are turning into a stalker.",6,21,101
Oscar," Dwight, we know Kelly applied. We’re not gonna cross her. No matter how good the program is.",6,21,101
Oscar," It’s not a signal. It’s just a coincidence. No, it’s not even a coincidence. It’s just something that happened. ",6,21,101
Oscar,  All that does is help you shoot around things. What does Bin Laden…,6,23,103
Oscar,  Why would you throw something wet at me?,6,23,103
Oscar," The lawyers are searching our hard drives for information on the leak. Thanks a lot, Big Brother.",6,24,104
Oscar," Michael, that’s nepotism. Luke is getting special treatment because he’s your nephew.",7,1,106
Oscar, This is hypothetical. We’re talking about Luke who happens to be terrible. ,7,1,106
Oscar," If there’s nothing wrong with this, Michael, why have you been keeping it a secret?",7,1,106
Oscar," Ah, my favorite part of an ice cream party. The bagel chips. ",7,1,106
Oscar," Oh sure, those are the expense reports that corporate was waiting for yesterday. ",7,1,106
Oscar,  Office Administrator. So when did this happen?,7,2,107
Oscar,  Maybe something not so monochromatic. Not so matching. ,7,2,107
Oscar," It was an amateur production, technically. ",7,3,108
Oscar," Andy, the reason it seems more recent is because many of us here have never stood up and asked for everyone’s attention, and it seems like you’ve done it on several occasions.",7,4,109
Oscar," I love cycling. Andy, I feel like a tourist in my own city. I literally can’t wait to wake up every morning.",7,5,110
Oscar," No, Meredith, that’s not his actual bicycle, but it is the same exact model he uses.",7,5,110
Oscar, It’s pandering. And it makes me think you think I’m stupid.,7,5,110
Oscar," It’s hard to judge ourselves accurately, isn’t it.",7,5,110
Oscar," So what kind of statement are you making with that costume, Kevin?",7,6,111
Oscar," Everyone realizes that this coupon book isn’t actually worth fifteen thousand dollars, right? You’d have to spend two hundred thousand dollars on crap you don’t actually need to get fifteen thousand dollars worth of benefits. I’m not the only one who sees this, right?",7,6,111
Oscar, That’s a great name. You’re hilarious. A plus!,7,6,111
Oscar, Guys? You’re arguing over a one in sixteen chance. Over a prize worth… forty bucks.,7,6,111
Oscar, I guess you could say I’m still in costume. I’m a rational consumer.,7,6,111
Oscar, Stupid coupon booklet. Have you seen my costume? I’m a rational consumer.,7,6,111
Oscar," I present to you the [finger quotes] rational consumer, as it were.  				",7,6,111
Oscar, [reaches over to pull Erin out of apple bobbing water] ERIN!,7,6,111
Oscar, Why do we have to do something together? I volunteer at a clinic on my own time.,7,7,112

Oscar," [noise on TV, Oscar pauses show] That one! She’s been in a couple episodes of Friday Night…",7,8,113

Oscar, This is why Erin! We’re living it! Start recording now!,7,8,113
Oscar," Did you ever think of WUPHF as an emergency notification system, like, for college campuses with shooters or gas leaks?",7,9,114
Oscar," Sure, how long can you sustain this without a cash infusion?",7,9,114
Oscar," Actually, that’s not true. I know the figure you’re referring to, and it’s a projection of fifteen years from now.",7,10,115
Oscar," Michael, China’s agrarian. Urbanizing fast? You bet ‘cha, but still agrarian.",7,10,115
Oscar, Where are you getting this information?,7,10,115
Oscar, Guys its not worth it really. Guys this is not worth our time.,7,10,115
Oscar, Great. I was wrong. I’m wrong. Is everyone happy?  				,7,10,115
Oscar," He’s… he’s not smarter than me, he was just right about one thing.",7,10,115
Oscar, I was thinking about some of the stuff you said earlier about China.,7,10,115
Oscar," Michael, the reason I asked you down here for this chat is that I’ve been thinking that your fears about China are a bit exaggerated.",7,10,115
Oscar," Actually, we’re in a mild recession right now. I’ll give you that, but people use China as the boogie man for all their problems. In the nineteen eighties, it was Japan.",7,10,115
Oscar, Do you really think that manufacturing is a relevant indicator of where the world economy’s heading in 2011? Do you know the comparative expansion of say the information sector? I’d say that’s far more relevant. Wouldn’t you?,7,10,115
Oscar," Don’t worry about the coffee, its on me.",7,10,115
Oscar," Michael, I am so happy that we were able to have this little chat.",7,10,115
Oscar, That wasn’t what we were discu… That wasn’t the whole…  				,7,10,115
Oscar, Who are you dating in the public arena?,7,11,116
Oscar," Senator, it’s an honor. I’m Angela’s friend Oscar.",7,11,116
Oscar," Robert seems great. He’s very handsome, firm handshake, he’s gay, good sense of humor.  				",7,11,116
Oscar," Oh, you mean the state senator. I’m sorry, I was confused, because you accidentally wrote ‘the senator’.",7,12,117
Oscar, It means you’re playing someone who’s going to destroy you. Why did you play “moo”?,7,13,118
Oscar," Okay, but look, you could have hit “mood”. Would have played a… ",7,13,118
Oscar, A little treat for our old friend Gabe. Put that “q” right there. ,7,13,118
Oscar, Put the “q” there! [phone rings] Sorry I yelled. ,7,13,118
Oscar," [pulls phone back] Ah. No! [laughing] [hands phone back]. Although I must say, I will have “apoplexy” if you lose. Do you understand? “Apoplexy” is what I will have. ",7,13,118

Oscar," Huh…[muffled screaming as he slowly chokes, and eventually dies]",7,16,121

Oscar," Wanna know how to do it? Here’s how you do it. Take her out to dinner. Go down on one knee. If you are in costume, you did something wrong. If at any point you find yourself tying a ring to a dogs collar, stop, and look at yourself.  				",7,18,123
Oscar," What… Ryan, where did you get this picture? [a picture of Oscar on Ryans bottles of salsa]  				",7,18,123
Oscar, Michael is leaving. And apparently they’ve already hired a new manager. And we’re meeting him today. It’s a lot to process. Paperwork wise.   				,7,19,124
Oscar," Well, Deangelo, I’d say communication could be improved. People stopped reading memos, so everyone marks them urgent.",7,19,124

Oscar, [buzzer to indicate a blocked site] Firewall. ,7,23,128
Oscar, Could you turn the volume down on the beeping? ,7,23,128
Oscar,"  Angela’s engaged to a gay man. As a gay man, I’m horrified. As a friend of Angela’s, horrified. As a lover of elegant weddings, [smiles] I’m a little excited. [expression becomes serious again] But overall, horrified.  				",7,24,129
Oscar,  My friend at the Scranton Blade is totally plugged into these matters.,7,24,129

Jan," OK. Since the last meeting, Ellen and the board have decided we can’t justify a Scranton branch and a Stamford branch.",1,1,1
Jan,"  No, no, no, Michael, listen OK. Don’t panic. We haven’t made… We haven’t decided.",1,1,1
Jan, I’ve spoken to Josh in Stamford. I’ve told him the same as you and it’s up to either him or you to convince me that your branch can incorporate the other.,1,1,1
Jan," This does, however, mean that there is going to be downsizing. ",1,1,1
Jan, So do you think we could keep a lid on this for now? I don’t want to worry people unnecessarily.,1,1,1
Jan," So, which health plan have you decided on?",1,3,3
Jan," Wait, acupuncture? None of the plans have acupuncture. Have you looked at them closely Michael?",1,3,3
Jan, The Gold Plan? I’m not even on that plan.,1,3,3
Jan," You know the whole reason that we’re doing this, is to save money. So you just need to pick a provider and choose the cheapest plan.",1,3,3
Jan," Sometimes a manager, like yourself, has to deliver the bad news to the employees. I do it all the time.",1,3,3
Jan," Dwight, listen to me very carefully. You are not a manager of anything. Understand?",1,3,3
Jan," OK, when Michael gets back, you tell him to call me immediately.",1,3,3
Jan, No. Please don’t use my cell phone ever again.,1,3,3
Jan, Alan and I have created an incentive program to increase sales. ,1,6,6
Jan, We’ve created an incentive program to increase sales. ,1,6,6
Jan, At the end of the month you can reward your top seller with a prize worth up to a thousand dollars. ,1,6,6
Jan," No, Michael. No. You can’t win this prize. ",1,6,6
Jan," [on speaker phone] It’s a, it’s, it’s a two and a half hour drive from New York, Michael.",2,1,8
Jan," No, we don’t approve of this Michael. I mean, y-you only had the budget for one office party a year, so… we’re not paying for this.",2,1,8
Jan, Really? I’m dropping an atomic bomb on you?,2,1,8
Jan, You already had a party on May 5th for no reason.,2,1,8
Jan, And a tsunami relief fundraiser which somehow lost a lot of money.,2,1,8
Jan," Okay, well, I don’t understand why anyone would have a tsunami FUN raiser, Michael. I mean, that doesn’t even make sense.",2,1,8
Jan," [to cell phone] Yes. Yes, I did. Okay. Well, we can talk about that later then. [to Pam] Hi.",2,2,9
Jan," You seem a little bit agitated, Michael. What’s the problem? ",2,2,9
Jan," Well, that… that’s true in a way. You can’t say anything. ",2,2,9
Jan," Do you need to see the video again, Michael?",2,2,9
Jan," [to Albiny] ‘Scuse me, I’m sorry. [to Michael] Michael. Mr. O’Malley is your lawyer.",2,2,9
Jan," Mr. O’Malley is our Corporate lawyer. We have him on retainer. To protect the company as well as upper level management, such as yourself.",2,2,9
Jan, This is a projection of the county’s needs… ,2,7,14
Jan," Thirteen schools, uh, two hospitals…   ",2,7,14
Jan," So when we get to the Radisson, I’d like to, um-",2,7,14
Jan, Alright.  But you will let me run this meeting.,2,7,14
Jan," Michael, shouldn’t take more than an hour.",2,7,14
Jan, Do you always shut down the entire office when you leave for an hour?,2,7,14
Jan," Oh, no, that’s alright.  I wanna leave straight from there.",2,7,14
Jan," What kinda trouble are you planning on getting in, Michael?",2,7,14
Jan," You’re gonna let me do the talking, we agreed on that.",2,7,14
Jan, No. [To Christian] Thank you very much for meeting with us.  Have you been waiting long?,2,7,14
Jan," Michael, we got divorced, ok? [to Christian] I’m so sorry.  Excuse me.",2,7,14
Jan," Michael. [to hostess] Uh, could we have a table for three, please?",2,7,14
Jan, I thought we could start by going over the needs of the county.,2,7,14
Jan," Christian, you don’t have to listen to this.",2,7,14
Jan," [to waitress]  Excuse me, could I have a vodka tonic, please?  ",2,7,14
Jan," We would probably be upset with ourselves if we went this whole night without talking business, so, Dunder-Mifflin can provide a level of personal service to the county that the warehouse chains just can’t match.",2,7,14
Jan, I don’t think Christian has time for that.,2,7,14
Jan," Oh no, Michael, Michael, please.  No, really.",2,7,14
Jan," He didn’t want kids, but I knew that going into it.  But he also knew that I did.  I guess I thought that he would change his mind; he thought that I would change mine.",2,7,14
Jan, I am really- [Michael kisses Jan] Thrilled. [Michael and Jan kiss again] Let’s go.,2,7,14
Jan," No. No, we won’t be discussing that, Michael.  The only things I wanna talk about during your performance review are your concrete ideas to improve your branch.",2,8,15
Jan," Uh, your review is anything but a formality, Michael.",2,8,15
Jan, I expect you to forget anything that you think may have happened between us and exhibit completely professional behavior.,2,8,15
Jan," Ok, that is an example of completely unprofessional behavior.",2,8,15
Jan," [on phone]  We’ll address this in the meeting then. Ok. Ok, bye-bye. [to Pam]  Could you please tell Michael that I’m here?",2,8,15
Jan," You know Michael, I think I need to make something clear right off the top.  I’m not going to discuss anything with you other than Dunder-Mifflin business.",2,8,15
Jan, So are you still in the middle of the performance reviews then?,2,8,15
Jan," Uh, I’d like to sit in on that meeting [to Pam] is it happening right now?",2,8,15
Jan, You’re gonna sit here and I’m gonna go sit over there.,2,8,15
Jan," Because nothing did, Michael.  It, I’m not going to say anything more about it, and I would advise that you do the same",2,8,15
Jan," Is this how you’ve been conducting all the reviews, Michael?",2,8,15
Jan," [Dwight opens door] Thank you, Dwight.  				",2,8,15
Jan," Look, I know it’s your job, I know you have to ask, but I promise you, I’m not gonna discuss it with him, I’m certainly not gonna discuss it with you.  [digs a cigarette out of her purse] Do you have a light?  				",2,8,15
Jan, I’m heading back to New York; Alan and I will conduct your performance review over the phone tomorrow.,2,8,15
Jan," Michael, now is not the time or the place.",2,8,15
Jan," No, I am saying we are never having this conversation.",2,8,15
Jan," Never, for me, always means ‘never ever ever.’",2,8,15
Jan," With your looks, ok?  It’s your personality.  I mean, you’re obnoxious, and rude, and, and, and stupid, and you do have coffee breath, by the way, and, and I don’t agree about the b.o., but you are very, very inconsiderate.",2,8,15
Jan," Really.  You’re, you’re, you’re a great guy, ok?",2,8,15
Jan," And you were very sweet, and you stayed up with me and talked with me, cried with me, and I appreciate that-",2,8,15
Jan," At this time in my life.  I just am not in the place right now where I’m looking for a relationship, so we can still work together, we can still be friends but… ok?",2,8,15
Jan," Women today, though we have the same options as men, we often face a very different set of obstacles in getting there. So… ",2,15,22
Jan, Michael… I thought we agreed you wouldn’t be here.,2,15,22
Jan, Now you’re really not allowed in this session.,2,15,22
Jan," We’re fine, Michael. We just need you to leave, please.  				",2,15,22
Jan," Ladies, I am so, so sorry. Can we start again? We were on such a roll. I… I… really apologize.",2,15,22
Jan, [in the background] So one obstacle is how assertiveness is perceived differently in men and women. Men who are assertive will be admired. They’re called… anyone?  				,2,15,22
Jan," I don’t know what you’re doing here, Michael,",2,15,22
Jan," Can you please do this somewhere else, Michael?",2,15,22
Jan," Dwight, excellent idea. Go to the warehouse.",2,15,22
Jan," I’m so sorry about that… um… so where were we? Pam, are you okay taking notes then?",2,15,22
Jan, Why don’t we go around the table and all say something that we know we’re good at. I will start. I am good at public speaking.,2,15,22
Jan," Well, I’ll be honest. One of the goals of these women seminars is to feel out if there’s any standouts. Women who could be a valuable addition to our Corporate life.  				",2,15,22
Jan," Great, great. And Pam, what about you? What is your dream?",2,15,22
Jan, You know the company is offering a design training program in New York.,2,15,22
Jan," Well, it’s only on weekends and then a few weeks in New York, but I’m sure that I could ask Corporate to help you out.",2,15,22
Jan, There are always a million reasons not to do something.  				,2,15,22
Jan, All right. Let’s talk about clothing.  				,2,15,22
Jan," Dress for the job you want, not the job you have. All right. You can use your clothing to send a message about your ambitions by wearing clothes that reflect what you aspire to be.  				",2,15,22
Jan, Another issue is inequality of pay between men and women. I’m sure that all of you have felt that before… ,2,15,22
Jan," The cons are that everyone will lose their job. Michael. Everyone. Office, Warehouse. What do you think… the… pros… are… here?",2,15,22
Jan," You got yourself into this Michael, so you get yourself out.",2,15,22
Jan," Sports metaphors are one of the ways women feel left out of the language of the office. Now, I know this might sound silly but a … many women ask to go over it. So… Fumble means… ",2,15,22
Jan," Right. Par for the course is a golf term. It means right on track. Below par means worse. Wait… that should mean better, that doesn’t make sense.",2,15,22
Jan, I don’t know what Michael was talking about. I don’t know.  				,2,15,22
Jan," [in the background] Kelly, I don’t know what Michael’s talking about.",2,15,22
Jan, I think you should all spend a little more time thinking about your careers and less time on personal stuff.,2,15,22
Jan, Okay. Let’s take five. I think we can all use five.,2,15,22
Jan," Excuse me. I’ve been told there’s been some interest in forming a Union and that Michael supported it. Obviously he’s not a friend of yours because he didn’t tell you the facts. So let me. If there is even a whiff of unionizing in this branch, I can guarantee you the branch will be shut down like that [snaps her fingers]. They unionized in Pittsfield and we all know what happened in Pittsfield. It will cost each of you a fortune in legal fees and union dues and that will be nothing compared to the cost of losing your jobs. So I would think long and hard before sacrificing your savings and your futures just to send a message. If you have any further questions you can direct them to… to Michael.  				",2,15,22
Jan," Nervous, no I’m not nervous. Well, I guess I’d be lying if I didn’t say I was a little nervous. Umm, the new CFO is judging me on this too, and well, it is Michael, so. Yeah, I’m very nervous.  				",2,16,23
Jan," Um, I’m sorry, what did you think financial presentation meant?",2,16,23
Jan," Craig, you realize that we’re trying to decide whether if drastic steps need to be taken?",2,16,23
Jan," Well, the point is, is that doesn’t exactly bode well for your branch. ",2,16,23
Jan," NO, NO I’m not, I’m not, I just… I just don’t know what to do anymore, Michael. I mean, we’re all gonna get fired.",2,16,23
Jan," Yeah, Michael – the CFO thinks that we slept together. Do you understand, people get fired for much less? And I just [scratches head] can’t believe that you told everybody and we didn’t even sleep together.",2,16,23
Jan," Oh, God. Michael. It was months ago. It was once, It’s over. Do you understand?",2,16,23
Jan," Oh, Michael. Thank you again for that, really. It was very nice.",2,16,23
Jan," Oh, no, it’s OK. [Puts hand in way of elevator door to stop from closing.] So, uh, Happy valentine’s Day.",2,16,23
Jan," I’m… returning your call, you said it was urgent. ",2,19,26
Jan," [on phone] Yeah, but… Well, the fact of the matter is that your branch is currently number four of the five branches that I oversee.",2,22,29
Jan, I thought that you were their fearless leader.,2,22,29
Jan," You know, I… I thought about it and you are right.",2,22,29
Jan," I could use a little fun. So, I am going to drive up for your Casino Night.",2,22,29
Jan," What are you… Just… Wait, what’re you talking about?",2,22,29
Jan," No. No, you didn’t. Hi, I’m Jan. I’m Michael’s boss.",2,22,29
Jan," Well, it’s part of the job, you know? Keep an eye on things. So… Why not? So, how long have you and Michael been…",2,22,29
Jan, Casino Night in the warehouse. Good sport.,2,22,29
Jan, Fabulous time. I drove two and a half hours to get here.,2,22,29
Jan," Left work early, drove down here. And I am completely underdressed",2,22,29
Jan," It was very late, Jim. Very… Very late and… Have you given any more thought to the transfer?",2,22,29
Jan," So, I just wanted to congratulate you on a fantastic evening. You did the company proud.",2,22,29
Jan," And thanks for inviting me. You were right, I needed it. So, thanks.",2,22,29
Jan, And you guys have a good time together.,2,22,29
Jan," You know, it’s amazing to me that in this day and age, you could be so obtuse about sexual orientation.",3,1,31
Jan," Coming out, is a significant moment for a gay person, and they should be allowed to select the timing and manner of announcing it.",3,1,31
Jan," Michael, your immaturity is extremely disappointing and may even lead to a lawsuit which is the absolute last thing this company needs right now.  Do you understand?  					",3,1,31
Jan," Great, let’s dump our stuff and meet back here in half an hour.",3,2,32
Jan," Michael, um… Jim and Josh are in meetings all day. And I am in and out of meetings. I can’t stay on top of you 24/7.  ",3,2,32
Jan," [Jim, Josh, and Jan walk in the hotel lobby] Josh, um… [Jim continues walking ahead] Why don’t you come up to my room for a couple of minutes and we can just go over the schedule for tomorrow together.",3,2,32
Jan, [putting on a good face] Great! [walks off]  ,3,2,32
Jan, [walking into an empty office because everyone is watching Varsity Blues] Hello?  ,3,3,33
Jan, Hello? [Angela coughs and points to the conference room]  ,3,3,33
Jan, How would a movie increase productivity Michael?  How on earth would it do that?,3,3,33
Jan," You should talk to Michael, and he’ll talk to me, and that way we don’t have to speak to each other.",3,3,33
Jan," Look, I am already an hour outside of Scranton, Dwight, I’m not coming back.",3,3,33
Jan," Dwight, you must feel strongly, to speak with me this way, behind Michael’s back, and turn on so many of your co-workers.  ",3,3,33
Jan, [on speakerphone with Michael] Michael.,3,3,33
Jan, I just had a very interesting conversation with one of your employees.,3,3,33
Jan," No, it wasn’t.  Dwight just told me that he thinks he can run the branch better than you.",3,3,33
Jan, You can’t have people undermining you.  Get control of your branch immediately.  ,3,3,33
Jan," [kills Jim’s character, giggles] Oh, you know what, I gotta see Josh right now, but remind me to tell you what Dwight said to me earlier, okay? You’ll get a big kick out of it. [leaves]",3,3,33
Jan," [on speakerphone] So, I wanted to let you know that we lost Ed Truck.  ",3,4,34
Jan," [on speakerphone] I understand how you feel, Michael.  I really do.  So, would it be helpful to give everyone the day off?",3,4,34
Jan, [scoffs] I’m not sure that’s realistic.,3,4,34
Jan, What the hell are you two talking about?,3,4,34
Jan," You know what, Michael?  I’ve really tried with you today… ",3,4,34
Jan, So call me when you feel like having a real conversation.,3,4,34
Jan," I’m great. So, Pam I would like you to keep a log of everything Michael does hour by hour so we can analyze it at corporate. Ok?",3,5,35
Jan, I am here to tell you that we are closing the Scranton branch.,3,7,37
Jan, The board voted last night to close your branch.,3,7,37
Jan," I’m very sorry. I don’t relish telling you this. You’ve been a big part of this company, and the board asked me to thank you for your years of service.",3,7,37
Jan," A small number of people will be transferred to the Stamford branch, and the rest will be getting severance packages.",3,7,37
Jan," Well, we haven’t made final decisions about personnel yet. But you’re a severance package person.",3,7,37
Jan," Well, it’s not all about numbers, Michael.",3,7,37
Jan, Our CFO believes that Josh is going to play an important role in our company’s future.,3,7,37
Jan," Oh, good. You’re both here. Ready to talk logistics?  				",3,7,37
Jan," So, Josh will be running what is now called Dunder-Mifflin ,Northeast, which is all the offices north of Stamford. And Jim, fi you want the job, you’ll be his number two.",3,7,37
Jan, You leveraged your new position with us into another offer?,3,7,37
Jan," Damn it, Josh. This whole restructuring thing was based around keeping you. I…",3,7,37
Jan," So… we are still scrambling here. But uh, it looks like Scranton is going to absorb Stamford.",3,7,37
Jan," And I know that you just left there a couple of months ago, but we would like to offer you the number two position at that branch.",3,7,37
Jan," Ah. Well, please think about it. And call me. We will do whatever we can to get you to stay.",3,7,37
Jan," [looks around, noticing that no one is working] Wha… what’s going on here?",3,7,37
Jan," Ah, god. Okay. You know what everybody? I’m sure there is a better way to do this but I’ve drive something like 400 miles today and I’m completely exhausted so I’m just gonna tell you. Your branch is not closing; Stamford is closing. Um, for the time being, it seems that all your jobs are safe.  				",3,7,37
Jan," Well, reasons are not important. Would you just call him, please? Wherever he is… and tell him.",3,7,37
Jan," Uh, we don’t know. Probably. A few.  				",3,7,37
Jan, Did you fire Tony Gardner when he was trying to quit?,3,8,38
Jan," Do you realize, Michael, that we now have to pay him severance? ",3,8,38
Jan," What? No. No. No, Jim is your Number Two.",3,8,38
Jan, He’s the only one  who has worked with both groups. I sent you a memo about this. ,3,8,38
Jan, We get that money for hiring an ex-convict.,3,9,39
Jan," Okay, that’s when the branches merged, so Josh must have been taking advantage of this program. Smart move.",3,9,39
Jan," Uh, reformed convict, and, uh, I’m not sure. Though hang on, let me email our HR, stay on the line.",3,9,39
Jan, I was in Scottsdale visiting my sister.,3,11,41
Jan," Very sunny. Family’s important. Michael, I would like to speak with you, in your office.",3,11,41
Jan," In the last year, I’ve gone through a divorce, an identity theft, a husband who would not… communicate. This is nether here or there. My psychiatrist thinks that I have some self-destructive tendencies and that for once, I should indulge them. You following me? ",3,11,41
Jan," I think I owe it to myself to find some kind of happiness, you know? I mean, even, even if it means… lowering my expectations or, or redefining the word, itself. ",3,11,41
Jan," This is the kind of thing, you know? I am… attracted to you. I, I don’t know why, I… but, I am. And, I need to follow my instincts. At least that’s what Dr. Perry thinks. ",3,11,41
Jan," This is the point, OK? You’re wrong for me. In… In… every way. But I still find myself wanting to… be with you.",3,11,41
Jan," Well, good, OK. Thank you… for taking the time… ",3,11,41
Jan," Wait 15 minutes, find an excuse, and meet me at your condo. ",3,11,41
Jan," Dwight’s name is on the security sign-in sheet, but I don’t know who he met with. And where it asks to state your business, he wrote “Beeswax. Not yours, Inc.”",3,12,42
Jan," [On speaker phone] Michael, I left a meeting.  What is so urgent?  Are you, are you okay?",3,14,44
Jan," Hi, Dwight. Ok, Michael, take me off speaker phone. ",3,17,47
Jan, …and just like rip into each other like we did on that black sand beach in Jamaica. ,3,17,47
Jan," I’m sure that it’s catered. I need you to sign these, Michael. It’s a waver of some of your rights. You should read it carefully. It releases the company in the event that our relationship, in your opinion or in reality, interferes with work. You get a copy, I get a copy, and a third copy goes to HR. ",3,17,47
Jan, You realize this is a legal document that says you can’t sue the company. ,3,17,47
Jan," I am taking a calculated risk. What’s the upside? I overcome my nausea, fall deeply in love, babies, normalcy, no more self loathing. Downside? I, uh, date Michael Scott publicly and collapse in on myself like a dying star.   ",3,17,47
Jan, Why is this so hard? That’s what she said. Oh my God. What am I saying?   ,3,17,47
Jan," Oh, no. Michael, please. Michael, please.   ",3,17,47
Jan," Of course, of course, David. Do you remember Michael Scott?",3,17,47
Jan," David, can I, um, speak to you privately for just a moment, please. ",3,17,47
Jan," We’re good. [Michael tries to kiss Jan] Michael, stop. Please stop that, ok?",3,17,47
Jan," I, Michael, I think David probably wants to spend Christmas here with his family. ",3,17,47
Jan, I’m sorry. You’re just going to have to excuse us for just a couple minutes.,3,17,47
Jan," Sorry. Michael, come here. Just, just, just, just. [kisses Michael]",3,17,47
Jan," Slam me up against the wall, right here.",3,17,47
Jan," Oh, I’m acting inappropriate? Get out.   ",3,17,47
Jan," No, we were good when we were just running around, you know, in secret. It was wrong and it was exciting. Maybe it was a mistake to take it public.",3,17,47
Jan," It was never a love contract, Michael and besides, I have already given a copy to David and it would be just as embarrassing to get it back as I was handing it to him.",3,17,47
Jan," Tired. I’m tired. And I didn’t eat enough. And, and, that’s all. That was it.",3,17,47
Jan, That’s all. I didn’t mean it. That’s all. I’m just saying I didn’t mean it. ,3,17,47
Jan," Michael, last Friday one of your employees attacked another employee in your office!",3,18,48
Jan," All right, well are you gonna take care of this?",3,18,48
Jan, I told you not to say it.  Do you remember that?,3,18,48
Jan," Why don’t we talk next month, after the quarter ends?",3,18,48
Jan," Today.  All right, well, uh, if you want to do it today, we should meet in person, and uh, can you get here by five?",3,18,48
Jan," Great.  Uh, and listen.  Because of our, uh, our… you know, situation, we’re gonna need to have a third party present.",3,18,48
Jan," No, Michael. We, we need an HR rep.  So, uh, I think you should just bring Toby.  ",3,18,48
Jan," …and we need someone else, in the room, because of our relationship.  You know this.  Michael, either Toby comes with you, or we don’t do it.  ",3,18,48
Jan," Thank you, Hunter. [to Michael and Toby] Hello.  Come in.  [exhales] Ah, Okay.",3,18,48
Jan, I have to call you the second I get a new assistant?,3,18,48
Jan," Hi, Toby. [clears throat] First— [Michael clears his throat] First off, Michael, this is a salary negotiation.  All matters regarding our personal relationship have to be set aside.  Are we clear?",3,18,48
Jan," Okay, Michael.  Please, why don’t we just take a break.  This is really going nowhere.",3,18,48
Jan," Okay, Michael.  I can offer you a 12% raise, but you have got to ask for 15.",3,18,48
Jan," No, just… I just need you to ask for it, so I can record that you asked for it.  Okay?",3,18,48
Jan," …come over after work tonight, OK? I miss your body.",3,21,51
Jan," I’ll give you $200. And if I get up before you, I’ll leave it on the dresser.",3,21,51
Jan," You know whatever. Just let my assistant know if you’re coming over so he can get more vodka, OK? Hunter, are you on?",3,21,51
Jan," Michael… [clears throat] I was, um… I was really unhappy with our conversation earlier. And I… I just – I couldn’t stop thinking about it. So I decided that I would drive down here and apologize to you in person. So… [takes Michael’s hand] I’m sorry.",3,21,51
Jan," [cell phone vibrates] Oh. Hold on, I’m sorry.",3,21,51
Jan," One second. Oh! It’s from you. Uh, you wanna grab some dinner?",3,21,51
Jan," OK. [voice on phone] “It’s me, Michael. I’m just calling to say that I think we need a little break, permanently. And, uh, I know everybody says this, but I want…”",3,21,51
Jan," I’m great. Uh, can we, can we talk… privately… for a minute?  ",3,23,53
Jan," I just, [quietly] I uh… I don’t uh… I, I don’t, I don’t like the way that we left things. ",3,23,53
Jan," Sorry to drop by unexpectedly. I uh, I tried calling, but I kept getting voice mail. ",3,23,53
Jan," After you ended… everything with us, I went on a vacation. ",3,23,53
Jan," It was.  Yeah, it was good. [laughs] I think I’ll just get right to the point, you know?  Um, I, I feel good about myself for the first time in a really long time. ",3,23,53
Jan, I’ve made some big changes in my life and… I miss you. I want us to get back together. ,3,23,53
Jan, Ohh… [Michael leaves and walks into conference room]  				,3,23,53
Jan, So… [exhales] there are a lot of things that I would like to do differently.,3,23,53
Jan," I feel like, when we first got together, that I had a problem with my priorities.",3,23,53
Jan, And if we could talk about a way to approach a possible reconciliation…,3,23,53
Jan," Well, I um, I have to get back, but I will see you in New York tomorrow, right? ",3,23,53
Jan, Good luck with your interview. [whispers] Bye.  				,3,23,53
Jan, Oh. [they kiss] I’ll put in a good word for you.,3,23,53
Jan, What’s… what’s the matter?  What… what happened in there?,3,23,53
Jan, [opens up her overcoat] Is it because of these?,3,23,53
Jan," No, I wanna know.  I wanna know!  Because if it is, then, then, then I will see you in court!",3,23,53
Jan," ‘Cause he likes them. [points to Michael] Okay? He likes them. And, and that is, that is all I care about.",3,23,53
Jan," Okay, you know what?  I’m just not leaving.  I’m not leaving.  Not leaving.",3,23,53
Jan," Don’t let them change you, okay? [Jan drops several items, Michael and Hunter help pick them up, she starts to walk out the door] So long, [censored].",3,23,53
Jan," Oh, God!  I mean, I just don’t understand!  It’s just ",3,23,53
Jan," Oh, just… No, actually I think it’s good, you know?  It’s fine, actually, I do.  I really think it’s great that it happened.  Because, you know, my work has always been the thing that has gotten in the way of my happiness, so… [laughs]",3,23,53
Jan," [sobbing] Oh, I know, I know.  It’s just… I’m sorry.  It’s just these painkillers that I started taking since the surgery.  Ohhh!  They make my moods totally unpredictable!  Wow!  What am I gonna do?",3,23,53
Jan," Live together.  Actually, wait a minute!  This could be great!  This could be perfect!  You know, my full-time job could be our relationship.  I could wear stretch pants and wait for you to come home at 5:15. [laughs] It could work.  This could work, really!  				",3,23,53
Jan, So I heard that you were peeping on Michael.,4,1,55
Jan," I don’t know what your deal is, but he’s mine, OK? So hands off.",4,1,55
Jan," Water? Water? [Toby gabs water, drinks, then throws back at Jan] Water babe?",4,1,55
Jan," Well, not exactly my job… I had a different title.",4,2,56
Jan," Different salary. [laughs] You’ll get there, don’t worry.",4,2,56
Jan, You know what? I love the beard. Keep it forever. [goes into Michael’s office],4,2,56
Jan, I hope he’s gets hit with an ageism suit.,4,2,56
Jan," Ageism? Companies they can’t discriminate against people due to old age. Like a couple years ago we tried to force out some of the older branch managers with a mandatory retirement age and then Ed Truck, your old boss, threatened us with a lawsuit, so we had to back off.",4,2,56
Jan,"  [on phone] My friends?  Michael, I was terminated.",4,3,57
Jan," Well, they both go with the carpet I’ve ordered, and if you go with the brown leather on the sofas, then they go with that too.",4,4,58
Jan, Conniving little runt. Put him through. ,4,4,58
Jan," So, um, I forgot to tell you that I need the car tonight.",4,4,58
Jan," Why? Improv? Why don’t you just pretend you have a car? Good practice, incase you ever do a scene where you need to pretend you have a car?  ",4,4,58
Jan," [on phone] Michael, how did this happen?  Where did all your money go?  I don’t, I don’t get this.  I really don’t.  I don’t know how you could be so irresponsible.  I mean, this is, it is astounding to me, really.  I don’t know what more to say.",4,4,58
Jan," [on phone] Well, is he coming right back?",4,4,58
Jan," Well, why are you sitting on a train?  Where are you going?",4,4,58
Jan," Michael, come on.  Running away from your problems won’t solve anything.  You know that.",4,4,58
Jan," Your creditors can follow you anywhere with ease.  Your debt follows you around the world, electronically.",4,4,58
Jan," Uh, Michael, come on, come on, you can deal with this.  It’s not that bad.",4,4,58
Jan," Well, when my life fell apart and they, and they screwed me in New York, and I felt like my whole world was collapsing around me, I didn’t have anyone.  I mean, my whole family still won’t even talk to me, on the advice of counsel, and my friends were just waiting for this to happen.",4,4,58
Jan," Michael, no, what I want to say is you were there for me.  By my side.  Without even a thought.  That’s just who you are.  I mean, no matter how badly I treat you, or what I’m going through, you just, you are there for me.  And that is a guy worth staying beside.  So, where’s this train taking us?",4,4,58
Jan, I’m keeping them. I know you like them. They’re kind of uncomfortable though.,4,4,58
Jan, It’s kind of painful and my nipples are over-sensitive now.,4,4,58
Jan,  I need you to make me 100 copies of this on canary yellow.,5,1,63
Jan,"  Oh, great. Yeah, Serenity by Jan is kicking ass and taking names. You remember last week when that girl went missing?  Guess whose candles they used for the vigil?",5,1,63
Jan," Well, um, you know, labor just kind of started very suddenly and-",5,3,65
Jan," And the birth instructor thought it wasn’t a good idea for you to be there, so…",5,3,65
Jan," OK, you don’t have any idea what I’ve been through, so, let’s…",5,3,65
Jan," I’m sorry, I thought today at the baby shower would be a good time for the two of you to meet.",5,3,65
Jan," Yes, yes you can. You know, I think, just leave her in the car seat. Yeah.",5,3,65
Jan," Michael, Michael, Michael, that’s… yeah… that’s too high.  I’ll take that.",5,3,65
Jan, [singing “Son of a Preacher Man” to Astrid] Being good isn’t always easy / No matter how hard I try / When he started sweet-talking to me / He’d come and tell me everything is all right / He’d kiss and tell me everything is all right / Can I get away again tonight / The only one…   				,5,3,65
Jan," [now belting out the lyrics, even though Astrid is asleep] How well I remember / The look that was in his eyes / Stealing kisses from me on the sly / Taking time to make time / Telling me that he’s all mine / Learning from each other’s knowing / Looking to see how much we’ve grown / And the only one…   				",5,3,65
Jan," Well, actually, I, uh, I had a tub birth.  And it was really, really quite amazing.",5,3,65
Jan," Yeah, it’s a really nice transition from womb to world, you know, kind of like a big womb.",5,3,65
Jan," Oh no, it’s actually really hygienic, Creed.",5,3,65
Jan, And after the birth you get out and deliver the afterbirth. [everyone starts leaving],5,3,65
Jan," You’re sad about this.  I know that, and I wish that I…  but…  would it help if you held Astrid for just a, a little bit?",5,3,65
Jan," All right.  Um, I’m just going to lie down for a couple of minutes.  I’m exhausted, so um.  Remind me to talk to you about Astrid’s 529.  Wake me in twenty.",5,3,65
Jan, [wakes up on the reception couch] Oh. I was just catching up on my sleep.,5,3,65
Jan, What are you doing? What’s going on? Excuse me.,5,3,65
Jan, You don’t flash around a newborn baby.  Don’t you know that?  				,5,3,65
Jan," Oh, no, Michael, you know what? I really have to go.",5,3,65
Jan," You know what, where is the stroller that I came in with?",5,3,65
Jan," OK.  You know what?  There is, uh, there is one more thing that you can do for me.  ",5,3,65
Jan, Thanks for the baby shower.  It was great.  And I’ll see you… soon.,5,3,65
Jan," [to a client] …to accommodate the, uh, suppliers. [Seeing Michael and Dwight] Gentlemen! Nice to see you, it’ll be just a moment. If you could show them into Conference Room B. [to client again] The pharmaceutical aspects should be able to…  				",7,4,109
Jan," How do I do it? Raise my daughter, work as director of office purchasing for this hospital and release an album of Dorris Day covers on my own label? If I knew I’d tell you.  				",7,4,109
Jan," Yeah I’m really happy. Me and Astrid against the world. [laughs] We’re loving it, yeah. I’m kind of a supermom.",7,4,109
Jan, Yeah. [singing] Fry it up in a pan. Never never never let you forget… [laughs] I love that commercial.,7,4,109
Jan," Well, Michael, it was nice to get your call.",7,4,109
Jan, Are you gonna keep me in suspense? [Michael sighs],7,4,109
Jan," Michael Scott, you are here for a post mortem.",7,4,109
Jan," You wanna dig into our relationship, go over it, see what killed it. Ok, I’m in.  				",7,4,109
Jan, Well if there’s anything exciting about it it’s because we both knew it was wrong!,7,4,109
Jan," No, ok. Imagine there’s a princess, who falls for a guy beneath her station, and the queen doesn’t like this at all. And the princess knows that the queen doesn’t like it so it just makes her wanna do it all the more just to get at the queen!",7,4,109
Jan," You might have learned shapes, or blocks, or clocks, or colors. Or you might have learned that we’re all, sisters and brothers.",7,4,109
Jan," [acting as a jazz singer at the Funky Cat, singing] They call me Jasmine Winsong.",7,16,121
Jan," He finished his movie? [frantically trying to open her car door, as if trying to get away from the camera crew] No kidding. Wow, that’s great. Yeah that’s good for him.  ",7,16,121
Jan, [singing gibberish while laying on the piano on stage],7,16,121
Jan, [michael pushes the backwards button on the recorder] The hostages are under the stadium. [An assassin with a golden tie shoots her with a tranquilizer and she falls],7,16,121
Erin, [eating cake with Kelly] I am so happy you’re eating again.,6,1,81
Erin," Michael, Teri Hudson returning your call.",6,1,81
Erin,   Should I tell him you’ll call him back?  ,6,2,82
Erin," [at the door] Dwight, Jim wants you to keep it down.  				",6,3,83
Erin, David Wallace is on line two for you guys. ,6,3,83
Erin," Wallace sent an e-mail about a meeting next week. He wants you both to respond. [Michael and Jim leave, Dwight sneaks in]   				",6,3,83
Erin," Dunder Mifflin Scranton will be closed today and Friday for a company wedding in Niagara Falls. So, please leave a message and we’ll get back to you as soon as possible. Have a great day.  				",6,4,84
Erin, Oh no. That wouldn’t be fair to leave Kelly alone in back.  				,6,4,84
Erin, [everyone is dancing] Go Meredith. Nice moves.,6,4,84
Erin,  If you want to sit on this– [hands Andy her wrap] I was thinking the wood might be too hard on your damaged penis.  Make it softer.  ,6,4,84
Erin,  Do you think they canceled the wedding?  ,6,4,84
Erin," [Michael walks in office, man waits on couch] Mr. Grotti, this is Michael Scott. He’s the person you should talk to.",6,5,85
Erin, In your schedule it just says nine til noon is “creative space” and I thought this could be part of that.,6,5,85
Erin, You don’t have anything in the afternoon. It just says “free play.”,6,5,85
Erin," Oh, um, let me just check with Michael first.",6,6,86
Erin," [laughs] I think it will too, but I’ll just check with him, though.",6,6,86
Erin," Oops, sorry. [slides candy back to Pam] Oops.   				",6,6,86
Erin," Sure. Oh, is it okay if I put out some candy that Pam brought back from Puerto Rico?",6,6,86
Erin," Pam, we’re all set. [Pam places candy on Erin’s desk] Yum.  				",6,6,86
Erin," Michael, you’re all set at Botticelli’s. I changed the reservation to two people.",6,6,86
Erin, I confirmed with Raskin Design and they’re expecting the both of you in an hour.,6,7,87
Erin," [Michael is walking around in one of Jim’s suits] Um, Michael? The custodian from Raskin Design is on the line. He said they found your keys in the Koi pond.",6,7,87
Erin," Staples? [Kevin clears his throat] Uh, David Wallace called.",6,7,87
Erin," He heard you made a big splash at the meeting. Oh, my God. That was so mean what I just said and I didn’t mean it. It was Kevin and Meredith put me up to it.",6,7,87
Erin," Um, Michael? The custodian called again. Apparently a Koi has died. [everyone shows remorse]",6,7,87
Erin," Well, they said you stepped on it’s head. He did not suffer.",6,7,87
Erin," Oh, sure. Oh, wait. Hand them to me upside down so I don’t accidentally read them.",6,7,87
Erin," How did today go, by the way? Did you make any sales?",6,7,87
Erin," He’s, like, the coolest person I’ve ever met.",6,7,87
Erin, Oh. Do you mean Marlon Wayans? ‘Cause he is.,6,7,87
Erin,  These are amazing.  You took all these?,6,8,88
Erin," Oh, wait. Um– Swartz Lumber is on the phone for you Pam and they say it’s urgent.    ",6,8,88
Erin,  Your feelings journal?  You told me to put it in the time capsule.,6,9,89
Erin,"  Naughty Nellie Nutmeg, a vivacious young socialite with a penchant for scandal.",6,9,89
Erin,"  Well, you know ol’ Nellie’s always up for a romp in the hay.",6,9,89
Erin,  [accent] Savannah?  That’s a far way from Scranton.,6,9,89
Erin,"  I thought it was for real.  So I was excited, but it was just, it was part of the game.  				",6,9,89
Erin,  Wallace is on the phone.  He’s returning your call.,6,9,89
Erin,  I don’t think so.  I think it’s David Wallace from Dunder Mifflin.,6,9,89
Erin, It’s like what high school kids take to prom on tv shows.,6,10,90
Erin, Frankie’s Dirty Joke of the Day?  There’s a bunch of those.,6,11,91
Erin, There’s a bunch of Sent e-mails that jusy say “Delivered.”  Should I delete all of those?,6,11,91
Erin, That’s why you have a “Sent Mail” folder.,6,11,91
Erin, There’s about 30 news alerts for “Nip Slip.”,6,11,91
Erin," Hey Pam, do you have a sec to check over this inventory?",6,11,91
Erin," Oh, did you really look it over?  Felt like maybe you didn’t.",6,11,91
Erin, I can print out a new itinerary with Pam’s name on it.,6,11,91
Erin, [points to a sign saying The Michael Gary Scott Reading Room] You’re famous.,6,11,91
Erin," Hey Mr. Scott, What you gonna do, What you gonna do make our dreams come true.  Hey Mr. Scott, What you gonna do—",6,11,91
Erin," No, there’s financial aid, uh, they could join the army or the navy.",6,11,91
Erin," The principal told me that 90% of Scott’s Tots are on track to graduate, and that’s 35% higher than the rest of the school.  So I think if you hadn’t made that promise, a lot of them would’ve dropped out.  Which is something to think about, I think.",6,11,91
Erin, I’ve always wondered what it might be like to be an accountant.,6,11,91
Erin," Hello. Sorry guys. [louder, face is scratched up.] Sorry guys. I’m not sure I’ve earned the right to make announcements yet. But whoever is giving me the Twelve Days of Christmas? As my Secret Santa? Please stop. I can’t take it anymore. My cat killed a turtledove; the French hens have started pulling out my hair to make a nest. Please. Stop.",6,12,92
Erin, I keep trying to figure out who’s sending me these gifts.,6,12,92
Erin," Is it you? [Andy stage face, eyes pop, big mouth smile, Erin laughs]",6,12,92
Erin, Do you want me off the call too Michael?,6,12,92
Erin, What were you thinking? [Andy freezes]  ,6,12,92
Erin," Guys, um, who’s Gabe? This note says to put the box aside for Gabe Lewis, who’s coming tomorrow?  				",6,14,94
Erin, I think when Andy finally asks me out he’s going to try to top what he did with the drum line. I can’t wait to see what he comes up with.  				,6,14,94
Erin," [opening card] Oh, you did? Aw, a bird and a dog!",6,15,95
Erin," Uh, yeah I do remember. [reading card] Aw, they love each other.",6,15,95
Erin," Michael, I’m worried that, uh, not all your toys are gonna fit on your new desk.",6,15,95
Erin," Well, in your old office there were all those ledges and extra space.",6,15,95
Erin," You know, I actually think I should get back to work. Jim asked me to do some stuff, and he’s manager.",6,15,95
Erin, It’s ants on a log. Michael would always have me bring them in at 2:30 and say “Who’s hungry?”,6,15,95
Erin, Do you want me to spin you in your chair and make you dizzy?,6,15,95
Erin," It’s a thinking technique. All the top executives do it. It keeps the brain moving, and a spinning brain is a working brain.",6,15,95
Erin, Friends are worth sharing a doghouse with.  				,6,15,95
Erin," It’s no wonder that Andy gave Kelly such a romantic card. I can’t compete with her. That girl can sing, and dance, and gets all of her clothes at the mall. And I feel like such a fool for thinking that Andy was only going after one girl, cause Andy Bernard is a playboy. And, why shouldn’t he be? He’s got it all.  				",6,15,95
Erin," Yeah, I guess Andy never liked Kelly. How about that?  				",6,15,95
Erin," Sure does! Okay, we have your space heater, your humidifier, your dehumidifier, your fan, your foot fan, and your food dehydrator.",6,15,95
Erin," Oh! [hits another key, they awkwardly dance together]  				",6,15,95
Erin,  I thought you said your younger brother was named Walter Jr.,6,16,96
Erin,  [naming race horses]  Affirmed.  Seattle Slew.  Secretariat.  Citation.  Assault.  Count Fleet.  Whirlaway.  War Admiral.  Omaha.  Gallant Fox…  And…  I know this.  Uh…  The jockey was Johnny Loftus.  Sired by Star Shoot.  				,6,16,96
Erin,"  Okay, uh, the second one is walk around.  We’re already doing the opposite of that.  Perfect.  Okay, number three, eat spicy foods.",6,16,96
Erin,  [in Michael’s office]  You wanted to see me?,6,16,96
Erin,"  Michael, could I talk to you privately?",6,16,96
Erin,"  I’m so sorry if I gave you the impression I’m into Kevin, but I’m not.  I like Andy.",6,16,96
Erin,"  So, you must have grown up around somewhere else?",6,16,96
Erin,  I have really enjoyed our time together.,6,16,96
Erin,  I want to continue working on our friendship.,6,16,96
Erin,  Because I think our friendship could be a really cool thing.,6,16,96
Erin,"  And I hope that I’m your friend…  And, maybe…",6,16,96
Erin,"  It’s busy.  Why don’t I keep trying, and then I’ll give you the confirmation in a bit?",6,16,96
Erin,  [tearing up]  You can’t talk to me like that.  I didn’t do anything wrong.  I’ve been having a tough day today.,6,16,96
Erin,"  Oh, my God.  That’s amazing.  Let me just fax this, and I’ll check my planner.",6,16,96
Erin," Oh, no I’m fine, I just have a little indigestion. ",6,17,97
Erin, Yes.  [Angela returns to desk and puts embroidered breathing mask on]  				,6,17,97
Erin," I’m a little sick but I don’t want to miss my date with Andy. I’ll get better. Whenever I’m sick it goes away within a few hours. Except once, when I was in the hospital from age three to six.  				",6,17,97
Erin, Oh! No. I feel like I could lift a car.,6,17,97
Erin," You’re awake. Andy, this is my brother, Reid.",6,17,97
Erin," Hey! My feet aren’t smelly, they smell like roses. Smell them! [puts her feet in his face]",6,17,97
Erin, None. We were in the same house from ages ten to twelve. And then from fifteen to eighteen.,6,17,97
Erin," Yes. Thank you, for coming all the way here.",6,17,97
Erin, I’m so sorry I was so sick. [Andy leans in. She leans in. Reid appears in background. Erin kisses Andy on the cheek.],6,17,97
Erin," Something came for you, Michael. [hands him a parcel]",6,18,98
Erin, Yeah. I basically wish you were dead. [grins] I hid the leads.,6,18,98
Erin," [mimes zipping mouth and throwing away key, Andy begins to walk away] Colder. Colder. Warmer. Warmer. Colder. Colder. Warmer. Warmer. Warmer. Hot. [Andy hovers his hands above her chest] Hotter. Pretty hot. Lower. ",6,18,98
Erin," Lower [tilts head toward her desk, then flips over her keyboard, revealing the leads. Andy scratches his head, recovering]  				",6,18,98
Erin, I emptied it in the dumpster. With Toby’s baba ganoush.  				,6,18,98
Erin, [strips off jacket] Go on. I have warm blood. [tries to drape her small jacket across Andy’s back],6,18,98
Erin,"Talk to me that way again, and I’ll cut your face off. ",6,19,99
Erin,"[Erin sits with man, rubs her hand on his thigh] Hey, big boy. Do you like it when I do that?",6,19,99
Erin, I know that Erin would be so psyched if you took her out to lunch.,6,20,100
Erin," Well, happy Boss’s day. There wouldn’t be a secretary if there was no boss.",6,20,100
Erin, I got a picture of you asking me to lunch. I was thinking we could go to Hayworth’s. ,6,20,100
Erin," Yeah, okay. Yeah that was a stupid suggestion. I was thinking someplace special, so I though Hayworth’s, but…",6,20,100
Erin, I was thinking it would be fun to talk on the way over. So what decade would you have chosen to be a teenager?,6,20,100
Erin," [at lunch] And then my last job was at a Taco Bell express. But then it became a full Taco Bell, and I don’t know, I couldn’t keep up. My favorite part about being a receptionist is that I get to have my own desk. In my Foster home I never had a desk. [Michael keeps moving around, very clearly bored and annoyed]. So it’s like… I don’t mean that I didn’t like my foster home. I did like it. I just didn’t have a desk there. Did you have a favorite age? Or month? ",6,20,100
Erin," Yeah, like a favorite month. Like I like April when I was seven.  				",6,20,100
Erin, How many pillows do you sleep on at night?,6,20,100
Erin, He’s the best boyfriend in the world. Tell me about him before I met him.,6,20,100
Erin, Sorry. About Angela? Did you say he dated Angela?,6,20,100
Erin," [face looks disgusted, moves around uncomfortably] Uh-oh…",6,20,100
Erin," In the Foster home, my hair was my room. [exhales, prolonged exclaiming]",6,20,100
Erin," God, Oscar, will you keep your pants on? It’s easy.  				",6,20,100
Erin, [throws a piece of cake at Andy’s face] I know about Angela! I know that you were engaged to her and that you were sleeping with her! Michael told me.,6,20,100
Erin, I don’t want to be in private. Is it true or is it not?,6,20,100
Erin, Who else did you sleep with? Did you sleep with Phyllis or Kelly or Pam? Maybe all together?,6,20,100
Erin, Did everyone know? Was I the only one who didn’t know?,6,20,100
Erin, Who are you?! I don’t know you! [pushes someone away to leave]  				,6,20,100
Erin," You want to talk to me, come to my desk.",6,20,100
Erin, Oh. Take it up with the chief of police.,6,20,100
Erin, I want to throw up just thinking about it. ,6,20,100
Erin, I hope you find what you’re looking for.,6,20,100
Erin, Trust is the most important thing to me. Is your name Andy Bernard? What’s your real name? Lionel Frankenstein?,6,20,100
Erin, I think I have to be on my own for a little bit. Like the girl Precious in Precious. Based on the novel Push by Sapphire. Ok?,6,20,100
Erin," Michael, I think Donna left this here. Should I put it in the lost and found for 14 days and then I can take it home?",6,21,101
Erin," Oh, my God, thank you so much. I love that denim jumpsuit you have. How much?",6,21,101
Erin, Kelly got into the minority training program. ,6,21,101
Erin, Maybe you’d be more comfortable in your own office.,6,22,102
Erin," Uh, no. [Michael sighs, Donna enters] Wait, yes.",6,22,102
Erin,  It’s so exciting Pam. The Eagles are doing a theme of ice creams in honor of turning 60.,6,23,103
Erin,  Do you want me to go back to the store?,6,23,103
Erin,  This is all for Michael. It turns out his girlfriend was married.,6,23,103
Erin,"  After his last breakup, he ate 40,000 calories in three hours. Right, Pam? That’s what Pam told me.",6,23,103
Erin,"  That’s okay. You probably shouldn’t keep a baby up that late, though.   				",6,23,103
Erin,  We have Mr. Bean playing in the conference room and the Pink Panther movie in his office. With half hour shifts to watch it with him.,6,23,103
Erin," [on phone] Ryan, you have a Woof on line 1.",6,24,104
Erin, I wanted to say that I think it was very brave of you to go to the press.,6,24,104
Erin," Gabe is awesome. He has accomplished so much career-wise and height-wise. Thank God he’s my boss because I would not have said yes to a first date if I didn’t have to, but… it’s been great.  				",7,1,106
Erin," Oh my gosh, those are the pants he wanted to return to Talbots. ",7,1,106
Erin," I’m sorry, do you want to try them on again to see.",7,1,106
Erin,"  Dwight [snaps a picture with a disposable camera, then drops the camera in the trash can]  				",7,2,107
Erin,"  Disposable cameras are fun, although it does seem wasteful and you don’t ever get to see your pictures. If it’s an important even that you want to remember, I recommend using a real camera. But I don’t care if I forget today.  				",7,2,107
Erin, Who is he? [rest of Sweeney Todd cast enters and continues singing],7,3,108
Erin, I am so excited. But I just need one. Gabe can’t come. Sorry.,7,3,108
Erin," I really wanted to see Andy’s play, because he’s so, so talented. But I’ve been trying to get in the babysitting game forever. The thirteen-year-olds in this town have a complete monopoly. It’s almost like a babysitters club.   				",7,3,108
Erin, I just didn’t think that you guys were gonna see us. We were just gonna stop by and get some ice cream and then go home.,7,3,108

Erin," Oh, no, why would I take her to the hospital? ",7,3,108
Erin," Why don’t I just take her home and let you guys finish, and then you should stay out as late as you want.",7,3,108
Erin," Yes. Oh, I’m so scared! Okay, kill me! Just kill me! Kill me!",7,3,108
Erin," Oh, no. I’m so glad we’re hanging out again outside of work.",7,3,108
Erin," This is awesome. [cell phone rings] Sorry. Hi, Gabe. Yeah, I just stopped by Andy’s cast party to say hi to everyone. Oh, sure, I can pick you up some soup. What do you want?

Erin," Oh, Lake Wobblegone’s on. Do you guys-are you cool with that?",7,7,112
Erin," Gabe and I are having a party, and everyone’s invited, and it’s at his house apartment and we’re gonna watch Glee.",7,8,113
Erin, Uhh. It’s just that it’s our first party together so…,7,8,113
Erin," I don’t know if Michael likes Gabe that much, but there’s this thing on Glee called mash-up, where two things that don’t go together, make one great song. Take Gabe, take Michael, you make Gay Mike. Best friends.  				",7,8,113
Erin, You and Michael are always the life of the party!,7,8,113
Erin, [to Michael at Gabe’s apartment] It’s make your own pizza night. Isn’t Gabe’s place so nice?,7,8,113
Erin, Look at the size of those wine glasses Michael!,7,8,113
Erin, Those posters used to be real French ads.,7,8,113

Erin," Michael knows everything there is to know about snacks,",7,8,113
Erin, Gabe was born in 1982. He was the longest baby in the hospital.,7,8,113

Erin, [concerned] Are you having a good time?,7,8,113
Erin, [Michael is outside fixing the cable box] You did this?,7,8,113
Erin," [slowly getting it] Uhm, I’m not going to my room.",7,8,113

Erin," According to the internet, the tallest man in the world is Chinese.",7,10,115
Erin," What if we all get together and help each other and hire a new guy, and then we all kill him, but first we take out like a hundred thousand dollar life insurance policy. I bet you guys like that idea don’t you?  				",7,10,115
Erin," I think that’s what they’re doing to me. I can’t prove it, but I wanted to see their faces when I said it. I learned nothing.  				",7,10,115
Erin, I’ve looked her up online… there’s nothing about her. She’s made no impression on the internet.,7,11,116
Erin," I’m really sorry, I can’t help you. I’m waiting for my boss’ pretty friend to arrive.",7,11,116
Erin," To throw out? Or put out, like, six pieces for everyone?",7,11,116

Erin," I don’t get it! I’m sorry. I just, I don’t get it!  				",7,11,116
Erin, That’s not true. I don’t know her enough to make a decision even.,7,11,116

Erin," [giggles] Snot.  Sorry, it sounded like you said it’s snot.  I am so sorry.",7,12,117
Erin," I’m really excited for Michael either way. Because if Holly chooses to be with him, he will be so, so happy. And if not, he’ll be avoiding the biggest mistake of his life!  				",7,12,117
Erin," Well, my goal was to learn a new word every single day. And I must say that it is going immensely.",7,12,117

Erin," The winner gets to pick the movie we watch. I have won no games. So far I’ve seen “The Shining”, “Rosemary’s Baby”, “The Ring”. Not really my thing. Although, I… I do like the early parts of the movies where they have a perfect family and everything.   ",7,13,118
Erin," Because I’m playing to win. I’m playing “moo”, I’m playing “milk”. Whatever it takes. ",7,13,118

Erin," Got it. [plays word] Oh, Oscar. Oscar?   ",7,13,118
Erin, Holly is ruining Michael’s life. He thinks she is so special. And she’s so not. Her personality is like a 3. Her sense of humor is a 2. Her ears are like a 7and a 4. Add it all up and what do you get? 16. And he treats her like she’s a perfect 40. It’s nuts.    ,7,14,119
Erin, You know what? Why don’t you stay and I’ll go?,7,14,119
Erin, It’s kind of a sketchy neighborhood though. I better come along. ,7,14,119

Erin, That’s Gabe’s boom box. Come on. We have to go find it. ,7,15,120
Erin, [softly] Not if we’re talking like this. I think it’s okay. He doesn’t seem to hear us. ,7,15,120
Erin, Okay. Then no more talking. Let’s just play the song. ,7,15,120
Erin, I guess we just have to wait until night and see. ,7,15,120
Erin, Yeah. Did you not see it? [“Eat at Hanks” is written in glow-in-the-dark letters above the door],7,15,120
Erin," Oh, yes. There’s a note. “A little cookie for you, my miss. But the real treasure is your Valentine’s kiss.”",7,15,120

Erin, [walking in with Gabe behind her] Sorry we’re late. Gabe fell in the shower.,7,17,122
Erin," Yeah, it took the fire department forever to get there. [realizing there’s a new computer at her desk. Gets very excited] Oh my God, where did this come from?! Who did this?!  				",7,17,122
Erin, Hey sailor! Come watch it over here! [pats her new computer],7,17,122
Erin," [nods] I just thought, he really needed a new computer, and he knew so much about that one.",7,17,122
Erin," [to Holly who is walking by] Oh! If you’re going back to the annex, could you take these to Dwight? I think the ants are waking up. They need to start farming soon. [picks up an ant farm and tube of ants from her desk, Holly takes them] Thanks.",7,17,122
Erin, [looking anxious] If you’re not gonna take the ants over I should probably just do it myself.,7,17,122
Erin, [very anxious at this point] Gee! Uh oh! I think the ants are starting to eat each other!,7,17,122
Erin," [getting up and walking towards them, worriedly] For Pete’s sake it just needs to be done! [takes the ant farm and tube from Holly and heads towards the annex]  				",7,17,122
Erin," Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin. Ok, let me transfer you.",7,19,124

Erin," I, really don’t like spending time with him.",7,20,125
Erin," I can’t just dump him Pam, I’m not like you, I can’t be mean.",7,20,125
Erin," Thank you, thank you! This is the first award I’ve ever won in my entire life. [Gabe and Andy smile at her] People are right about the Dundies, they are magical. But, I don’t feel it. And I think that’s because I’m not with the right person. Gabe, we should break up.",7,20,125
Erin," I’m not attracted to you. I just, I cringe when you talk. I have to be honest. Right, right Pam? [Pam looks very awkward] Thank you for hearing me.",7,20,125
Erin," [walking into the women’s bathroom, Gabe storms in after her] Gabe!",7,21,126
Erin, You can’t be in here. This is a lady’s room!,7,21,126
Erin," Can we talk about this later, I have to go.",7,21,126
Erin," I know that Gabe is young, and hot and everything. And he’s begging me to reconsider, but I… I just think I’m in love with someone else.",7,21,126
Erin," I wish I knew who my birth mother was, so she could just tell me who to choose.",7,21,126
Erin, [Deangelo enters office in hospital gown with bandage on his head] Deangelo?,7,22,127
Erin, I thought I needed to know for your calendar.,7,23,128
Erin, [on phone] 2:00 should probably be okay. I can either take your number or – [Gabe ends the call],7,23,128
Erin, Dwight doesn’t trust robots to give us our messages. ,7,23,128
Erin," I’m taking a break from dating. Gabe was a great guy with so many wonderful qualities, but it was a challenge being touched by him.   				",7,23,128
Erin,  [commenting on the poster] It’s good. I really hope you get it!,7,24,129
Erin,"  Still, I’d really like to see this office with you in the boss’s chair.",7,24,129
Erin,  [checks to see that she is alone with Phyllis] Did you hear anything?,7,24,129
Erin,"  So, Phyllis might be my mom. I mean, the chances are tiny, but…",7,24,129
Erin,  Yeah. I’m sure I was just another Porky’s baby.,7,24,129
Erin,"  I think Andy should be the boss. He’s just so great. If I’m being objective, then Darryl, of course.  				",7,24,129
Erin,  [trying to cut off Phyllis] I… I don’t think I can do that.,7,24,129
Erin,"  [knocks and enters] Jo, you have one more candidate. He’s a burn victim.",7,24,129
Erin,  [motions toward her face] He’s all messed up. I can tell him to get lost if you want.,7,24,129
Erin,"  [hiding under desk, raises a sock puppet up, talking in high-pitched voice] Ahh!",7,24,129
Erin,  I went to drop off the FedEx forms and an evil witch named Angela turned me into a puppet!,7,24,129
Erin,  And there’s only one thing that can change me back into a real girl.  				,7,24,129
Erin,  [as sock puppet] I need the most special thing in the office.,7,24,129
Erin,  A date with the best salesman… Andy Bernard! [Andy walks over to Erin’s desk],7,24,129
Erin,"  I see it. [nods and smiles] I see it like I see a mountain that I’m standing in front of [voice cracks] and facing, and I’m like…",7,24,129

Darryl," No, we got a truck going out at 1:15. So, that’s the busy time.",1,5,5
Darryl," All right, fine, you know what? One o’clock.",1,5,5
Darryl, Why don’t we make it more interesting? Loser buys dinner at Farley’s.,1,5,5
Darryl," No, that’s not as much fun. You know what?",1,5,5
Darryl, [scores] Here we go. Here we go. Here we go.,1,5,5
Darryl, You have one more free throw shoot. Come on.,1,5,5
Darryl," Well, [points at Michael] those are some awful tight pants you have on. Where’d you get em? Like Queers R Us?",2,2,9
Darryl," Man, we can see all your business coming around the corner, okay? You need to, you know, hide the… good thing you don’t have a lot of business to start with.",2,2,9
Darryl, [fake whispers to Roy] I think he feels bad.,2,2,9
Darryl," Oh, Mi… ! Hey, stop the video! Michael, stop it right there! Stop it right there! That’s that girl from that thing. [pointing at Redheaded Actress] I banged this girl right here. This is… ",2,2,9
Darryl, Yes! [to video screen]  Right here. You are a naughty girl!,2,2,9
Darryl," Come on, Mike, let me borrow the hat for just a couple of hours.",2,10,17
Darryl," Oh, yeah, I need McMahon, Deion Branch to have big games or else I’m done.",2,10,17
Darryl, How about the sales department is the sails?,2,11,18
Darryl, [walking by with new carpet] What… What’s that?  Whatcha doing? ,2,14,21
Darryl, My biggest fear is that someone will distract us from getting all the shipments out on time.,2,15,22
Darryl," Hey, Mike, look. How bout we go upstairs, too. You know learn how the office works. We can all switch places today.",2,15,22
Darryl," It’s dangerous, Michael. Come on, get off this.",2,15,22
Darryl, Mike. Get off of the lift. Please. Come on now.,2,15,22
Darryl, We’re the ones that got to clean that up!,2,15,22
Darryl," So it really bothers me when somebody comes in here speeding around on a lift, playing with it like a toy. It kind of gets under my skin.",2,15,22
Darryl," No, you don’t. You don’t feel us. How can you? You know what?",2,15,22
Darryl," You say we’re the same, but we get compensated very differently.",2,15,22
Darryl, We work the same hours as you and you just said we work a lot harder,2,15,22
Darryl, You know this would not happen if we had a union.,2,15,22
Darryl," Man, see… That’s what I’ve been sayin’, man. We need to do this finally.",2,15,22
Darryl," It’s more than necessary, Mike. We need this. Roy? You still have that card from the Dockworker’s Union?",2,15,22
Darryl," Mike, I am not having fire-eaters in a paper warehouse. ",2,22,29
Darryl, We just have a lot of stuff down there that could be stolen. ,2,22,29
Darryl," I taught Mike some, uh, phrases to help with his interracial conversations. You know, stuff like, “Fleece it out.” “Going mach five.” “Dinkin’ flicka.” You know, things us Negroes say.   				",2,22,29
Darryl," Oh, yeah, I taught him a handshake, too.  				",2,22,29

Darryl," Mike, I’m very busy down here. [eats chicken]  ",3,11,41
Darryl," Oh, yes! Yes! What’d I tell you? I knew he’d turn up [holds up an iPod inside speakers] You see that? This is the greatest night of my life.   ",3,11,41
Darryl," Okay, I’ll start.  It’s pretty simple really. I uh, I think I deserve a raise.  I’m scheduled to get one in six months, but I’d like that to be moved up to now.",3,18,48
Darryl, Are you wearin’ lady clothes?  Those look like lady… pants.,3,18,48
Darryl," Okay, can you just stand right there?  [snaps camera phone picture] I gotta send some e-mails.    				",3,18,48
Darryl," Well, it’s simple Mike. I mean we merged these two branches right?  So now we’re shipping twice as many orders as we used to.  With Roy gone we got a smaller crew.  And I’m pickin’ up all of his slack, so I think I should be compensated fairly, by gettin’ a raise.",3,18,48
Darryl," I am serious, Mike.  That’s a 10% raise.  That’s what I want.",3,18,48
Darryl, [laughs] Are you serious?  You’re earning this?,3,18,48
Darryl," Mike, this is barely more than I make.  You been here ten years, dog. [laughs]",3,18,48
Darryl," Oh, I’m sorry Mike, some of my folks got to hear about this one.  [texting on cell phone] Ah. [laughs] ",3,18,48
Darryl," [on cell phone] Fourteen years.  Fourteen.  I know.  [laughing]  Ok, alright.  I gotta go.  Later.  [hangs up]",3,18,48

Darryl," Get your own raise.  You gotta get out there and earn, son.",3,18,48
Darryl," Well, when they merged the two branches together, they put ",3,18,48

Darryl, I haven’t been to New York in a long time.,3,18,48
Darryl, Maybe I’ll stay overnight.  Got a cousin lives down there.,3,18,48
Darryl, Oh you could stay too.  He’s got a big place.,3,18,48
Darryl," Busses, though.  They get you home quick.",3,18,48
Darryl," Okay, bring it home now.  And don’t forget the new black man phrase I taught you.",3,18,48
Darryl, Yes sir.  Remember that.  I’ll be right outside if you need me,3,18,48
Darryl," Yeah, I taught Mike some new phrases.  I want him to get the raise, I… just can’t help myself.  				",3,18,48
Darryl," Now, this is the forklift.  You need— [Michael rattles it] You need a license to operate this machine.  That means the upstairs office workers ",3,19,49
Darryl," It’s not safe, you don’t have a license.",3,19,49
Darryl,"  Her.  Yes, “her” is qualified to work a dangerous machine.  You are not.  Okay?",3,19,49
Darryl," We do safety training every year, or after an accident. … We’ve never made it a full year.  This particular time, I was reaching for a supply box on the top shelf, when one office worker, who shall remain nameless, kicked the ladder out from under me and yelled…  					",3,19,49
Darryl, And I fell and busted my ankle.  I’m legitimately scared for my workers.  					,3,19,49
Darryl, The baler can flatten a car engine.  It can cut off your arm and crush your entire body without skipping a beat.,3,19,49
Darryl, How many people a year do you think get their arms cut off in a baler?,3,19,49
Darryl," Ten people, Michael. Ten people.  Would you like to be one of them?",3,19,49
Darryl," [in background] You have to be alert, and calm. And always careful…",3,19,49
Darryl," These are very dangerous machines down here, and the upstairs workers, ",3,19,49
Darryl, It’s not a trash compactor!  It’s a baler!,3,19,49
Darryl," There is no occasion for you to go near this stuff, okay?  					",3,19,49
Darryl, Thank God we only had a baler to deal with.,3,19,49
Darryl," That’s what I’ve been trying to tell you, Mike.  It’s serious down there.  We do dangerous stuff, man.  This is shenanigans, foolishness, Nerf-ball.  You live a sweet, little, Nerf-y life.  Sittin’ on your biscuit.  Never havin’ to risk it.",3,19,49
Darryl," Mike, this is the opposite of safety.  You jump, you’re gonna serious hurt yourself.",3,19,49
Darryl," Yeah, but I never said you had nothing to live for.",3,19,49
Darryl," A lot… of things.  Uh, you, uh… What about Jan?  Lovely, lovely, lovely Jan, man.  It’s goin’ good, right?",3,19,49
Darryl," Mike, you’re a very brave man.  I mean, it takes courage just to ",3,19,49
Darryl, I couldn’t do it. I— I ain’t that strong.  And I ain’t that brave.,3,19,49
Darryl, [feeding a squirrel] I’m giving him a peanut.,4,1,55
Darryl, Hey!  How about instead of yelling at our sweet little Miss Kapoor over five hundred sheets of paper you get back to your desk.  Start sellin’ multiple reams like a man.,4,3,57
Darryl," There’s information here? Yeah, you’re right, I don’t need this. ",4,4,58
Darryl, I have my daughter tonight; we’re renting Charlotte’s Web.,4,4,58
Darryl, It’s like she only wants to hook up when Ryan comes around.  It’s gotten to the point where I get excited every time I see that little dude walk through the door.  ,4,4,58
Darryl," Hey, I like you.  Oh yeah, what’s not to like?  But you need to access your uncrazy side, otherwise maybe this thing’s run its course.",4,4,58
Darryl," [singing] Out of paper, out of stock, there’s friendly faces around the block, break loose from the chains that are causing your pain.",4,5,59
Darryl," [singing in different tune] Out of paper, out of stock, there’s friendly faces around the block, break loose from the chains that are causing your pain. Call Michael, Stanley, Jim, Dwight or Creed. Call Andy and Kelly for your business paper needs. Call Dunder Mifflin.",4,5,59

Darryl,  Two thousand one hundred seventy-five. [everyone moans] Sorry guys.,5,1,63
Darryl, Hell yeah.  You know why?  Because that was my baby.,5,3,65
Darryl, You should stop calling yourself “baby daddy.”,5,3,65
Darryl," Because you’re not a daddy, and it’s not your baby.",5,3,65
Darryl, You feel connected to his baby over there?,5,3,65
Darryl, You feel connected to this? [hold up his back brace],5,3,65
Darryl," You want to hold me, to see how you feel?",5,3,65
Darryl," Mike gave me a list of his top ten Springsteen songs. Three of them were Huey Lewis and the News. One was Tracy Chapman, Fast Car. And my personal favorite, Short People.  				",5,4,66
Darryl," Mike, you can’t do that. It’s conflict of interest.",5,4,66
Darryl," [leaving someone a message on his cell phone, looking very uncomfortable] Hey what’s up, I just thought I’d try you. I was thinking about that story where you ran into the girl you used to babysit. ",5,5,67
Darryl," [Michael and Holly cautiously pass each other] There’s another dolly in the truck, Mike. You could take more than that lamp.  				",5,5,67
Darryl, But you want me to put it back in the truck.,5,5,67
Darryl," Looked like it. Sometimes when I’m down like this, it helps to sing the blues.",5,5,67
Darryl, [bluesy] Da na na na na…  da na na na  na…,5,5,67
Darryl," Da  na na na na.  No, no, check it out, look. Da  na na na na… want to do that?",5,5,67

Darryl," No, wait. You’re, you’re supposed to… Never mind. Da  na na na na.",5,5,67
Darryl," I was there. That dude is not engaged. I’m not a big believer in therapy, but I’ll go into my own pocket to cover his co-pay.  ",5,6,68
Darryl," All right man, don’t cry.  It’s cool.  I’ll let you get it for $400.",5,10,72
Darryl," Mike claims, we’re all a family isn’t that right?",5,13,75
Darryl," Ok, so um, what’s his name? All the way in the back there.",5,13,75
Darryl, Nope. His name is Michael. [Michael makes the da dum ksch on the drumset again]  				,5,13,75
Darryl, I put three pallets on the truck to Blue Cross once a week. They use a lot of paper. ,5,17,79
Darryl,"   I was rushing to fill an order.  I put the ladder up to grab a box of three hole from the top shelf.  Next thing I know, I’m on the ground and the ladder’s on top of me.  ",6,2,82
Darryl,"   This doesn’t concern you man, you need to walk away.",6,2,82
Darryl,"   If we were living in Sweden, I wouldn’t have to worry about this ’cause we’d have universal healthcare.  ",6,2,82
Darryl,"   Thanks T-Man, later.  [fist bumps Toby}",6,2,82
Darryl,"   You come to my house, bust up my trash cans, call my baby sister an ass****, and told her to eat dog food.  ",6,2,82
Darryl,"   Here’s what I’m gonna do, I’m calling corporate and I’m filing a complaint against both of you.  ",6,2,82
Darryl,   And I’m telling them you guys sexually harassed my sister.  ,6,2,82
Darryl," This is the spookiest warehouse in the world, kids. You don’t believe me? Just take a look. [Kevin chops into Erin, who is dressed as Princess Fiona] Oh. Scary, huh? This is a surgery with an octopus and a burn victim.",6,7,87
Darryl," Nobody told me what people were, alright? So…  label yourselves or take what you get.",6,7,87
Darryl, Here is an old man and a goth dude… and then the old crone from Drag Me to Hell.,6,7,87
Darryl," I asked for a list. [Dwight rides in on a tricycle, laughing diabolically] …and a clown.",6,7,87
Darryl," You’re not as scary as Book Face, over there.",6,7,87
Darryl," Ok, kids. You’ve all been so good and unbelievably patient so I think you are gonna get some candy!",6,7,87
Darryl, Didn’t have to see. It was sales. I can feel it. They are out of control. ,6,18,98
Darryl," Yes. All of ’em. Together. It’s a conspiracy. Listen to me, Mike, you gotta do something about them. ",6,18,98
Darryl," That sounds fun, mucking around in the dump. Wish I could go.",6,18,98
Darryl,"Look, just be straight with me, man. You can be gay with Matt, just be straight with me. ",6,19,99
Darryl,"So, the guy shows me the deck he’s built. And I’m like, ‘I’ll call this a deck if it’ll make you happy, but this is just a porch without a roof.’ [laughter, Oscar looks toward door] It was ridiculous man, it was like-you could maybe get two chairs on the thing. Two lawn chairs.  				",6,19,99
Darryl,"Hey, man, you put together a pretty fun night for everybody. I saw you talking to Hide. Did you hear that dude’s life story? It’s amazing, right?",6,19,99
Darryl,"Let me tell you something, Oscar. All right, Matt’s an okay dude, but he’s a dummy. You guys got nothing in common.",6,19,99
Darryl, I brought those in. It’s my birthday.  That’s some stone-cold narcissism right there.,6,20,100
Darryl, Thank you. [Kevin grabs cookie and starts eating it],6,20,100
Darryl," [as Cookie Monster] Yum, Yum, Yum, Yum, Yum, Yum.  				",6,20,100
Darryl, I like the sound of this. [looks at Dwight] Maybe one day I’ll be sitting in Michael’s chair. Wouldn’t that be something?  				,6,21,101
Darryl," I got my whole life to be a minority executive. I only have about a year left in these knees, though.   				",6,21,101
Darryl, [puts newspaper down] Wow. That dude is good.,6,22,102
Darryl, You didn’t feel like he was hiding something?,6,22,102
Darryl, Like he was… covering something up? Maybe.  				,6,22,102
Darryl," Two years ago, Andy blamed the warehouse for a late shipment that he forgot to process. We got yelled at pretty bad. Almost lost my job, and I was mad as hell at the time. But I said “Darryl, just wait. He’s a fool. There’s gonna be an opportunity. Just be patient.” [smiles]  				",6,22,102
Darryl, I don’t have a plan exactly. More of a loose structure. Gives me freedom to improvise. It’s like jazz. [scatting] Andy don’t mess with me. [continues scatting] I’ll figure something out.  				,6,22,102
Darryl, Some freaky stuff going on. I was walking behind Gabe and I heard some things.,6,22,102
Darryl," It was kind of mumbled, I don’t know, uh, only thing I could make out clearly was “Andy,” “Problem,” “Eliminate,” something. I don’t know what it meant.",6,22,102
Darryl," Look, I’m not down there anymore, so if the guys start making fun of you, you just, you gotta stand up for yourself. ",6,22,102
Darryl," Glen, could you excuse us? [Andy slams the door after Glen leaves, panting heavily] ",6,22,102
Darryl, You should talk in a higher voice ’cause the camera makes you sound weird. ,6,22,102
Darryl, Higher. [motions with hand to go up more],6,22,102
Darryl," One more, yeah. [Again motions to go even higher]",6,22,102
Darryl," I don’t wanna prank anymore. Things get real. It’s not funny. I’m just gonna be good, stay in my room, go to church, try to do one nice thing per day. I do not wanna prank anymore.  				",6,22,102
Darryl,"  Probably shouldn’t tell you this, but a lotta guys in the warehouse work multiple jobs, so… we have a place.",6,23,103
Darryl,  A restful location. Talk to Glen. He’ll take you up in the lift.,6,23,103
Darryl,"  Lightbulb’s burnt out, so it’s dark. And the heat from the backup generator keeps it nice and warm. Sometimes I think about it when I’m trying to fall asleep at home. But as far as the rest of the office goes, it doesn’t exist, okay?",6,23,103
Darryl," Yeah, I did. I, I was talking to this girl at a bar.",6,24,104
Darryl," I think she could… sense my sadness, and I, and I found out too late that she… she’s the copy editor at the Trib.",6,24,104
Darryl," Michael, you know you don’t have to turn us all in. All you need is one scapegoat.",6,24,104
Darryl," My summer, I, um, blew out my knee playing softball. Ended up watching CNN most of the time. I don’t know how we’re going to get out of Afghanistan. I hate the new assistant. He’s only been here for a week, and I hate him.   				",7,1,106
Darryl, What’s wrong with a level playing field?,7,1,106
Darryl,"  Say stuff like, “Good morning, Good Afternoon”. People appreciate that. ",7,2,107
Darryl,  I saw a TLC show on Kate Walsh’s home office. All corkboard.,7,2,107
Darryl," Hey, I think this guy playing Sweeney Todd is my plumber. ",7,3,108
Darryl," No, it’s my plumber. Says so in his bio. Apparently the director discovered him doing karaoke. It’s his first play. He didn’t even audition.",7,3,108
Darryl," Shhh. If we don’t listen to the overture, we won’t recognize the musical themes when they come back later.",7,3,108
Darryl," I’m sure they don’t regret having their child, let’s move it to the pros.",7,4,109
Darryl, Ohh. Ok. I didn’t realize we were doing trick questions. What’s the safest way to go skiing? Don’t ski! [office laughs],7,4,109
Darryl," [Andy walks in Darryl’s office] We should schedule meetings, because the days can slip away with chit-chat. Are you crying?",7,4,109
Darryl, I don’t know who’s got you upset but my advice is stop crying.,7,4,109
Darryl," Look you need to pick yourself up. Man up, alright? You will win this in the end. It’s all about heart, and character. Be your best self.",7,4,109
Darryl," I have no idea what his problem is, that’s just my standard advice. It’s good advice right?  				",7,4,109
Darryl, I’m very busy with time-sensitive work.,7,5,110
Darryl," If you don’t enter them immediately, you forget. What?",7,5,110
Darryl," One second, one second, one second. [stops playing] So, this song is from the point of view of a little girl?",7,5,110
Darryl," No, that’s not a good idea. I don’t see that as a very good song.",7,5,110
Darryl, What’s something you really care about?,7,5,110
Darryl, [plays soft chords and sings]  Couldn’t get outta bed today. Wish the alarm clock would go away.,7,5,110
Darryl, Yes. I do remember saying something like that to you. ,7,6,111
Darryl," Let me put my shoes on. [hangs up phone, dial tone]",7,6,111
Darryl," Well, I’m sorry if it seems that way to you.",7,6,111
Darryl, You made a bad call. And I fixed it. So I’m not apologizing.,7,6,111
Darryl, You’re gonna be missing out on some good ideas.,7,6,111
Darryl, Ed Truck hired me. Jo promoted me. Gabe listened to me. All you’ve ever done is say no to me. I have ambition. And you kept me at the same level for years.,7,6,111
Darryl," Sometimes it seems like it was better down in the warehouse, you know?",7,6,111
Darryl, No. I got some work to do. I do got big plans with this company.  				,7,6,111
Darryl, We are hanging out-right now. You want some more of this?,7,7,112
Darryl, You need to change your standard for what’s worthy of a text. Ask yourself is this something Darryl needs to know. The answers almost always no.,7,10,115
Darryl," There was a time when the only people who texted you were people you wanted to text you. Girls. And they’d all say the same thing. “I’m coming over baby.” And I would text back “BTB”, bring that booty.  				",7,10,115
Darryl, [reads text] “Are you watching this?” Seriously?,7,10,115
Darryl, [reading text] Megan Fox. Question mark. What’s that mean?,7,10,115
Darryl," You know what, you’re one bad text away from getting blocked.",7,10,115
Darryl, [reads text] Come to parking lot. Crazy pigeon action?  				,7,10,115
Darryl, [laughs] That’s a text. [high fives Andy],7,10,115
Darryl, I’ll take one of those pink pouches.  				,7,11,116
Darryl," I feel good today. My little girl Jada? It’s my turn to have her for Christmas this year. Two years ago I had her, and we had the best time. I tivoed her favorite shows, some things I’ve never heard of. iCarly… You know who’s funny on that show? The friend with the video camera. He’s got a nice way of talking.  				",7,11,116
Darryl," Come on, now, Justine, look… Listen, look, I’ve been planning this, okay? You cannot do this, Justine. ",7,11,116
Darryl, I don’t know… I thought I was enough family for my daughter.  				,7,11,116
Darryl," [Pam knocks on Darryl’s door] Don’t come in, I’m busy. [Pam opens the door]",7,11,116
Darryl, No. Thank you for your interest in my truck.,7,11,116
Darryl," Hey… [sighs] You know what, I could use a breath of fresh air. Let’s do it.  				",7,11,116
Darryl," [on the phone] I just, no, she be talking to your mom or something. This is my daughter too, Justine! You seem to think, [Justine hangs up] oh… pick a damn tree already.",7,11,116
Darryl," Jada don’t want to spend Christmas with me. She told her mom it wasn’t as much fun. And how could she say that? You know, I took her to the toy store to buy her own presents.",7,11,116
Darryl, Her mom wants me to take her to mass. I guess that’s something to do.,7,11,116
Darryl," No, he doesn’t. [to Michael] I told her Santa would be here.",7,11,116
Darryl," Ohh, that sounds fun and Christmasy, you mean old grinch!",7,11,116
Darryl," Maybe the grinch hid the Christmas star, and we could ask for clues, and he’ll tell us if we’re hot or cold.",7,11,116
Darryl, And the game’s over seconds later.  				,7,11,116
Darryl," What do you want, baby? We got some granola, got some cupcakes, chips, apples, pies… ",7,11,116
Darryl," You know what you guys should do? Go to the bookstore at lunch. There’s tons of cuties and it’s easy to talk to them. ‘Hey, what book is that? Cool, let’s hang out tonight. Sex already? Whoa…’ ",7,12,117
Darryl," I’ll come with you, show you how it’s done.",7,12,117
Darryl," My resolution is to read more. And if someone else is driving me to the bookstore, I can eat my PB&J in the car. 2011 is coming up all Darryl.  				",7,12,117
Darryl, I got that cutie behind the counter.  				,7,12,117
Darryl," Whoa, I work at a paper company, those things terrify me. They could put us out of business, you know? I heard those machines hold like, ten books at once.",7,12,117
Darryl," Holy [bleep], what? Let me see that. It’s so light. Like a croissant.  				",7,12,117
Darryl," No, that’s uh. Porn. Pornography. Old lady… nasty… porn.  				",7,12,117
Darryl," [Dwight heads toward a strip club] Oh, no, no, no. Uh-uh. ",7,12,117
Darryl," I’m telling you, don’t do it. I’ve got nothing against strip clubs, but I do have something against them at noon on a Monday. The day shift at a strip club? You can’t unsee that.",7,12,117
Darryl, What kind of chicks are you going to meet there?,7,12,117
Darryl, [whispering] They’re a bunch of jackals. ,7,13,118
Darryl," They left you in the lurch, and if they want to jump in, it means you’re almost there. You did this. Bring it home. ",7,13,118
Darryl, I’ve been reading the comics to my daughter since she was three years old. Not once I have used the real captions to Family Circus. That crazy family is hilarious to her for one reason:,7,14,119
Darryl," Gabe, tell us your stupid rules so we can start the game. ",7,14,119
Darryl," You crushed our spirits, Gabe. Congrats. You’re a big man, huh? Take a lot to destroy the creativity of a whole group of people. [notification tone] [laughter]",7,14,119
Darryl," Thank you. “Congratulations, Darryl. Let’s get wasted.” “Have fun today, big guy.” “Aww, yeah. Party time. Whoo-whoop.”",7,15,120
Darryl, “Hooray. Live it up big D. ” “Days like this don’t come often enough. Time to celebrate. You deserve this”? ,7,15,120

Darryl," Well, shall we make it a little interesting?",7,18,123
Darryl, And I’m gonna play this here share the wealth card.,7,18,123
Darryl, Which entitles me to half of both of y’alls money so if you don’t mind.,7,18,123
Darryl," I told you we’re way past rules. We have been for some time now. We start having rules now, everything we built collapses.",7,18,123
Darryl, It’s cool that you like the southwest. It’s one of my favorite regions.  				,7,19,124
Darryl," It’s one of my favorite regions? Did I just sound totally lame? No, I sounded good.  				",7,19,124
Darryl, I love the desert. It’s one of my favorite ecosystems. ,7,19,124
Darryl," Finish the joke, Andy. What do African Americans call?",7,19,124
Darryl," Mike, why do you have to control how he perceives it in his mind?",7,20,125
Darryl, [starts playing the tune to Seasons of Love while Andy sits down],7,20,125
Darryl," That’s sweet Mike. Let’s see here. There’s a chapter, called Gum. With one sentence. Everybody likes the guy who offers him a stick of gum.",7,21,126

Darryl," I was talking like this. [mouths words while pointing to his ear] I don’t feel good about it, but he just kept calling himself a gunshot victim and it got to me.   				",7,23,128
Darryl,"  I have a solid relationship with Jo, the company’s owner. I have management experience. I have a good friendship with Jim, the head of the Search Committee, and it doesn’t hurt that I’m… [in Oprah-like sing-song voice] bla-aaack!  				",7,24,129
Darryl,  [pats Andy on the back] Thank you.  				,7,24,129

Darryl,  So this is cool. I think we make a good fit. [stands up],7,24,129
Darryl,  Uh… [looks at camera] yes?! I was. [sits back down] Little joke!,7,24,129
Darryl,"  I’ll answer that, Jim. I would use it as an opportunity to teach, uh, about actions… and consequences… of actions. [Jim and Gabe stare at Darryl]",7,24,129
Darryl,  [noticing Erin in the background leading a black man dressed in a suit through the office] Who’s that?,7,24,129
Darryl,"  Let me… [Jim shows him the resume again, Darryl looks at it a little longer this time] Oh. Cool. [Jim gives Darryl a thumbs-up, then looks at the camera as Darryl gets up to leave]  				",7,24,129

Darryl,"  So, uh… here you go. [gives resume to Jim]",7,24,129

Darryl,"  Okay, shush it. This was a mistake. Let’s go. [Darryl and Jada leave, Ryan slowly shakes his head]",7,24,129
Darryl,"  Every day I have a blueberry muffin. Today, I did not have a blueberry muffin. Should have had the blueberry muffin… especially considering how incredibly superstitious I am.  				",7,24,129

Phyllis, You can pay me back later for the makeover.   				,3,12,42
Phyllis, Dwight has a big personality and I have a big personality. And a lot of times when two people like that get together it can be explosive.  ,3,13,43
Phyllis," Yes, I put Michael in my wedding. It was the only way I could think to get six weeks off for my honeymoon. No one else has ever gotten six weeks before.  					",3,15,45

Phyllis," I couldn’t see your hands. [Jim shakes his hands] Hey Pam, by the way, it’s great that you’re dating. But when a new client calls, you just have to randomly assign them to a sales person. You can’t base who gets new clients on who you’re sleeping with that week, OK?",4,2,56

Phyllis,"  I’m so sorry to hear that, that must be awful.",4,3,57
Phyllis,  I want to understand what you’re saying but it’s difficult for me when you use that tone.,4,3,57
Phyllis, You can pick one of these things.  It’s unreasonable for you to ask me to do all of this.,4,3,57
Phyllis, [Balls up post-its and throws them in Angela’s face],4,3,57
Phyllis, [gasps] Sue Grafton is at the Steamtown Mall. She’s doing a book signing right now.,4,5,59
Phyllis," [crying] Well, I got in line to buy Sue Grafton’s book and when it came to my turn I asked if she wanted to be in the ad and she said no thank you, but I wasn’t supposed to take no for an answer.",4,5,59
Phyllis, So I kept on asking and they finally threw me out of the store in front of all my friends. ,4,5,59
Phyllis, Someone needs to clean it.  It smells like popcorn.  				,4,6,60
Phyllis, Bob and I took rock climbing lessons once. [Michael laughs]  				,4,7,61
Phyllis," Michael wasn’t invited on Ryan’s camping trip. Toby went, but Michael didn’t go. He wasn’t invited.   				",4,7,61
Phyllis," [raises hand] Hey, Michael. I mean Jim.  				",4,7,61
Phyllis,"  Angela, you’ll go to the supermarket and get the New York cheesecake. Make sure it’s the generic one. It’s Stanley’s favorite.  				",5,1,63
Phyllis,"  Yes, I’ve replaced Angela as head of the party planning committee. [footage of Dwight and Angela making out] I guess I was just in the right place at the right time.  				",5,1,63
Phyllis,  We lost weight today. I think it’s OK to reward ourselves once in a while.,5,1,63
Phyllis,"  Stanley, Michael’s not here. You can eat a slice of your birthday cake.",5,1,63
Phyllis,"  [storms in the office, sweaty and out of breath] Are you insane?!",5,1,63
Phyllis,  There was no client.  Dwight drove me to an abandoned warehouse five miles away and pushed me out of the car.  I had to walk home with no money and no phone.,5,1,63
Phyllis,  [into phone] Phyllis Vance for David Wallace.  				,5,1,63
Phyllis,  I wonder what people like about me? … Probably my jugs.  				,5,1,63
Phyllis,  I thought very strongly agree sounded stronger than totally agree.,5,2,64
Phyllis," Thank you, Meredith, this was delicious.",5,2,64
Phyllis, I don’t care what she’s doing.  I just hope she keeps doing it.,5,2,64
Phyllis," Hey, I’m collecting for the baby shower.",5,3,65
Phyllis," Look at it as if you’re paying for the cake, not the baby.  Sheet cake.  				",5,3,65
Phyllis," I do enjoy being the head of the Party Planning Committee.  I’m no longer under Angela’s heel, and her little grape head is under mine.",5,3,65
Phyllis, You know I know. [looks at the camera guys] You know they know.,5,4,66
Phyllis, Angela’s not really a risk taker. And Andy’s not really a risk.,5,4,66
Phyllis," Then you need to give her an ultimatum. Tell her she needs to make a choice. You or Andy. If she pick you, great. If not, you can move on.",5,4,66
Phyllis, It did when Bob said I had to stop talking to my sister on the phone so much.,5,4,66
Phyllis, We could auction off things we do for each other like cleaning or tennis lessons. My sorority did it all the time.,5,4,66
Phyllis, Why couldn’t have you just said it? Why did you actually do it?,5,4,66
Phyllis," Well Dwight, I don’t think you do. I think you’ve got your answer.",5,4,66
Phyllis," Well, I just think we all deserve to be with someone who wants to be with us.",5,4,66
Phyllis, Mm. I like your shoes. [Kelly has 5-inch heels on],5,5,67
Phyllis," Jim, don’t listen to Andy.  I think it’s so romantic.",5,8,70
Phyllis,  I’m sorry.  It’s the largest one I have.,5,10,72
Phyllis," This is the first Christmas party I am throwing as head of the party planning committee.  The theme is “Nights in Morocco”.  This isn’t your grandmothers Christmas party.  Unless of course she’s from Morocco, in which case it’s very accurate.  				",5,10,72
Phyllis, Angela. You’re going to move this for the party right? It’s not on theme.,5,10,72
Phyllis,"  Alright. You can keep your camel, sheep, elephant and the north African king can stay.  Everything else goes in the drawer.  				",5,10,72
Phyllis," Oh, I don’t think it’s blackmail.  Angela just does what I ask her to do so I won’t tell everyone that she’s cheating on Andy with Dwight.  I think for it to be black mail, it would have to be a formal letter.  				",5,10,72
Phyllis," It looks like we’re going to be here for awhile, so why don’t you make a little plate of hummus for everyone.  Little triangles of pita, toasted on both sides, fanned so you can easily can grab them.",5,10,72
Phyllis, I was waiting until later to hand out this years gifts from corporate. [holds up shot glass] I don’t think they’re appropriate anymore.  				,5,10,72
Phyllis, You never showed me mercy when you were in charge.  Why aren’t you wearing the hairnet?,5,10,72
Phyllis, That’s a halwa shabkia cookie.  They serve it during Ramadan. [Angela spits her cookie out],5,10,72
Phyllis, I need you to put the Christmas tree back up.,5,10,72
Phyllis, I didn’t ask you where it was.  I told you where it needs to be.,5,10,72
Phyllis," Okay. [starts to walk away, then turns around] Angela’s having sex with Dwight.  I caught them doing it after Toby’s going away party.",5,10,72
Phyllis, Andy’s running over Dwight with his car.  				,5,11,73
Phyllis, It is a big deal. You almost killed Stanley.,5,13,75
Phyllis," Oh, ok. [Phyllis signs for the package, opens an empty box]",5,13,75
Phyllis," You forgot her birthday, it was yesterday.  				",5,14,76
Phyllis," Hey, why don’t you guys come have lunch with Bob and me?  We’ll take all afternoon. [whispering] Michael is terrified of bob.",5,16,78
Phyllis, It is so nice to go out with another couple.,5,16,78
Phyllis," He’s talking about Michael, Dwight, and Andy. ",5,16,78
Phyllis, Okay. Now everyone here who’s bowled under 70 raise their hand.,5,16,78
Phyllis," Come on, Bob.  Raise your hand. [Bob does so reluctantly]",5,16,78
Phyllis," Oh sure, a little piece.  Ooh, no mushroom though.",5,16,78
Phyllis," Yeah, thank you. [As Phyllis enjoys Bob’s meat, Jim and Pam look knowingly into the camera]  				",5,16,78
Phyllis, They’re not getting married. It’s just talk.,6,1,81
Phyllis," There’s nothing to know, it’s just gossip.",6,1,81
Phyllis," Teri, Stanley’s wife. She’s at an interior decorating expo in Philly. Stanley hates crowds, kids, and music. I think you should check your facts.",6,1,81
Phyllis," Hey, did you guys register for wedding gifts?",6,3,83
Phyllis," My cousin makes the most amazing romantic birdhouse mailboxes. I know I shouldn’t tell you, but you’ll still be suprised when you see it. You’re not registered for a birdhouse, are you?",6,3,83
Phyllis," This isn’t a game, you know? It’s our livelihood!  				",6,3,83
Phyllis, It’s not so much that I might not get a raise. It’s just demeaning!,6,3,83
Phyllis," [at Michael return to Jim’s office] Michael, you cannot just keep avoiding us like this!",6,3,83
Phyllis,  That’s funny.  Your wife loved this hat the last time she saw it. [glares at Stanley’s date]  				,6,4,84
Phyllis,  I think Pam ran away because she knew deep down  she wouldn’t be a good wife.  ,6,4,84
Phyllis,"  Good luck Michael, I hope you find what you’re looking for.",6,6,86
Phyllis," Michael, did you you fall into a Koi pond?",6,7,87
Phyllis," And when you fell in, did you flounder?",6,7,87
Phyllis," So now you’re comparing yourself to a cute, tiny animal?",6,7,87
Phyllis," Michael. You know, when you think about it, it’s not all your fault. I mean, who puts a Koi pond in a lobby?",6,7,87
Phyllis,  “It is rumored that they will recommend declaring bankruptcy.”,6,9,89
Phyllis,"  You know, I think I’m supposed to say something to Pam, I mean, Deb, OK?  [in character] I overheard you asking the butler where the pistol was kept.",6,9,89
Phyllis, Bob took me to Capello’s. We got a little tipsy.,6,10,90
Phyllis," Oh, it’s ok. Michael doesn’t really care about these things.",6,10,90
Phyllis, It’s not like you can fire people or anything.,6,10,90
Phyllis," Yeah, but in your perfect world, only you get money.  				",6,11,91
Phyllis," How is that possible?  No offense Pam, but how the hell is that possible?",6,11,91
Phyllis," Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas boys and girls! It’s me, Santa Claus!",6,12,92
Phyllis," I have been wanting to be Santa for years. I believe I have the right temperament, and the figure to do the job well. I slipped a note to Jim eleven weeks ago, and he said I could do it. [she awkwardly hugs Jim] It’s been a long journey… but [sniffles] I’m Santa Claus!  ",6,12,92
Phyllis, It’s going to be a very jolly time if you’ve been good!,6,12,92
Phyllis, Oh then nothing but a lump of coal for you!,6,12,92
Phyllis, You promised me this. Don’t make me get Bob involved!,6,12,92
Phyllis," Never mind, I shouldn’t have said that.  ",6,12,92
Phyllis," In the North Pole I spend many nights alone tinkering with toys. So today, let’s put a twinkle in Ole Kris Kringle’s eye! Let the party begin! [Dwight plugs in tree lights, office applauds.]  ",6,12,92
Phyllis," All right sweetie, I’ll tell her its Michael.",6,12,92
Phyllis, This just arrived from the Dunder Mifflin North Pole branch!,6,12,92
Phyllis, Ho ho ho! For Stanley! Ho ho ho! You’ve been very good this year –,6,12,92
Phyllis, Hi Michael. [Michael sits on her lap] Mm. ‘kay.,6,12,92
Phyllis, An Xbox it is. Because I’ve decided you’re a good boy.,6,12,92
Phyllis, I’m really sorry. It was earlier today.,6,12,92
Phyllis," I’m good baby. [they kiss, both dressed as Santa]",6,12,92
Phyllis," Michael, this isn’t a toast. You’re just thinking out loud. ",6,14,94
Phyllis, I sent an email out to everyone in this area that this might be a side effect to my new allergy medication I’m on.,6,15,95
Phyllis,  I can put on lipstick the way Molly Ringwald does in The Breakfast Club.,6,16,96
Phyllis,  This is ridiculous.  We just can’t wait here.,6,16,96
Phyllis,"  But you don’t know that.  I mean, we could be here another half an hour.",6,16,96
Phyllis, But is there anything relevant to the sales staff here?,6,18,98
Phyllis," Honey, if I don’t have time to answer an e-mail, I definitely don’t have time to walk over to your desk.   				",6,18,98
Phyllis," Finally, Michael. Hand ’em over, numbnuts. [Michael stares at her incredulously] But seriously. It’s your job to give us those leads. ",6,18,98
Phyllis, What the hell do you think you’re doing?,6,18,98
Phyllis, Are you gonna give me the leads or not?,6,18,98
Phyllis," Michael, why would we all go to the dump?",6,18,98
Phyllis," I don’t know about this. I mean, I think we should hold our ground. The company’s changed, and if they don’t like it, they can leave. I mean, a lot of their work can be done from India. ",6,18,98
Phyllis, What’s the least we can do to make this okay?,6,18,98
Phyllis, I guess we could give them some of our new commissions.,6,18,98
Phyllis," Oh, if they don’t have an iPod by now they really don’t want one.",6,18,98
Phyllis," So how about, guys, one percent commission a month instead of two, what do you – ",6,18,98
Phyllis," Yeah, we wanted to do the right thing. So…  [Jim gestures for her to continue]",6,18,98
Phyllis," Our treats, Stanley, they’ve accepted our simple offer of treats. Nothing more. ",6,18,98
Phyllis, Yuck. I’m not going to sit on that disgusting seat.,6,18,98
Phyllis,"One more, one more! [cheers and applause]",6,19,99
Phyllis,"Hmmm, I saw a new drink on TV I’d like to try. I’ll ask Bob.  				",6,19,99
Phyllis,"Yeah, I love going to bars with Bob. I tend to wear something low-cut, get men to flirt with me, and Bob beats ’em up. What?  				",6,19,99
Phyllis, You don’t know that. Some people can’t help oozing sexuality. ,6,21,101
Phyllis, She just crossed her arms together… that’s bad.,6,21,101
Phyllis," Michael, you know, it’s easy to get fooled. Bob’s warehouse guys flirt with me all the time. It… it’s mostly harmless. Usually I don’t let it go too far.",6,21,101
Phyllis,  For your signature. [drops document on Michael’s desk],6,23,103
Phyllis," [quietly, to Andy] Put your hand up, Norma Rae. ",6,24,104
Phyllis," Look, he’s been complaining about this for a while, it’s not crazy.   				",6,24,104
Phyllis," I don’t know, is it Shadow or Garth, it’s something weird, I…",6,24,104
Phyllis, [points to the ceiling] You deserve it.  				,6,24,104
Phyllis, Dwight! [Dwight pulls out a hunting knife and jumps off desk],7,1,106
Phyllis, Did you send those samples to Justin at Lehigh Motors yesterday? Because he didn’t get ’em.,7,1,106
Phyllis," Yeah, but it’s like you’re saying we should bother Luke. ",7,1,106
Phyllis," Hey, why can’t we bother Luke? He deserves it.",7,1,106
Phyllis," Well, take a look. It’s all the packages he was supposed to overnight. He never bothered to send them.",7,1,106
Phyllis," Yep, I just lost a client cause I swore I sent these samples on time.",7,1,106
Phyllis,  The mall itself or just the stores in the mall? ,7,2,107
Phyllis,"  I’m glad Michael is getting help. He as a lot of issues, and he’s stupid.   				",7,2,107
Phyllis," Oh, come on, Andy, you were the highlight.",7,3,108
Phyllis, [seeing a large red spot on Michael’s lip] God! Wow!,7,4,109
Phyllis," Oh! When you got your new phone, that’s when you asked for everyone’s attention.",7,4,109
Phyllis, The ability to express love physically. It’s a magical thing.,7,4,109
Phyllis," You know, I forget about milk. This is a terrific reminder.  				",7,5,110
Phyllis, It’s not gonna get better; he’s gonna steal all of our clients.,7,5,110
Phyllis," Michael, what am I supposed to tell my clients if they ask about you?",7,7,112
Phyllis," Okay, but what about the bigger corporate accounts?",7,7,112
Phyllis, I know. I thought you two were nice together.,7,8,113
Phyllis," Erin! Uhm, so how long have you two been going out now?",7,8,113
Phyllis, And I imagine things are starting to heat up?,7,8,113
Phyllis," Of course you don’t wanna rush things! I mean the anticipation can be so exquisite. Bob and I took our time. The first time we saw each other naked we didn’t even make love, we just stared at each other until we fell asleep. It was magical.",7,8,113
Phyllis, You have all of our attention just by screaming anything. ,7,9,114
Phyllis," Yeah, Dwight’s right we should drop a bomb.",7,10,115
Phyllis, Well I like being in the same building as Bob. Keeps me honest.,7,10,115
Phyllis," Nobody cares about that. Look, you have to make him commit, or kick his butt to the curb.",7,11,116
Phyllis," Yeah. Money problems, is that what this is about? I mean, oh, dear, I don’t think we can help you out.",7,11,116
Phyllis," Well, I don’t think Erin seems to like you.",7,11,116
Phyllis," I know Sue. She’s not that great. And you know her husband’s in a wheelchair, right?   				",7,12,117
Phyllis," [whispering] Follow my lead. Hey, want some company?",7,12,117
Phyllis," So, I’ve just gotta know. What’s going on with you and AJ?",7,12,117
Phyllis," You didn’t break up with AJ at all? I mean, not even for a week to make him buy you a present?",7,12,117
Phyllis," Well, if you think it’s so easy, Gabe, why don’t you try it?",7,14,119
Phyllis, Maybe that’s not the best one. Keep reading. ,7,14,119
Phyllis," No, that’s not the one I was thinking of. Keep going.",7,14,119
Phyllis," Blue Wasabi is so good, but get the cheeseburger. They say they won’t do it, but they will if you make a scene. ",7,15,120
Phyllis," Yeah, and it’s not just the kissing. It’s the flirtatious whispering. ",7,15,120
Phyllis," If you’re just handing them out, I want one too.",7,17,122
Phyllis, It didn’t go down so easy but she’s made some friends and it’s already better than it was.,7,18,123
Phyllis, Uh I don’t know if you ever know. And if you wait for the day when your parent to comes to you and says ‘I cant take care of myself anymore’ its never gonna happen. I have a box of bras under the table if you’re interested.,7,18,123
Phyllis, I have diabetes too. You don’t see me making a big deal about it.  				,7,20,125
Phyllis," [in the conference room with Pam, Angela, and Meredith] How about cupcakes?",7,21,126
Phyllis, The three of us have all been chairmen before.,7,21,126
Phyllis, I thought he knew about the baby I gave away.  				,7,21,126
Phyllis," [holds up mittens she’s knitting] Look Michael, it’s a going away present so your hands won’t get cold.",7,21,126
Phyllis," It’s almost done, but you can’t get them wet, and they can’t be dry-cleaned either. You have to hand wash without water, wring-dry gently, and use a hairdryer on cool.",7,21,126
Phyllis, [to Dwight] Do you believe that?!  				,7,21,126
Phyllis," Hmm, let’s hear here out. I would like to hear more about these cakes. [Angela and Pam look uncomfortable]",7,21,126
Phyllis," As a person who buys a lot of erotic cakes, it feels good to be represented on one.",7,21,126
Phyllis, [on the phone] You want the 27-26 or the 27-30?,7,21,126
Phyllis, No. [trying to finish her sale when Michael hangs up the phone] I’m on a sale!,7,21,126
Phyllis, Okay… [Jim gives a knowing look to the camera],7,21,126
Phyllis, They’re almost done but my knuckles are swelling a little and-,7,21,126
Phyllis," I’m not a feminist, but I think that the men in this office are being given chances that the women aren’t.",7,22,127
Phyllis, You could put your cell phone in it instead. ,7,23,128
Phyllis," Okay, well, then I want an extra vacation day. ",7,23,128
Phyllis,"  Oh, I’m sure they’ll let us know when they get the results. [Erin crosses fingers and smiles excitedly]  				",7,24,129
Phyllis,  It turns out that Erin was born in the basic time and region that I gave away a child.,7,24,129
Phyllis,"  But, probably not, I mean, it was a big year for babies. Porky’s had come out.",7,24,129
Phyllis,  Are you sure this is a good idea? I hate to see you disappointed.,7,24,129
Phyllis,"  Do you know what it took to get Bob to notice me? I waited in his office every morning wearing nothing but kitty-cat ears. I did that every day for two weeks. And on the tenth day he walked in, he was naked too, except a dog nose. Guess what we did then?",7,24,129
Phyllis,  If my daughter were asking me… [both giggle],7,24,129
Phyllis,"  I would say, if you want someone, if you really want them,… go get them.  				",7,24,129
Phyllis,  I don’t think we should tell her. Angela went a whole day without telling me I had lettuce in my teeth. Screw her.,7,24,129
Phyllis,"  You know, this is probably is her last chance at a family.",7,24,129
Phyllis,  Is it true that you’re making Dwight the manager?,7,24,129
Phyllis,"  He and Kelly said, then they pre-fired me.",7,24,129
Phyllis,"  Yeah. [Oscar looks confused] Yeah, Andy would be wonderful as boss. Erin made a good point. [brushes Erin’s hair with her hand]  				",7,24,129
Phyllis,"  No, we’re not related. I got the call. But… I’ll tell her some other day. [smiles]  				",7,24,129
Phyllis,  It seems like we all know enough to vote. Should we just vote now?,7,24,129
Toby," Hey, we’re not all going to sit in a circle Indian style are we? [Laughing]",1,2,2
Toby," Hey, um did you go to uh, Bishop O’Hara? ",1,6,6
Toby, Um… I need to talk to you in your office. It’ll just take two seconds.,2,2,9
Toby, The full story is that Randall resigned because of sexual harassment. So Corporate asked me to do a five minute review of the Company Sexual Harassment policy.,2,2,9
Toby, And then Corporate is going to send in a lawyer… ,2,2,9
Toby, Maybe not some of them. Maybe not inappropriate ones.,2,2,9
Toby," Yeah, okay. Corporate would like us to do a five minute review of the Company Sexual Harassment policy so I’ll go over that later.",2,2,9
Toby," So remember, intent is irrelevant. And that’s it. Pam?",2,2,9
Toby," Um… in fact, basic rule of thumb, let’s just act everyday like Pam’s Mom’s coming in. All right. That’s it. Um… if anybody has any questions about anything, you know where I sit in the back. ",2,2,9
Toby," Office relationships are never a good idea. Yeah. So let’s just try to avoid them. But, um, if you already have one, you should disclose it to HR. ",2,2,9
Toby," Technically, I am in Human Resources. And Dwight was asking about human anatomy. Um… I’m just sad the public school system failed him so badly.  				",2,2,9
Toby," Yeah, maybe when you get really comfortable with each other, you can ask for that.",2,2,9
Toby," Um, ex-wife. Yeah. Um, her last name is ‘Becker’ now. ",2,6,13
Toby, I got Angela. She is into these posters of babies dressed as adults. I got her one of those. I felt kind of weird buying that.  				,2,10,17
Toby, We’re really not supposed to serve alcohol.,2,10,17
Toby, I don’t think Pam’s gonna want to come into the men’s room.,2,12,19
Toby," No.  Can’t, can’t you just get up yourself?  I… You only grilled your foot.",2,12,19
Toby, You just got your corporate credit card back. Do you really want me to take it away again?  				,2,13,20
Toby," Uh, about a week. Er… .um… .maybe a month. I uh can’t… ",2,17,24
Toby," [to Sasha] Okay, tell them what you wanted to say. ",2,18,25
Toby," Alright, I wasn’t expecting that. Let’s uh… let’s go draw.",2,18,25
Toby, I think these belong to you. [puts toys down on desk],2,18,25
Toby," Believe me, she has enough toys… she doesn’t need your watch.",2,18,25
Toby," Well, you need a wife first, or at least a girlfriend.",2,18,25
Toby," If you really want to have kids, I— I guess you could somehow… foster parent, or something. ",2,18,25
Toby," Didn’t you lose a lot of money on that other investment, the one from the email?",2,19,26
Toby," [to Kevin] Honestly, is there any way you can get on your fiancee’s plan? Our health plan is s… just… it’s terrible.",2,19,26
Toby, I don’t really think people are in the laughing mood.,2,19,26
Toby," Oh, when you sign your job application you agree to comply with random drug testing.   				",2,20,27
Toby," Hookah is not an illegal drug, Michael. ",2,20,27
Toby," No it’s not. It’s a type of pipe. You can fill it with tobacco, often mixed with fruit, or other flavors. ",2,20,27
Toby," Just letting Oscar vent a little. We would use the break room, but the photographer’s back there today.",2,21,28
Toby, It’s just a little dispute over a poster in their workspace.,2,21,28
Toby," Michael, can I talk to you for a uh, second please?",2,21,28
Toby, Here’s how I usually handle this: all I do is listen.,2,21,28
Toby, These things just have a way of working themselves out.,2,21,28
Toby," It’s like if you write someone a letter, when you’re really angry… they say to keep it in a drawer for a couple days. Then you just never end up sending it.",2,21,28
Toby, That was the right decision for me and my marriage.,2,21,28
Toby," Well, good.  We can, uh, throw that one out. [shuffles through papers]",2,21,28
Toby, That… [shakes head and places hand over the file],2,21,28
Toby, [sighs and pulls out a box under his desk] It’s all Dwight’s.  					,2,21,28
Toby," Every Friday at 4, I have a standing appointment with Dwight for him to file a grievance against Jim. I tell him that I’m sending them to a special file in New York. That box is the special file in New York.  					",2,21,28
Toby," Actually, I have a separate folder for complaints against Michael. This [unlocks a drawer]is January through March of this year. [pulls out a fairly large folder]  					",2,21,28
Toby," Yeah, it just means whoever complained came to me later and withdrew it, so I took their name off.",2,21,28
Toby," Fine, I’ll take your name off. [looks at Michael] So no one will know.",2,21,28
Toby," [sits down for his ID picture] Just take it. [flashes goes off, while he is standing back up again]  					",2,21,28
Toby," Actually, I didn’t think it was appropriate to invite children since it’s… You know, there’s gambling and alcohol, and it’s in our dangerous warehouse and it’s a school night… And, you know, Hooters is catering. You know, is that enough? Should I keep going?",2,22,29
Toby," I don’t really play cards, but I’m not gonna lie to you. It felt really good to take money from Michael. Gonna chase that feeling.  				",2,22,29
Toby, OK I think Oscar would just like if you used “lame” or something like that.,3,1,31
Toby, Apparently you called Oscar “faggie” for liking the movie Shakespeare in Love more than an action movie.,3,1,31
Toby," All right Michael, but Oscar’s really gay.",3,1,31
Toby," No, I mean he’s attracted to other men.",3,1,31
Toby," OK, I am telling you, Oscar is an actual homosexual.  Yeah, he told me this morning.  And, obviously he hopes he can count on your discretion.  					",3,1,31
Toby," OK, Michael, are you aware that you ousted Oscar today?",3,1,31
Toby," All right, now Oscar’s feeling discriminated against by his co-workers, primarily Angela, and um, that’s your fault.",3,1,31
Toby," It’s, uh… I was… might ask if you wanted… ",3,2,32
Toby," Um, if, uh… um… I just completely forgot what I was going to say. It’s so weird.",3,2,32
Toby," Michael, look.  I know this is hard for you, but death’s just a part of life.  I mean, just this morning I saw a little bird fly into the glass doors downstairs and die.  And I had to keep going.",3,4,34
Toby," Actually, she’s right. This isn’t appropriate. Why don’t I take these.",3,6,36
Toby," Michael, uh… we shouldn’t be talking about this until all the decisions have been made.",3,7,37
Toby, Jan told me just a few minutes before she told you.,3,7,37
Toby," Well for a minute there, I saw myself selling my house, moving to Costa Rica, learning how to surf. But, Costa Rica will still be there. When I’m 65.   				",3,7,37
Toby," Hey, this came with the Stamford book. [Sets down box that says: Personnel Files Stamford CT Office Confidential] Can you take care of it? ",3,8,38
Toby, How are you? Hey. Welcome back. [puts out fist to bump],3,8,38
Toby," No, it’s nothing. We’ll just… [shakes hand]",3,8,38
Toby, Um… You might want these orientation materials. ,3,8,38
Toby, [answering phone] This is Toby. Hey Pam. Where are you calling from?   				,3,9,39
Toby, Michael. Why’s everyone locked in the conference room?,3,9,39
Toby," Well, you’re going to have to let ’em out. Or… or I will.",3,9,39
Toby," You know they’re teasing you. I mean… obviously, this is… a much nicer place than an actual prison. We get paid to be here. We go home afterwards and have social lives. We have… we have parties here. They’re teasing you. To be funny.",3,9,39
Toby," Come on Dwight. We went over this, like for a half an hour. ",3,10,40
Toby, It’s a dead animal in an office. You can’t… ,3,10,40
Toby, Hey Dwight. Pretty nice robe- [Dwight grabs bag with robe in it and walks away.] Why?   					,3,10,40
Toby," Wish it were true, but it, it uh, seems from that photo that you took, you’ve entered into an intimate relationship. ",3,11,41
Toby," Michael, nine different people emailed me that photo, including my ex-wife… we don’t talk now. ",3,11,41
Toby," You know, for your own protection, you should disclose the relationship to HR.",3,11,41
Toby," All right, if you’re having a relationship with your superior, you must disclose it. ",3,11,41
Toby, The simple solution would be to open a window… if we had… windows that could open.  				,3,16,46
Toby," Oh, this looks great. I’d, I’d love to be there, but my daughter’s play is tonight. … Damnit! You know, one of the other parents will probably videotape it.",3,16,46
Toby," Well, it’s important to support local art, you know. And what they do is not art.  				",3,16,46
Toby, Here. [hands Pam a duck stuffed animal],3,17,47
Toby," Well, we fired Roy, obviously.  And Jim won’t press charges against Roy or the company.",3,18,48
Toby," Yeah, um, but now apparently Darryl has some issue with his…",3,18,48
Toby," There’s a bunch of people back here, maybe…",3,18,48
Toby," I don’t think Michael intended to punish me, by putting Ryan back here with Kelly.  But, if he did intend that?  Wow.  Genius.  				",3,18,48
Toby, Just preparing for the deposition.  				,3,18,48
Toby, This may be the first time that a male subordinate has attempted to get a modest scheduled raise by threatening to withhold sex from a female superior.  It will be a groundbreaking case when it inevitably goes to trial.  				,3,18,48
Toby," Ok, um, one thing that you’re gonna want to look out for is carpal tunnel syndrome.  It’s recommended that you take a ten minute break from typing every hour.  For your circulation, you’re gonna want to get up out of your chairs and uh, and move around about ten minutes every hour.",3,19,49
Toby," Um, yeah.  You’re computer screen can be a big strain on your eyes, so uh, it’s also recommended that you step away for about… about ten minutes every hour.",3,19,49
Toby," No, no.  Um, you always want to keep a sweater or cardigan of some sort, in case it gets drafty. ",3,19,49
Toby, [Creed takes a bite of an apple] Creed is eating an apple.  I found a potato.,3,19,49
Toby," Hey, what’s going on? There’s a police car in the…",3,21,51
Toby, I don’t think laughing about it is an appropriate response.,3,21,51
Toby, I don’t think the women in this office –,3,21,51
Toby," Hey, uh… where’d you decide to take Karen tonight?",3,21,51
Toby, I-I think we hang out an appropriate amount of time.,3,21,51
Toby," No, I did not violate an Indian burial ground. In fact I had some good luck recently, Alfredo’s Pizza, picked my business card out of the basket, so… uh, I got a week of free pies.",4,1,55
Toby," Oh, Michael, you can’t ask about religious beliefs…",4,1,55
Toby," Alright, well then you can ask about religious beliefs.",4,1,55
Toby," I’m makin’ great time. Usually I have to take a bathroom break half way through a race like this, but not today.  				",4,1,55
Toby, [crosses finish line] And the winner is Toby Flenderson.,4,1,55
Toby, He couldn’t have made it a circle?  				,4,1,55
Toby," Yes, uh some people in the office have complained…",4,2,56
Toby," …about some other people engaging in PDA and, you know [Michael leans in closer to Toby] I just wanted to remind it’s not appropriate to, to do that.",4,2,56
Toby," Alright everyone, look, it, alright my complaint was about Jim and Pam. So…",4,2,56
Toby," Oh well, you know, those were only for, you know [makes quotes with fingers] relationships, so… if, if this is just a casual thing, there’s no need, really.",4,2,56
Toby, Let’s just wait and see what happens. [whispers] You know?,4,2,56
Toby," Hey guys.  This is my, uh, girlfriend, Amy.",4,2,56
Toby, [gesturing to the rest of the office] This is everybody else… okay… This is the place… so thanks for the lift.,4,2,56
Toby," Absolutely. [Toby kisses Amy for an extended period of time, Pam and Jim are shocked]",4,2,56
Toby, I wouldn’t want to do that now would I?  							,4,2,56
Toby," It was Ryan wanted Michael, the subject, to explain the computer system, the object.",4,4,58
Toby," To whomever, meaning us, the indirect object. Which is the correct usage of the word.",4,4,58
Toby," I know right?  I just want to go, and look at art, and swim in the Adriatic.",4,6,60
Toby," Alright, just know that you’re not in the Finer Things Club.",4,6,60
Toby, What was fun about it for you?  Was it the death of the twins?,4,6,60
Toby," Oh, it wasn’t camping, it was more of a wilderness retreat. [Michael walks in]",4,7,61
Toby," Under the stars. It was really beautiful, you should come. ",4,7,61
Toby," Me, Dan from Buffalo, Mark Chisholm, Jeff from Albany and Ryan, obviously. Made so many s’mores, that I finally had to say, “No more s’mores, no more s’mores.” [everyone in room but Michael laughs, Michael exits break room]  				",4,7,61
Toby," Ryan invited me to go on his wilderness adventure retreat. It was this amazing, beautiful experience [Michael knocks on the window behind Toby from outside]",4,7,61
Toby," Hey, I just got the word on the communal birthdays. Great idea.",4,7,61
Toby," Well, it… there was. But Michael scheduled it for 4:58 on a Friday. You know, people sang in the parking lot.",4,7,61
Toby," I don’t know, I just thought you could include me.",4,7,61
Toby, I just though you could add me.  I don’t see the harm in that.  				,4,7,61
Toby,"  [in a hospital bed, watching Entourage in Spanish] Oh, I went zip lining my third day in Costa Rica.  I guess the harness wasn’t strapped in exactly right.  I broke my neck.  And, I’ve been in the hospital five weeks now.  I still haven’t seen the beach.  It’s nice to have visitors.  				",5,1,63
Toby," Well that’s sweet, I missed you guys too.",5,8,70
Toby," Well, um, it was amazing.  It really was, thanks for asking.  Um the beaches were pristine…",5,8,70
Toby," …and, yeah, the whole thing was incredibly cathartic.",5,8,70
Toby, It was actually kind of hard to meet people I found.,5,8,70
Toby," Hey, what’s going on?  You don’t have my permission to do this.",5,8,70
Toby," Hey, hey what are- why are you doing this?",5,8,70
Toby, That was… I went to Costa Rica for a few months.  What is going on?,5,8,70
Toby, That is not mine.  I have never seen that before.,5,8,70
Toby," I didn’t put caprese salad in my drawer, Michael.",5,8,70
Toby," You know but the police could have been out there you know, catching real criminals instead of here searching my stuff.",5,8,70
Toby," We should really have the office’s air quality tested. We have radon coming from below, we have asbestos in the ceilings. These are silent killers.",5,9,71
Toby," Michael, we are only allowed to talk about Meredith’s work performance. We can not ask her to stop drinking.",5,10,72
Toby," Michael, We should contact some experts.  You don’t know what your doing.",5,10,72
Toby, Sure. Wow. [Michael throws a pen at his head] Ow…  				,5,10,72
Toby," [on phone] Hey Sasha, it’s daddy.  Have you ever heard of this doll , Princess Unicorn?",5,10,72
Toby," No, No, No.  No, I’m just curious if you’ve heard of it.  				",5,10,72
Toby, This is great.  My ex-wife’s going to be so pissed.  [chuckles] For once daddy’s gonna be a hero.  				,5,10,72
Toby," Hey, I’d like to buy one of your dolls.",5,10,72
Toby," Oh, no, I– no, no, I was gonna buy that doll.",5,10,72
Toby," But I– I promised my daughter. Darryl, look– I– I need the doll, I need the doll.  I– I’m– I’m begging you.  I just– I need it more than anything in this world.  I need this doll. Darryl, man I need this doll.",5,10,72
Toby," [laughs] Oh man, thanks, thank you, [tearing up] thank you, thank you.",5,10,72
Toby, Oh thanks.  She’s gonna… [notices the doll is black] oh…,5,10,72
Toby,  No.  It’s even– it’s even better than the one I wanted.  				,5,10,72
Toby, [to Phyllis and Stanley] What are you guys talking about? I have a daughter. How can I be a virgin?,6,1,81
Toby,   And that’s how you broke your ankle?  ,6,2,82
Toby,     I will send this off to corporate.  Make sure you hold on to your medical bills.  Feel better.,6,2,82
Toby,   A guy on my street fell off a ladder painting his house.  It was on the news.  ,6,2,82
Toby,"   Well, we did a little investigation and Dwight had a good point.  The ladder didn’t reach the top shelf.  I don’t know if I believe it, but I am a fan of the hardboiled detective novel.  [impression] I’ll punch you in da mush, see.    				",6,2,82
Toby,   [spying at Darryl’s house] Sounds like a EMDP-40.,6,2,82
Toby,"   Wow, I’d love to take a look at that.  ",6,2,82
Toby,"   Well, you know, ’cause of  the trains.  ",6,2,82
Toby,"   I can’t believe this. [mistaking Darryl’s sister for Darryl] Hey you, ass****!",6,2,82
Toby,   You gonna eat all that dog food yourself?,6,2,82
Toby,"   Hey Darryl, look ahhh, we’re here to apologize ahh… ",6,2,82
Toby,"   Well, I don’t think there’s any reason to check ’em but I suppose if we wanted to be really certain… ",6,2,82
Toby,"   Ahhh, kay.  Look, we could all file complaints against each other and just drown in a sea of paperwork, but you know, we can just move on with our… with our lives.    				",6,2,82
Toby,   So Dwight and Darryl came to an agreement that both would file complaints with corporate and now I get to do all this paperwork.  We worked it out.  				,6,2,82
Toby," Michael, I have one extra twin bed, if you want.",6,4,84
Toby,  Well I guess this weddings not going to happen.  I wonder if this is it for them.  [Jim and Pam walk in laughing]  				,6,4,84
Toby, Oscar says I checked out huh?  Huh. [nods head]  				,6,5,85
Toby,"  Um, yeah, ah, ah, that means a lot.  Thank you for saying it.",6,6,86
Toby,"  Yeah, er… pull up a chair or sit on the shredder.  ",6,6,86
Toby,"  Ah, you should probably deal with that outside of the work place.  ",6,6,86
Toby,  Yeah… that’s why they pay me the big bucks.  [both laugh],6,6,86
Toby,"  You know, I always knew if Michael just took the time to get to know me, we’d become friends.    				",6,6,86
Toby,"  [walks up to Pam’s desk with a binder] Hey Pam, could I talk to you for a sec?",6,6,86
Toby,"  Well, I was hoping that maybe in light of everything that’s happened today, it would be a good idea if today, you, me, and Michael could head into the conference room for some conflict resolution.  ",6,6,86
Toby,  Maybe you could just take the rest of the day off… you know… ,6,6,86
Toby,"   [gets up and puts a hand on Michael’s shoulder] Buddy, I think that… ",6,6,86
Toby,"  I heard about the hit.  Just– make sure it’s off company property, right?",6,8,88
Toby,"  Okay, I think we should probably be okay.",6,8,88
Toby,  Okay.  And– the-the power– comes from the back foot.  So its– its all one motion through the– body.  So you stay a little low and there’s a twist.  You keep your shoulder down and you kind of throw out the arm.  [demonstrates punch] Pow!,6,8,88
Toby," Wow Michael, like this must be obvious how wrong this is.",6,12,92
Toby," You can’t, [Michael touches his forehead and makes sizzling noise] Ow. Look, you cannot push religion.",6,12,92
Toby, [opening kite from Ryan] Wow! Cause… [reveals Kite Runner book],6,12,92
Toby," Thanks man! [awkwardly tries to hug Ryan, pats him on the back]  ",6,12,92
Toby," Sorry. Hey, Toby Flenderson. Nice to meet you. How can I help?",6,13,93
Toby, Um… nothing comes to mind. [clip montage]  				,6,13,93
Toby," You know, uh, what does it mean to be happy. [shakes head] Keep philosophers busy for awhile.",6,13,93
Toby, I don’t know how I’m going to get through this. I don’t want to lie and I DON’T want to tell the truth.  				,6,13,93
Toby," Well, Eric’s just going over some stuff.",6,13,93
Toby," Look, you know, in any company  there’s going to be certain degrees – ",6,13,93
Toby," Michael, this is really inappropriate to talk about.",6,13,93
Toby, Looks like we kicked it. [indicates water jug is empty]  				,6,14,94
Toby," If we don’t patronise the only Syrian restaurant in town, there’ll be nothing left but pan pizzas and make-your-own salads.  				",6,18,98
Toby," Does it have to be pizza? Could go for a, falafel?",6,18,98
Toby," [standing behind Erin] I don’t think this fax is going through. Is there a different… I can just put it through again, you know.  				",6,20,100
Toby," I called Tallahassee. He can ask you not to come in, but he can’t dock your pay. That’s not legal.",6,20,100
Toby," Yeah, I also learned some interesting things about how they structure…",6,20,100
Toby,"  Come on, Michael. You’re interrupting.",6,23,103
Toby," Oh, wow, this is, uh, just a mystery novel that I’ve been working on.",6,24,104
Toby," Guys, I think Michael and Luke are related. ",7,1,106
Toby," Yeah, I’m really looking forward to working with you, Michael.",7,1,106
Toby,"  Michael has been assigned six hours of mandatory counseling with a trained professional. I actually have a degree in social work. I mean, I know a lot of people would ask a few standard questions, and check off a few boxes, but I’ve got a chance to do some good here.   				",7,2,107
Toby,"  I’d like you to imagine a place where you feel very peaceful. For me, it’s the walk from the yogurt shop to my car after I drop my daughter off on Sunday afternoons.   				",7,2,107
Toby,"  Ok, I can’t count the hour if you don’t talk. ",7,2,107
Toby,"  Michael, it’s up to me to check off the boxes, and I can’t do that unless I honestly…",7,2,107
Toby,  I think we might be about to maybe really get somewhere.  				,7,2,107
Toby,  Come on Michael. Those are all fake stories. ,7,2,107
Toby,"  You know what Michael? You’re right. You win. This is pointless. We’re not getting anywhere. I got a bunch of fun stuff, in case my daughter ever comes over. Why don’t we just run out the clock by playing games, drawing some pictures, talking?  				",7,2,107
Toby,  We can play something more complicated if you like.,7,2,107
Toby,  Its really sad that your dog ran away. Why did it keep you from going to the park?,7,2,107
Toby,"  It’s very important for you to be liked, isn’t it?",7,2,107
Toby,  [tossing forms at Michael] Just fill them out any way you want.,7,2,107
Toby,  I’ll have Erin fax them back to corporate. ,7,2,107
Toby,  You filled them in and faxed them yourself!,7,2,107
Toby,  Unless part of you made that mistake on purpose. ,7,2,107
Toby," [leans hobo sack against the refrigerator] It’s a great stick, right?",7,6,111
Toby," Sunday church service… it’s been a few years. The Big Guy and I, we got some catching up to do.  				",7,7,112
Toby," [stands outside church entrance] Okay, this is, all right, this is silly. [goes inside] [walks back out] Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope…   				",7,7,112
Toby," [standing in the church sanctuary, talking to the stained glass] Why you always got to be so mean to me?  				",7,7,112
Toby," Uh, I just wanted to let you know that, uh, I’ll be taking a leave of absence starting next week.",7,11,116
Toby," Uh, no, the opposite. I was actually selected to be a juror on a very high-profile case.",7,11,116
Toby," Okay, that’s hurtful talk. We’ve talked about that. You know, I don’t interrupt your announcements.",7,11,116
Toby," Well, I really can’t talk about it, but it’s a very high profile case.",7,11,116
Toby," Guys, it’s a really big deal. [rubs his neck]",7,11,116
Toby, I can neither confirm nor deny this. Let’s just say I’ll be up to my neck in jury duty. [excited outbursts],7,11,116
Toby, Corporate will be sending someone else to take my place for a while.,7,11,116
Toby," Uh, Holly Flax, she comes from the Nashua branch.",7,11,116
Toby," Yeah, uh, she’ll be starting next week. If you have any questions about the transition, just let me know.",7,11,116
Toby," Uh, we’re on recess. I came for the party. Hey, everyone.",7,11,116
Toby, I can’t talk about it or I’ll get removed from the jury.,7,11,116
Toby," I know people are only this excited to talk to me because of the trial. But, they talk to me for a while, and maybe people realize I have something to say. And then one day, we’re just talking.  				",7,11,116
Toby," There’s this female uh, uh, stenographer at the courthouse…",7,11,116
Toby," No, I would never ever do anything like that. But it does seem like something you would do.",7,11,116
Toby," I really disagree with this. I think it’s kind of hateful. Though I am a little happy right now to have a platform to talk about the outcome of a case I was recently a juror on. The Scranton Strangler. That man’s being put to death. I was part of the verdict, and I’m not so sure he’s guilty any more. [Dwight plays a clip from the song Oh Yeah:",7,20,125
Toby," Well you know Michael, I have a brother in Boulder. Rory Flenderson. You should look him up.",7,21,126
Toby," [on video cam with his brother] Here’s the thing Rory, I knew you guys would hit it off in an odd way.",7,21,126
Toby, Do- Well you should give him a little time to settle in. But-,7,21,126
Toby," [excitedly] Oh, I should get the accident report binder. I’ve never used the gun violence forms before. ",7,23,128
Toby, I am supposed to collect eyewitness accounts. Who saw Dwight do this? [all raise their hands],7,23,128
Toby, Would you consider this a terrorist incident? ,7,23,128
Toby," Oh, there’s a whole ‘nother terrorism booklet for that.",7,23,128
Toby," Uh, well, we probably don’t want to go just on seniority.",7,23,128
Toby,"  I’m sorry, what is your three-step plan?",7,24,129
Toby,  How will your experience selling refinery equipment translate to our smaller scale here?,7,24,129
Toby,"  So, how would you go about settling interpersonal conflicts within the office?",7,24,129
Toby,"  Well, it’s one of my strengths, but it’s the manager’s job.",7,24,129
Toby,"  Well, why would you need relocation, if you already live in Scranton?",7,24,129
Toby,"  I’m sorry, if we did something to upset you, I’m sure it was inadvertent.",7,24,129
Toby,"  Well, we could try him out for a little while… [Jim drops his pen, looks exasperated] and if it doesn’t work out, you know, maybe one of us could, you know, step in…",7,24,129
Toby,"  No, no,… no. Sorry. We cut Kevin off for the same thing. You have to have something to say, if you talk. [Angela rolls her eyes and stops talking]",7,24,129
Gabe, Oh. Okay. And to you. [begins applauding]  				,6,14,94
Gabe," Um, hi, uh, my name is Gabe Lewis. I am coordinating director for merging regions.",6,14,94
Gabe, We are very impressed with this branch and we are so excited about this merger. ,6,14,94
Gabe," Um, actually, if you don’t mind, I would love to put this on the Sabre website. [correctly pronounced “say-ber”]",6,14,94
Gabe," Most of our business comes from selling printers. So don’t think of yourselves as paper salesmen anymore, but as printer salesmen who also sell paper. ",6,14,94
Gabe," At Sabre, we really encourage honest communication. You should always feel free to express your thoughts, your – ",6,14,94
Gabe," We have a policy here at Sabre where we are, uh, allowed to take two weeks.",6,14,94
Gabe," Actually, that’s Nick. He’s your new IT guy. Uh, he’s setting up a site blocker. Mostly blocking the inappropriate sites.  And then there are the time-wasting sites like Twitter, YouTube. We are blocking those as well.  				",6,14,94
Gabe," Ok, did everyone get one? With these bottles, we eliminate the need for plastic water bottles, which are the scourge of the environment. ",6,14,94
Gabe, Little cups? Like paper or plastic or… ?,6,14,94
Gabe," Ok, well, I bet you can fit 20 little cups of water in your aluminum bottle.",6,14,94
Gabe," Oh, I don’t get that sense at all from you, so…",6,14,94
Gabe," Well, I wish that I could do something, but it’s kind of policy, you know? Above my pay grade. You know?",6,14,94
Gabe, You know what? Let me see what I can do.  				,6,14,94
Gabe," [on videochat]  First let me say that I told them everything you wanted me to say, in just the way you wanted me to say it, so…",6,14,94
Gabe," Ok, um, I told the story of your uncle, and I have a feeling that you would have [Michael gesturing behind computer] really been proud of the way… Okay, um…",6,14,94
Gabe," This is Michael Scott, co-regional manager of this branch.",6,15,95
Gabe, Over here is Meredith Palmer and Creed Bratton.,6,15,95
Gabe," That is Jim Halpert, he is the co-regional manager of this office.",6,15,95
Gabe," Oh, he is. He’s the co-manager, and that’s the other co-manager.",6,15,95
Gabe, Um. I set my stuff up in there. So…  just give me a few minutes to clean that out for you.,6,17,97
Gabe, You never know with Jo. Sometimes we’re here til midnight. Sometimes she doesn’t show up for three days.,6,17,97
Gabe," Yeah, that would be awesome. I could get a girlfriend. Wouldn’t have to go to Amsterdam seven times a year. But uh, I’m young, right?  I will date when I’m dead! [Laughs]  				",6,17,97
Gabe," [on phone] Michael, we spent a lot of money on those leads. You have to give them out.",6,18,98
Gabe," Michael, I don’t want to incentivise murder. But – we’ve tried to make it clear that our policy emphasises sales staff – ",6,18,98
Gabe,"  – of supporting the sales staff. You are required to hand out those leads, Michael. ",6,18,98
Gabe, Why do you keep repeating – [Michael hangs up]  				,6,18,98
Gabe," It’s awful. [reaches for tissue box, hands it to Kevin]",6,20,100
Gabe, The beginning here has been a little bit of a fiasco. Either they don’t respect me or they respect me too much. And some of them still think that I’m the I.T. guy. This Cookie Monster thing is an opportunity to show people that I’m an authority figure.   				,6,20,100
Gabe," Hello, everyone. If I might have a moment of your time. It’s come to my attention that people have been watching and laughing at a hurtful parody video. It is now forbidden to talk, joke about, or e-mail this around. ",6,20,100
Gabe," And that’s straight from corporate. So not to be scary, but yeah, I would listen to me. And that’s all. Ciao.   				",6,20,100
Gabe," Guys, why don’t we leave the parodies to the pros at Mad TV?",6,20,100
Gabe," I should probably get involved in this, but I think my energy is better spent on the Cookie Monster issue.  				",6,20,100
Gabe," Ok. Ok there. I heard that. So I’m sorry, Pam, but that’s it. I’m going to have to suspend you without pay for two days.",6,20,100
Gabe," Yeah, you’re right. You know what? Um, you’re suspended too Jim. [Dwight starts to clap] Ok fine. You too Dwight.",6,20,100
Gabe, [talking on the phone] So I can reprimand them but I can’t suspend them. Oh I can’t do either. Uh huh. Fair enough.  				,6,20,100
Gabe," Hey everyone. Hi. Quite an afternoon, huh? Cathartic in a way. I’m glad I got to share it with you. It makes you think about what’s really important. [Pam hands Jim a note] It’s not about showing you’re in charge or flexing some sort of authority. It’s about forgiveness. And yes, I’m talking about you three in this desk clump right here. I think that, if you were to apologize to me, then I would revoke your suspension. ",6,20,100
Gabe," Guys, I would even take a contrite look as an apology. ",6,20,100
Gabe," [following Jim and Pam to their car] Guys, to err is human. [trying to block their car]  				",6,20,100
Gabe, [walking back into the office] That was ugly. I’m sorry you had to see that.,6,20,100
Gabe, It’s tacky to discuss finances. It’s best to pretend that this never happened.,6,20,100
Gabe, Can I buy everyone coffees? [everyone shakes their heads] [in Cookie Monster voice] “Or cookies.”,6,20,100
Gabe, You got to be able to laugh at yourself. I’m one of the gang. ,6,20,100
Gabe, Why don’t we say ciao to the impressions? [everyone says ciao]  				,6,20,100
Gabe," You would have weekly conference calls with executives in corporate. A two-week training program at the Yale school of management, obviously you would be high on the list for advancement opportunities. ",6,21,101
Gabe," Oh, this is “Print in All Colors,” Sabre’s minority executive training program. ",6,21,101
Gabe, Those don’t really count. We’re thinking more ethnic and racial minorities.,6,21,101
Gabe," Darryl withdrew his application. He said the Yale program interfered with his softball league, you know? He’s gone.   				",6,21,101
Gabe," Yeah, unless somebody else applies today.",6,21,101
Gabe, That’s very nice. [referring to Kelly’s bindi] I never noticed that before.,6,21,101
Gabe," Yeah. I don’t want to be offensive but, uh… may I ask you what that means?",6,21,101
Gabe," Well, uh… why don’t you just tell me a little about yourself, Hide.",6,21,101
Gabe," Everyone, it is my pleasure to announce our newest member of the Sabre minority executive training program. Kelly Rajnigandha Kapoor. [clapping] All right.  				",6,21,101
Gabe, They’re going to be pretty pleased in Tallahassee that I snagged an Indian for the program. She’ll be the first. The program’s mostly black. It’s almost too black. That didn’t sound right.  				,6,21,101
Gabe," There’s no way that you guys have any almond butter, right? ",6,22,102
Gabe, That’s weird. I haven’t heard of that happening. I would even settle for apricot preserves.,6,22,102
Gabe," I don’t know. Call HQ, see if they know anything. Yeah. That’s what I’ll do today. All right. Yeah.",6,22,102
Gabe," [to Andy] I talked to corporate. Turns out there have been 12 reports of faulty printers. Out of 400,000. [smiles] We’ve investigated. Every time it’s been user error.  They block the vents or something, I don’t know. That’s why we have the fine print. Thank you for bringing this to our attention. So I’d like to reward you for that. [pulls out gift card] That’s god for five bucks at Dunkin’ Donuts. Any Dunkin’ Donuts. [Andy looks over at Darryl and Darryl motions for Andy to go to him]  				",6,22,102
Gabe,  Can you two please join me in my office? Now.,6,23,103
Gabe,"  I don’t wanna be the heavy here, but honestly, guys, this makes us all look bad. ",6,23,103
Gabe,"  Good. Okay. End of the dressing down. I just hate that part of the job, you know, the power dynamics. ",6,23,103
Gabe,"  Okay. That’s great, actually, because I wanted to talk to you about something else.",6,23,103
Gabe,"  I’m sure you got my email about the printer fires. The one with the branching decision tree? I actually designed that chart. Kinda hoping it catches on. [Jim and Pam struggling to stay awake] Anyway, the question is, what is the best way to disseminate important information in an efficient way?",6,23,103
Gabe," [as Michael and Jo leave] Are you leaving? Oh, am I… should I continue with the investigation?   				",6,24,104
Gabe," What a rich timbre your voice has. Okay, I am prepared to conclude the investigation. And… you did it. [nods at Andy]",6,24,104
Gabe," Uh, just all the evidence. And it really seems like it was you. Can we all agree to say that it was Andy for now, and sit with it, see how it feels?",6,24,104
Gabe, I’m gonna head back to Siberia there. Ciao. [he and Erin kiss]  				,7,1,106
Gabe," I started dating Erin this summer. It has been, in a word, exquisite.  				",7,1,106
Gabe," That’d be hilarious. Uh, “Jo, they’re creating a hostile work environment. Stop  ’em.”",7,1,106
Gabe," Those overnight packages needed to go out, and Michael refuses to hold the guilty party accountable.",7,1,106
Gabe," Michael, you just physically assaulted an employee. Can we talk in private? ",7,1,106
Gabe, Legal says the best way to protect us from a lawsuit is to call this a stress-induced outburst.  You will have to undergo six sessions of counseling.,7,1,106
Gabe," And, uh, you will do your counseling right here, because our HR staff are all certified counselors. ",7,1,106
Gabe," The alternative is termination. [Michael stares off, considering termination…]   				",7,1,106
Gabe,  Oh boy. Can you get every department head’s signature on this so I can back this up to corporate?,7,2,107
Gabe,"  So, Corporate got your evaluations, and they want me to check, is that really how you feel about Michaels situation?",7,2,107
Gabe,"  You marked severe in all the categories, including at risk for homicidal behavior. ",7,2,107
Gabe,"  I’m back! Ha ha. Pam, perfect. I was hoping to talk to the office administrator about a little office administration problem. ",7,2,107
Gabe,"  The problem, unfortunately, is about the office administrator. I have gone through everything for the past three years. There is nothing that says you are the office administrator. ",7,2,107
Gabe,"  Pam, I don’t want to accuse you of anything. I just want everything to be back the way it’s supposed to be. Can you just admit… admit…",7,2,107
Gabe,"  Statements of such nature, while they have their place, are overused in a competitive business environment. ",7,2,107
Gabe,  Will do… Can I get one of those name plates… that says Gabe Lewis?,7,2,107
Gabe, This wasn’t really about Meredith was it. You and Erin are broken up.,7,4,109
Gabe," I asked you if it was ok if I asked her out. You said, and I quote, ‘My good sir! Nothing would make me happier than to hand you the hand of the hand once in my hand.’ I specifically remember it because you said it in such a weird way.",7,4,109
Gabe," I’ll let this slide, but I expect you to put this whole Erin thing behind you.  				",7,4,109
Gabe," [dressed as Lady Gaga] In case you can’t read m-m-my Poker Face… [laughs] we will be reviewing our sales policies. [accepts note from Michael, reads it out loud] I have ten seconds to read them or this whole place blows up.",7,6,111
Gabe,"  When our warehouse workers make deliveries, they’re going to be encouraged to offer clients extra products. And then they will split those commissions with sales.",7,6,111
Gabe," Uh uh. Corporate stole nothing, okay? Darryl told me, and then I told them, giving Darryl full credit, so… no need to [mimicking Andy] screw corporate! Or anything like that, so. Let’s give Darryl a round of applause, as planned. [claps]  				",7,6,111
Gabe," In the future, you need to get Michael’s approval on anything before coming to me. ",7,6,111
Gabe," Okay, well, obviously if it’s a really, really good idea, my door is open. ",7,6,111
Gabe," Ohh. Dropping bombs, right? [explosion noise] This really make you think, Michael?",7,6,111
Gabe," Okay. We’re going to table the hat question. The best ideas are going to come to me, I make the final decision, period.",7,6,111
Gabe," Okay, why don’t we simplify this? Darryl brings it to Michael, Michael brings it to me, no one calls Jo.",7,6,111
Gabe," Well, you have a job to do. Okay, there is no off-season when it comes to printer sales.",7,7,112
Gabe," Okay, while this is interesting we should get back to work. These stand-offs can last a long time. What if it’s another Waco.",7,8,113
Gabe," So these are your cheeses, your ham, your sausages, your herbs, and your vegetables. Here’s what’s been done, so start creating. Some times it helps to think of a part of the world, and…",7,8,113
Gabe, [walking with Jim and Pam] Welcome to my Man Cave! I did my senior year in prog in Japan. Best year of my life.,7,8,113
Gabe," Oh! I like to play soundscapes. I imagine one instant of a song, expanded to be the size of the universe.",7,8,113
Gabe, [lowers volum] Some of us are trying to have a conversation.,7,8,113
Gabe, Michael! You are making this harder than it has to be.,7,8,113
Gabe, [Andy is leaning over toilet] What happened?,7,8,113
Gabe," I’ve got just the thing! [leaves, comes back with a synthesizer] This one’s called Earth Rise, on the Moon. [music plays]",7,8,113
Gabe," Is this job really about the money for you, Jim? I mean, isn’t this where you fell in love? ",7,9,114
Gabe," When you’re dealing with a large organization, sometimes you have to put up with policies you don’t like. I wish my gym didn’t allow full nudity in the locker room. Okay, seeing these old guys walking around naked feels almost passive-aggressive. But I deal with it. ‘Cause it’s policy. See what I mean? ",7,9,114
Gabe," My gym allows it. I wish they didn’t, but it’s policy. So I respect it, and I just–[put’s his hands cupped by his face and turns away] keep a low–you know, I look away. Think about your commission cap as a naked old man in a gym locker room.   ",7,9,114
Gabe," Hey, Jim? Are you distracting these people?",7,9,114
Gabe, We just want to say how grateful we are.  				,7,11,116
Gabe," Kelly, I thought we agreed on fleece blankets.",7,11,116
Gabe, Erin and I make great use of ours.  				,7,11,116
Gabe," Yes, Erin and I are still dating. Why do you ask me so often if we’re still dating?  				",7,11,116
Gabe, I’m not sure the temporary replacement of an H.R. rep really warrants a party.,7,11,116
Gabe, Yet another opportunity where a blanket would have come in handy.  				,7,11,116
Gabe, I picked out our movie. It’s called “Suspiria”. It pushes all the boundaries. All your preconceived notions about what horror can be come crashing down. ,7,13,118
Gabe," It is hard to explain why Erin is doing so well today. The only thing I can think is Erin is living out some “Slumdog Millionaire” scenario, where every word she’s playing has a connection to her orphan past. It’s possible.   ",7,13,118
Gabe," Well, that’s actually what I came to talk to you about. I know how much you want to watch “Wall-e”. ",7,13,118
Gabe," So I got us a compromise. This movie’s called “Hardware”. It tells the story of a killer combat robot, just like Wall-e, that the government invented to destroy humans. It’s some of what you like and some of what I like, and… married… ",7,13,118
Gabe," Ok, I’m sorry but I am going to have to shut this down. ",7,14,119
Gabe, Unless we can all agree to some ground rules. It’s either that or I can fax this to Joe and let her decide how to proceed. ,7,14,119
Gabe," Number one, and this should be obvious, no captions that insult the company we work for. ",7,14,119
Gabe," I think we can all agree that they tend to alienate those who don’t get the reference, making them feel like the other. ",7,14,119
Gabe, Sticky Quips are fun. They are safe. They are handy. I like to use Sticky Quips as regular Post-It notes when I am in a fun mood. [laughs] Not every day.   ,7,14,119
Gabe," Oh, come on. My rules could not possibly have been that oppressive. ",7,14,119
Gabe, Too late! Oh. Ha. An IM chat. Very clever. I’ll just print that out. Come on guys. Grow up. I don’t want to be your babysitter. ,7,14,119
Gabe, “Darn it Bob. I told you not to buy a Sabre brand lifeboat.” [laughter],7,14,119
Gabe," No, not nice. Terrible. Doesn’t even include the fact that they’re dogs. ",7,14,119
Gabe," “Wake up, Fred. The power cord on your Sabre printer shocked you into a coma, and you’re dreaming you’re a dog on a desert island.’ ",7,14,119
Gabe," Uh, excuse me, excuse me. How does the speaker know what the guy in the coma is dreaming?",7,14,119
Gabe," Umm… “You don’t have to sniff my rear end anymore, Bob, I’m the only one here.” Ha. ",7,14,119
Gabe," More tasteless than this…”is that a palm tree or did Gabe get skinnier? Either way, let’s pee on it.”  [laughter] ",7,14,119
Gabe," “Oh, thank God. I had a horrible nightmare that I was stuck in America with Gabe.”",7,14,119
Gabe," “I know what it smells like but I didn’t roll in anything. It’s from listening to all of Gabe’s bull[bleep]. [laughter] “Isn’t this the perfect romantic getaway, Erin? Sitting on a deserted island wearing dog costumes? I’m Gabe and I’m a weirdo.” ",7,14,119
Gabe," “Gabe’s mom… hmm… Gabe’s mom? Wait. Tall woman? Looks like Gabe? Yeah, I banged her.”",7,14,119
Gabe, I dominate Valentine’s Day. I practically make romance into a science.   				,7,15,120
Gabe," Oh, close. It’s a romantic treasure hunt. A scavenger hunt is where you find items from a master list. This is where you follow clues that lead to a prize. Common misuse. Good luck. ",7,15,120
Gabe," [to Toby] I hear them kissing all the time. It’s this horrible plipping sound. You know, it’s like Chinese water torture. Just…[makes popping sound] like it’s coming from my own head. ",7,15,120
Gabe, Thank you all for meeting on such sort notice. ,7,15,120
Gabe," Seeing as it’s Valentine’s Day, I felt it would be apropos to have a little refresher course on romance in the workplace. ",7,15,120
Gabe," First things first. An office romance is permissible. Not something you’d expect to hear from corporate. Well, guess what. Sabre is 100% tolerant of office romances. ",7,15,120
Gabe," I get it. Andy’s slamming my girlfriend. Very funny. What I do not approve of, however, is public displays of affection, or PDAs. PDAs are totally superfluous to a happy, healthy office romance. Perfect example. Look at Jim and Pam. ",7,15,120
Gabe, They don’t touch. They don’t kiss. You would hardly even know that they were husband and wife. ,7,15,120
Gabe," Okay. So, PDAs. That’s gonna include behaviors such as hugging, kissing, uh…",7,15,120
Gabe," Sure. Basically, there’s no precise definition, but you know it when you see it. Ahem. ",7,15,120
Gabe," No one is a bigger fan of sexual touching than me. But with you two, it’s reaching the level of a complex. I can think of three explanations. One:",7,15,120
Gabe," First thing’s first, thank you for coming here directly. I know you could have called Tallahassee but they would’ve just looped back to me, so, it’s cool you recognized my role here.",7,19,124
Gabe, Ahh. There you go. Get a recommendation from Michael. That’ll put you right on the shortlist for next time there’s an opening.,7,19,124
Gabe," …I’m sorry, I never know how to act in these awkward-type situations.  				",7,19,124
Gabe," [stands up and walks to stage, takes the microphone] Well, this is embarrassing, um, I’m obviously really angry at Erin. It’s that quarter life crisis everyone’s been talking about. [Jim is looking wide eyed, jaw dropped] Alright I’m gonna go. [Dwight plays cricket noises]",7,20,125
Gabe, [sees Andy walk into the Men’s Room and follows him in] Stay away from Erin! [cornering him in the bathroom],7,21,126
Gabe," No, I’m gonna stand where I want. Okay? You don’t wanna get on my bad side! I’ve seen some horrible things! I own over two hundred horror movies!  ",7,21,126
Gabe," No! You go away! [storms out, toilet flushes, Jim exits the bathroom]",7,21,126
Gabe," [Andy walks by with DeAngelo, says quietly after he leaves] Walk away bitch.    				",7,21,126
Gabe," Someday, you are going to tell our grandchildren about how their grandfather won you back in a women’s room.",7,21,126
Gabe," Just read the letter under your windshield wiper, it explains everything. Quick one. [leans in for a kiss]",7,21,126
Gabe," [sounding hurt] I’m either going to quit today, or stay to make sure that Andy’s career is destroyed.",7,21,126
Gabe," [holding ball in open palm] Oh, yeah, totally.  Jim, you got ripped off big time.",7,22,127
Gabe, Give or take. [Deangelo walks out]  				,7,22,127
Gabe," Well, that’s gonna be tough, because we’re getting a dunking clinic from Magic Jordan himself.",7,22,127
Gabe," Droswip, yeah.  I get it.  Okay, we’re gonna get you to the restroom.   				",7,22,127
Gabe, Can I talk to you a second about these client memos?,7,23,128
Gabe," Because I am. I need to get her back. [crying] I can’t be alone anymore. Andy, do you like being alone with me right now?",7,23,128
Gabe," No. I don’t like being alone with me either, okay? I have to get her back. Are you still gonna date her?",7,23,128
Gabe," No, just give me a second. I don’t want anyone to know I’ve been crying.   				",7,23,128
Gabe," Erin, I am in love with you. I don’t believe in much, okay? I don’t believe in horoscopes. I don’t believe in Christmas. Uh, uh, I sure as hell don’t believe in God. [Erin and Angela both look taken aback] ",7,23,128
Gabe," Or maybe there’s a God. I don’t know. I mean, it’s just not a guy with a long white beard. [Erin looks shocked] Or it could be. I mean, it’s possible that that is exactly what – what God is. But for all of the disbelief [phone rings] I believe in us. I believe in love. You have made me believe that for all of the hokum [phone continues ringing] out… there… uh, do we not have voicemail? ",7,23,128
Gabe, Well… it’s just… [ringing] it messes up my rhythm.   				,7,23,128
Gabe, I can’t reach Jo. She must already be on the plane.,7,23,128
Gabe, No! We really shouldn’t be without a receptionist. Now more than ever.,7,23,128
Gabe," Hey, Andy, did you tell Erin about our conversation earlier when you said you would never want to date her again?  ",7,23,128
Gabe, I just thought that it was so interesting that you promised that.,7,23,128
Gabe,"  Well… it’s an interview, and we don’t know that you really have the plan.",7,24,129
Gabe,"  Okay, I-I am, I’m almost a little concerned that you might be overqualified for the position. [Robert and Gabe chuckle at this, then Gabe stops chuckling] Do you, um, do you think that you are?",7,24,129
Gabe,  No. [Robert then nods his head at Jim],7,24,129
Gabe,  Oh? Uh… we haven’t started the interview yet. Were you–were you joking?,7,24,129
Gabe,  Whoa! That’s a very heavy accusation to level against Toby.,7,24,129
Gabe,"  Well, Toby’s in charge of Human Resources, that would include communication. I think that Toby’s done a fine job.",7,24,129
Gabe,"  I have two relationships with Andy. I have a personal relationship, and I have a professional relationship. Personally, yeah, I think he’s a rat, and I think he’s responsible for the demise of my relationship with Erin. Professionally,… he broke up the happiest couple in this office!  				",7,24,129
Gabe,  How many windows are there in New York City?,7,24,129
Gabe,"  Critical thinking. Common, on-the-spot question asked in an interview.",7,24,129
Gabe,"  Shut up about the Sun! SHUT UP about the SUN! [slams fist, hurting his hand]  				",7,24,129
Gabe,"  Great! [to Jim and Toby] Um, can we just… [does a “wrap it up” motion with his pen]",7,24,129
Gabe,"  We just have a lot of serious candidates to get through today, so… [nods]",7,24,129
Gabe,"  What do you want me to say? I mean, there’s a line of qualified people out there. We have a video CV from England. [to Jim and Toby] Are we all just gonna pretend to– okay. [to Kelly] Um, what are your weaknesses?",7,24,129
Gabe,"  How would you compare, like, an accountant and HR?",7,24,129
Gabe,"  Very unprofessional, “Jacques.” Or, should I say, Dwight.",7,24,129
Gabe,  How much time do you have? Sales ability? None. Integrity? See sales ability. [makes a “zero” hand gesture],7,24,129
Gabe,"  Oh, Jo. Jo, I’m disappointed in you. Some people let personal things into the workpl-. Is she with him? Because I thought that she was…",7,24,129
Gabe,"  Oh, well I’m still the corporate liaison to the branch.",7,24,129
Gabe,"  Okay, you know what, you don’t need to make that sound.",7,24,129
Gabe,"  There are plenty of people who love touching me. [camera zooms to Ryan, who looks at the camera, extremely skeptical] I’m a terrific hugger. I’ve been with a bunch of girls where that’s basically all they want to do. I will see you all soon.",7,24,129
Holly,  And arch your back. And slowly bring up your head. [Michael and Holly face each other in yoga pose]  				,5,1,63
Holly,  I’m not a lesbian. I don’t know why I said that… It’s a joke.,5,1,63
Holly,  There is no joke. I just said it because I haven’t had much luck lately and I’m not really looking to date. Maybe I should switch to women.,5,1,63
Holly,"  Um, I’m gonna head back to my work area and just–",5,1,63
Holly,"  Hey, Oscar. Who’s that woman in Michael’s office with the feet?",5,1,63
Holly,"  So, listen, I don’t know if your offer still stands or whatever, but you can give your yoga teacher my number.",5,1,63
Holly,  He is mentally challenged. But he’s doing a super job here.,5,1,63
Holly,"  I have a crazy idea. What if we did, um, fruit instead of cake?",5,1,63
Holly,"  Hey, could I have a rain check on the mini-golf. I, uh, actually have a date tonight.",5,1,63
Holly,"  It’ll probably be a total disaster, but…",5,1,63
Holly,"  It’s kind of a good news, bad news situation.  The bad news is we’re not doing very well, so we really had to starve ourselves this whole week. But the good news is that all the other branches are doing just as bad as we are, so corporate upped the prize to five days.  So if we stay fat long enough, we may actually get a whole month off.  				",5,1,63
Holly,"  Ok, let’s just all try and work harder, ok?",5,1,63
Holly,"  Eight point five.  I got a red wine stain on my favorite shirt.  But he’s cute, right?",5,1,63
Holly,  And exercise. Although I know everybody loves going to the gym.,5,1,63
Holly,  “…or that Dunder Mifflin does not discriminate.  Nor does it condone unhealthy dieting habits or extreme weight loss strategies.  As was clearly stated in the official starting—“,5,1,63
Holly,"  Oh, I had a good time, but it’s been three days and no call.  I even have two tickets to see Counting Crows for tonight, so…",5,1,63
Holly,  I just got off… Kendall?  I just got off…,5,1,63
Holly,  And you know what?  I even got two tickets to see the Counting Crows tonight as a surprise.  Why do guys not call when they say they are gonna call?,5,1,63
Holly,"  Thanks.  That’s sweet.  Anyways, umm, seems like we lost to Utica by only eight pounds.",5,1,63
Holly,"  Well, at least everyone lost weight.  That’s all that really matters.",5,1,63
Holly,"  So we’re only eight pounds behind Utica.  Now, I know it’s a stretch but we could weigh ourselves again at the end of the day and maybe win this thing after all.",5,1,63
Holly,  I’m calling it.  I guess that’s curtains for the yoga guy.,5,1,63
Holly," Pencils down! [Dwight quickly puts his pencil down] Just kidding, take your time.  				",5,2,64
Holly," Today is ethics day.  After they finish their quiz I’m going to run my first ethics meeting here.  It’s gonna be insaaaaane.  No, it’s not.  I have to read from the binder.  				",5,2,64
Holly," Thanks Michael. [Michael groans exhaustingly] Today we’re going to have a business ethics seminar because recently, without mentioning any names, there has been some misconduct at corporate and we have a very strict ethics policy and that employee has been fired.",5,2,64
Holly," Let’s start discussing those questionnaires that you filled in this morning.  It is wrong to make personal calls during work hours. Now, some of you marked that you very strongly agree.  But ideally you would have selected totally agree.",5,2,64
Holly, Corporate would like to emphasize that ideally you would all totally agree with that statement.,5,2,64
Holly," Thank you.  In fact, spending a half hour at the water cooler during work hours is a form of stealing.",5,2,64
Holly," Yes, it’s called time theft, and it’s the same as taking money from the company.  Can anyone think of examples of things that are over the line time wasters?",5,2,64
Holly, Stealing office supplies is another big ethical area that there seems to be some confusion about.,5,2,64
Holly," Well, I just have to get through the binder.",5,2,64
Holly," Ok. [to everyone] Michael makes a really good point so, uh, let’s just open this up a little bit. Say my name is Lauren and here I am shopping in a supermarket and I steal a pencil.  That’s not right.",5,2,64
Holly," No, I have to go over pencils and office supplies.  It’s part of the ethics thing.",5,2,64
Holly," Ok, but we should get back to business.  Have any of you ever faced any ethical dilemmas in the workplace.",5,2,64
Holly," No— I, I’d like to hear more about that.",5,2,64
Holly," Meredith, that is serious.  I mean not only that a conflict of interests, there’s also an exchange of goods.",5,2,64
Holly," Michael, there is some serious issues with Meredith.",5,2,64
Holly, I mean all of you have done things I wouldn’t have done myself but Meredith’s actions are really over the line.,5,2,64
Holly," So, regarding this supplier, approximately how many liaisons have there been?",5,2,64
Holly," No, it’s not a formality.  Now, were these, um, meet-ups just personal?  Unrelated to business?",5,2,64
Holly," What I don’t understand is… why the steak coupons?  I mean, if you were already getting the discounted paper?",5,2,64
Holly, Well unfortunately immunity or something being off the record does not really exist in the workplace.  I mean I’ve never heard of anyone who’s kept their job after something like this.,5,2,64
Holly, Maybe we should talk about Meredith first.,5,2,64
Holly," Ok, so I have gone over this and I have thought about it and I just don’t think there is any way I can write a report that doesn’t end with her being terminated.",5,2,64
Holly," Well, that’s very sweet but we have to follow the protocol.  Those are the rules.",5,2,64
Holly," No, you are saying that we should sweep it under the carpet, accept the discount on supplies, not fire Meredith and pretend like the whole thing never happened.",5,2,64
Holly, I’m saying that her behavior is unethical and a little icky and I don’t think I want to work in an environment where that sort of conduct is tolerated.,5,2,64
Holly, It’s not a family.  It’s a workplace.  				,5,2,64
Holly, It’s been a little tense.  People are suspicious of me.  And my best friend in the office won’t even talk to me. Turns out being the morality police does not make you popular.  I should know because in middle school I was the hall monitor and the kids used to stuff egg salad in my locker.  I was just hoping middle school was over.  				,5,2,64
Holly," Yes, that came out during the ethics seminar.",5,2,64
Holly," Oh, I think it is pretty clear that it was unethical.",5,2,64
Holly," Umm, Kendall, I understand that the discount is good for the company but I’m just not happy about the way we are getting it.",5,2,64
Holly," Can I have everyone’s attention?  Excuse me, may I have everyone’s attention, please.  We need to finish the ethics seminar.",5,2,64
Holly," Everyone, please, I just need your signatures to show corporate that I gave you the training.",5,2,64
Holly," In this next section we examine the difference between sick days and personal days.  Sick days are only to be used when an illness precludes you form doing your job or can spread to your coworkers.  Personal days, on the other hand, are much more flexible.  				",5,2,64
Holly," Waaa! More paper! Waaa! [she cracks herself up but Jan is unimpressed]  No, she’s just on a coffee break.",5,3,65
Holly," Oh, that would be great. You need that.",5,4,66
Holly," Um, tonight, I’m free tonight. Is that too eager? [laughs] ",5,4,66
Holly," [gasps] Oh, I just remembered, I can’t tonight.",5,4,66
Holly, We could go to the food court and get different foods. You could get Chicken Teriyaki. I could get a hot dog.,5,4,66
Holly," [walking out of the building] Oh, I forgot my keys.",5,4,66
Holly," Oh, after vous. [walking into the girls bathroom]",5,4,66
Holly," I didn’t forget my keys, I just didn’t want to make out with you in front of the cameras. Do you think they can hear us?",5,4,66
Holly," That wasn’t us, right? I mean… you remembered to lock the doors?",5,4,66
Holly, How’s everyone doing? My door is always open if anyone wants to talk.,5,4,66
Holly, Michael scored the big ticket item.  Springsteen tickets! The boss scored the boss.,5,4,66
Holly," The Springsteen tickets seemed too good to be true. But, a lot of Michael seems too good to be true. So far it’s all true. But yeah, those tickets, really seemed too good to be true.  				",5,4,66
Holly," Oh, look at all this stuff! It’s only seven hours.  				",5,5,67
Holly, Michael is taking a personal day to move me up.,5,5,67
Holly," It’s been a weird week since we found out I had to transfer. Michael wanted me to quit and get some job here in Scranton, and I said “Well, why don’t you quit and get some job in Nashua?” And he said “I asked you first.”  And I said “First!” at the same time he did. And then I said “Jinx.” And then we never talked about it again and haven’t been back to the conversation. So…  				",5,5,67
Holly, I have to unpack this weekend but maybe next weekend we go to the outlets!,5,5,67
Holly, You were sleeping?  You were talking before.,5,5,67
Holly," No, Darryl did not touch me. Can we just keep going, please? [crying]  				",5,5,67
Holly, Michael we’ve only been dating each other for a few weeks,5,5,67
Holly, Michael. Don’t. Don’t. Don’t make it harder than it has to be.,5,5,67
Holly," If you leave on Friday, by five, you’ll be rolling in at… midnight? At best?",5,5,67
Holly, And then sleep in Saturday. That only leaves us less than 24 hours before you have to go back again.,5,5,67
Holly, Years?  Of just a few hours every weekend?,5,5,67
Holly," I am calling because, there’s a terrible crash!",7,4,109
Holly," Three nuns, [Michael laughs] from a Missionary in South Africa.",7,4,109
Holly," [sternly] Michael, I have been dating A.J. for a year and a half now. You do this you know.",7,4,109
Holly," Michael, you cried at that tagline for a movie you made up.",7,4,109
Holly, You made ourselves to be more than we were.,7,4,109
Holly," I don’t know what you’re getting so upset about, we had to break up a long time ago, it was a good memory.",7,4,109
Holly," [on answering machine] This is Holly Flax, I can’t come to the phone right now but please leave a message after the sound of the tiny truck backing up. [BEEP]",7,4,109
Holly," Is there any way I can get a hand with these, please?",7,11,116
Holly," [weak Clint Eastwood accent] Well, well, well, if it isn’t Michael Scott. You old bastard.",7,11,116
Holly," Well I did show my face around these parts, you old bastard.",7,11,116
Holly," [as Marge] Oh, Homey. [they both laugh]",7,11,116
Holly," Oh, yeah. I brought um, some maple candy. But I have to admit, I got a little hungry on the drive, and I ate some of them.",7,11,116
Holly," Oh, it’s so nice to be back. It looks beautiful in here. Super classy. It’s like a party for limousine drivers.",7,11,116
Holly," Oh, it’s fabulous. I love what you did.",7,11,116
Holly, [in the same accent] Watch out for my guns they’re both loaded. [makes gun noises],7,11,116
Holly, That is a really good point. AJ said he hadn’t seen any of the Toy Story movies.,7,11,116
Holly," No. I know. I was like, “What? Are you serious?”",7,11,116
Holly, We sat down and we watched them all in one day. ,7,11,116
Holly, Now he’s the biggest Toy Story fanatic ever.,7,11,116
Holly," He had a little note pinned to him that said, “You’ve got a friend in me.”",7,11,116
Holly," Oh, I want kids. I really want kids. But AJ and I are practically engaged. We talk about spending our lives together.",7,11,116
Holly," Okay, listen, I’m gonna tell him that if he doesn’t propose by the end of this year, we’re over.",7,11,116
Holly," You guys, this has to stop. Someone could have really gotten hurt.",7,11,116
Holly," Dwight’s right. What you did was dangerous and inappropriate. I’m really surprised at you guys. Last time I was here, you were both best friends.",7,11,116
Holly," [walks in with a dirty Woody] Who did this? It’s obvious to me I’m not welcome here, but somebody better tell me who did this, or else I’m leaving.",7,11,116
Holly," Michael, you have to let this go. I’m with someone else. I don’t feel that way anymore.",7,11,116
Holly, You made up a fake girlfriend to see if I’d get jealous? And you destroyed a gift my boyfriend gave me? What is the matter with you?,7,11,116
Holly," Oh, I think everyone’s on edge because of the strangler trial.",7,11,116
Holly," Hey, I’m so glad you came down. It’s been so much harder than I expected.",7,11,116
Holly," Oh, okay, get ready for this. You’re not gonna believe it. I was making salad, and he fell right into the dressing. I mean, there was salad dressing all over him.",7,11,116
Holly," Oh, I get it. Everybody knows about the ultimatum.",7,12,117
Holly," [sticking both ring fingers up] Ha ha, ha ha! ",7,12,117
Holly, I got it for Christmas. I’m so out of my league here.,7,12,117
Holly, [imitating E.T.] Holly misses old phone.,7,12,117
Holly, [imitating E.T.] New phone is confusing. Gets bad reception. ,7,12,117
Holly," [reaches for her cell phone] Oh, I should get this. Hey! Oh, no, don’t go see that one, I want to see that together. Yeah, go see that action one. Okay. I love you, too. All right.  				",7,12,117
Holly," Oh, sure. Have a seat. How were your breaks?",7,12,117
Holly," Nothing really happened. I mean, I know I made a big deal about this whole New Year’s deadline, but um, it came and went… and, we’re still together.",7,12,117
Holly, It just wasn’t fair of me to give him an ultimatum in the first place. The whole thing is totally my fault. But we’re going to be just fine. Just fine.  				,7,12,117
Holly," Oh, no, Michael, I don’t want to talk about it with you. I mean, I’m fine, I just… I don’t want to talk about it.  				",7,12,117
Holly, We’re gonna be just fine. You know how you say something over and over and the words start to sound weird? Going to be just fine… just fine… just fine… just fine…  				,7,12,117
Holly," I just think we need to cool things down for awhile.  Yeah, a break. At least until I get back to Nashua. Yeah, I’m sure.  				",7,12,117
Holly," Oh, I don’t know, Michael. I’m not feeling up to that. ",7,13,118
Holly, Maybe Mikanos ran away to join the Italian circus. ,7,13,118
Holly, We have to try this out on somebody.   ,7,13,118
Holly, [with accent] It’s a very strong coffee with milk from a goat. ,7,13,118
Holly, Why is it such a certainty that we are supposed to be together?,7,14,119
Holly," Michael, I can’t keep getting into a situation where I date whoever I’m working with. Well, you can understand that. ",7,14,119
Holly, Oh really? You don’t think he walked by the bakery just for the smell of it?,7,14,119
Holly," Oh, just changing my cell phone plan. Okay. Okay. Here you go.  I’ll take my free stress ball too now. ",7,14,119
Holly, What? No. Dwight asked if I wanted an egg roll. What… what are you implying?,7,14,119
Holly," Will you stop! There has been a few coincidences, that’s all. ",7,14,119
Holly," Stop looking at me like that. Okay, let’s just go up somewhere high and see if we could spot him on the street below. ",7,14,119
Holly," Look, I’m not playing. I’m gonna go look for him. ",7,14,119
Holly, [walks to the roof of a building and spots Michael] Michael? ,7,14,119
Holly," Okay, bye. Okay, bye. [kisses Michael] I’ll miss you. ",7,15,120
Holly, I cannot keep myself from Michael. Everything he does is sexy. He has this undeniable animal magnetism. He’s a jungle cat. The man exudes sex. He can put both his legs behind his head.   				,7,15,120
Holly, Sorry to interrupt. Forgot to collect my things. ,7,15,120
Holly," Oh, no. Michael, I don’t want to make people uncomfortable. ",7,15,120
Holly," Yeah, but if they’re uncomfortable, it makes me uncomfortable. ",7,15,120
Holly," Wait, wait, wait, what do you mean you love me? We’ve only been dating for a week. Do you mean you love me like, “oh, hey, there’s Holly. I love that girl.” Or you do you mean you love me like you love me-love me?",7,15,120
Holly," Wow, you love me-love me. I love you-love you. [both laugh]",7,15,120
Holly, Give me all your money and take off your clothes. ,7,15,120
Holly, Come one. Nobody’s looking. What’s wrong? ,7,15,120
Holly, Maybe we didn’t want to think about it. We can make it work. We’ll date long-distance. ,7,15,120
Holly, I’m not saying it won’t be hard. But we can make it work. That’s what she said. ,7,15,120
Holly," No, we’re gonna talk now. You’re not breaking up with me. ",7,15,120
Holly," The company. Nobody knows our future, but it’s not gonna be decided by the company. It’s not gonna be decided by anybody but us. What we are is up to you and me. ",7,15,120
Holly, [imitates a squeaky bed] [laughter]  				,7,15,120
Holly," Uhm, I loved that you got to work together with all your friends. Isn’t that great when you can all work together like that?  ",7,16,121
Holly, Wha- It’s your dream and you never even mentioned it before!,7,16,121
Holly, Well why do you have to make a movie at all?,7,16,121
Holly," Really, you can’t think of anything else that you might have?",7,16,121
Holly, [walks into conference room with Michael and Todd] Hi!,7,17,122
Holly, [laughs oddly] Very funny. Okay let’s get started.,7,17,122
Holly," [to Todd] Michael loves you, and your sales speak for themselves.",7,17,122
Holly," Yes I did, I think Todd’s gonna make a great addition to the staff.",7,17,122
Holly," Michael’s recommendation was glowing! And, honestly, he’s been nothing but nice to me!",7,17,122
Holly," Okay, look. We can’t fire someone because we don’t like him.",7,17,122
Holly, Do any of you have any concrete complaints about something he’s done?,7,17,122
Holly," Well if that’s the case, I guess I’ve gotta be fired too. [all groan in disgust]  				",7,17,122
Holly," So, Todd, this must be nice for you getting off the road. You get to spend some time with your daughter.",7,17,122
Holly, So much happening. [not as excited as Michael],7,17,122
Holly," No, what I’m saying is, he’s not funny, but you’re funnier than he is.",7,17,122
Holly, You know we don’t have to sell that if you don’t want to. If it’s a problem with the neon I can have my neon guy take a look.,7,18,123
Holly, Well we could put it in storage… in case.,7,18,123
Holly, You know… in case if something changes.,7,18,123
Holly," Um, I think I know. But I’ll sound stupid if I’m wrong but is Dad there?",7,18,123
Holly," I… I’m not there Dad, I’m in Pennsylvania.",7,18,123
Holly," I live here. Um, can I talk to you about Michael?",7,18,123
Holly," Mom, Dad can’t seem to focus on a subject.",7,18,123
Holly, I think I need to go home to Colorado. My dad isn’t doing so well.,7,18,123
Holly," Yeah, yeah it’s just you know I don’t want to go home when he’s on his death bed you know, I wanna be there when he’s still my dad.",7,18,123
Holly, And I want you to come with me. Now I know that’s a lot to ask of a boyfriend..,7,18,123
Holly, And I was thinking… you know maybe since given our last conversation that we’re both ready… Michael Scott will you..,7,18,123
Holly, It was wrong to put you in that position and… Michael you are my life now. I’m not going to Colorado.,7,18,123
Holly, [everyone in the office is standing in the kitchen with a lit candle] Hi guys.,7,18,123
Holly," Your wife becoming me will I. [everyone in the kitchen starts cheering, then enters annex]",7,18,123
Holly, Boulder. Is something wrong? Are you okay?,7,21,126
Holly," [deep man voice] I’ll pay the rent! [Michael laughs] Okay, my mom’s looking at me and she has no sense of humor. It’s a joke mom!",7,21,126
Holly, Well I’ll see you tonight. I’ll pick you up outside baggage claim.,7,21,126
Stanley," You can’t say for sure whether it’ll be us or them, can you?",1,1,1
Stanley, I admire your culture’s success in America.,1,2,2
Stanley," There’s no dental, there’s no vision, there’s a $1,200 deductible.  				",1,3,3
Stanley," [looks at keys, continues talking on phone] …the light green or green…  				",1,3,3
Stanley," This isn’t the big surprise, is it? Because we’ve been having a pretty horrible day.",1,3,3
Stanley, We all think you don’t have a surprise.,1,3,3
Stanley, Is that from the machine that was in your office? ,1,6,6
Stanley, I thought that was the incentive prize for the top salesperson. ,1,6,6
Stanley," I don’t know where they are, I think I threw them out.",2,1,8
Stanley," Say, we got to order some more apa-teezers this time.  We ran out last year, remember?",2,1,8
Stanley, It’s this person who’s hand I’m holding Michael.,2,1,8
Stanley," Well, well, last year, I got great work, so I don’t…",2,1,8
Stanley," So, I don’t know what to think about this award. But at least I didn’t get smelliest bowel movement like Kevin. [starts chuckling]  					",2,1,8
Stanley, That is my daughter. She goes to Catholic girls’ school. I am taking it down right now. ,2,2,9
Stanley," Yeah, I got a game. It’s called “work hard so my kids can go to college.” ",2,3,10
Stanley, A little bit more and I would have had it.  					,2,3,10
Stanley, That’s one book. You’ve got two others. ,2,4,11
Stanley," Come on people, you know the rules of the game now. ",2,4,11
Stanley," [laughs, and imitates Donald Trump] You’re fired. Get your fingers off my phone.  				",2,5,12
Stanley, I don’t want to stay until seven again this year.,2,6,13
Stanley," Michael, can’t your conversation wait till Monday.",2,6,13
Stanley, Sometimes women say more in their pauses than they say in their words.,2,8,15
Stanley," Oh, yes.  Let’s listen to it again.  And this time, really listen to the pauses.",2,8,15
Stanley," Oh, no, that’s ok.  I did learn it on the streets.  On the ghetto, in fact.",2,8,15
Stanley, I didn’t think the premium laser color copy batch would sell as well as it did.,2,9,16
Stanley, [after Ryan opens a new gift – a nameplate saying ‘Kelly’] That was meant for Kelly.,2,10,17
Stanley, And you should have just bought a $20 gift like everyone else.,2,10,17
Stanley, Should my wife tell her boss she’s not coming in tomorrow?,2,11,18
Stanley," [on phone] Excuse me one second, please. [to Michael] What is it that you need right now that you can’t wait until I’m off the phone with a customer?",2,14,21
Stanley, This here is a run-out-the-clock situation. Just like upstairs.  				,2,15,22
Stanley, Go ahead. Get the wallpaper. Wallpaper the ceiling if you want. Call Terri and tell her she… ,2,17,24
Stanley," Michael, you remember my daughter, Melissa. ",2,18,25
Stanley," That little girl is a child! I don’t want to see you sniffing around her anymore this afternoon, do you understand?!",2,18,25
Stanley," Boy have you lost your mind? ‘Cause I’ll help you find it! Whatcha lookin’ for, ain’t nobody gonna help you out there! Jesus could come through that door and he’s not gonna help you if you don’t stop sniffing after my child! ",2,18,25
Stanley, Is this trip related in any way to your… birthday? ,2,19,26
Stanley," No, I don’t. I have a glass of red wine with dinner about once a week.  For the antioxidants. ",2,20,27
Stanley," Wednesdays, tearful. Tuesdays… [Dwight walks in and rummages through his complaint box]",2,21,28
Stanley, [Under his breath] Will Lady Fortune give me a raise?,2,22,29
Stanley,"  I got them a toaster.  They called off the wedding and gave the toaster back to me.  I tried to return the toaster to the store, and they said they no longer sold that kind of toaster.  So now my house has got two toasters.  					",3,1,31
Stanley," If you do that, you’re going to have to put out.",3,2,32
Stanley, How does that qualify him to run a branch?,3,3,33
Stanley, [standing at the supply shelf] I’m on the phone.,3,3,33
Stanley," I wake up every morning in a bed that’s too small, drive my daughter to a school that’s too expensive, and then I go to work to a job for which I get paid too little, but on Pretzel Day? Well, I like pretzel day.   ",3,5,35
Stanley," Three hundred and sixty four days, ’till the next Pretzel Day.   ",3,5,35
Stanley, I couldn’t be happier. I’m gonna take the severance and retire. My wife and I are gonna travel. [chuckles] I really couldn’t be happier.  				,3,7,37
Stanley, I don’t know who these new people think they are. I’ve sat downwind of Phyllis’ stinky perfumes for years. Never said a word.  ,3,8,38
Stanley, Back to work. We don’t have to get along. We just have to work together.,3,8,38
Stanley, My bonus check was a hundred dollars less than you promised.,3,11,41
Stanley, I am not doing a lick more work until I get my full bonus check.,3,11,41
Stanley, Mind? Nothing would delight me more.  				,3,12,42
Stanley, So good to see you too. I’d like you fellas to meet Ryan Howard. ,3,12,42
Stanley, I’m gonna let Ryan do a little pitch for you while I do my crossword. Ryan?,3,12,42
Stanley," Ha ha ha! And you just said, “Hi! Hi! Hi!” Ha heh ha! You sounded like my niece, and she’s six months old!   				",3,12,42
Stanley, You must have been scared out of your mind.,3,18,48
Stanley," Yeah, I heard how much Michael makes.  I still think he’s way overpaid.  				",3,18,48
Stanley, So you and Bob are looking at a historical house?,3,18,48
Stanley, [on phone] I am upset.  Don’t I sound upset?,3,20,50
Stanley," No [crosses arms], the blue team.   				",3,22,52
Stanley," There’s already a twist, you’re carrying an egg on a spoon.",3,22,52
Stanley, Thank you so much.  [Stanley sits down and pulls out his crossword puzzle],3,22,52
Stanley, Do you expect me to believe that you’re truly making your recommendations on this basis? ,3,22,52
Stanley, I would rather work for an upturned broom with a bucket for a head than work for somebody else in this office besides myself. Game on!  				,3,22,52
Stanley, [to Jim] Sorry about that. It’s all about taking points away from Dwight. ,3,22,52
Stanley," How so? I mean… sure thing, that sounds smart… I can’t do this anymore! I’m goin’ to sit in the bus. ",3,22,52
Stanley, I’ve never heard you talk that much. I thought it was Kelly. ,3,23,53
Stanley," No.  In fact, I’ll give you a billion Stanley Nickels if you never talk to me again.",3,23,53
Stanley, The same as the ratio of unicorns to leprechauns.,3,23,53
Stanley, What is wrong with you? Why did you have to phrase it like that?,4,1,55
Stanley, You can’t be serious. You ran a woman over this morning.,4,1,55
Stanley," [on the phone] No, rabies… Babies would be a good idea. Can I put you down for a dime?",4,1,55
Stanley, Oh yes I will work out today. I will work out a way to avoid running for a stupid cause.  				,4,1,55
Stanley," If the kid wants to set mine up, I’ll let him.",4,2,56
Stanley,  You said you weren’t coming back and we could leave early.,4,3,57
Stanley," Michael, I know that’s you. Why are you calling me here at home?",4,4,58
Stanley," Michael, I know that’s you. I know your voice. Why are you calling me here at home? [Michael hands up]  ",4,4,58
Stanley," [on the phone] When I’m at home at night in my own house in my sweats drinking some red wine watching my mystery stories, the last thing in the whole God forsaken world I want to hear is the voice of Michael Scott.  ",4,4,58
Stanley, I bet it’s Jan spending him straight to the poor house.,4,4,58
Stanley, Urban? I grew up in a small town. What about me seems urban to you?,4,5,59
Stanley, I don’t understand why sleeping at your desk is better than you not being here.,4,6,60
Stanley," I got an offer from Utica for more money, and I’m going to take it.",4,6,60
Stanley, I think it’s because of my sales record.,4,6,60
Stanley," I changed my mind, I wanna keep this job.",4,6,60
Stanley," I wasn’t really planning on leaving, all I wanted was a raise.  How on Earth did Michael call my bluff?  Is he some sort of secret genius? [laughs] Sometimes I say crazy things.  				",4,6,60
Stanley," I took an extra shot of insulin in preparation for this cake today. If I don’t have some cake soon, I might die.",4,7,61
Stanley,"  Oh, I forgot something in my car. I’ll see you guys up there. [takes the stairs after the elevator doors close]  				",5,1,63
Stanley,"  I happen to be losing weight on my own for my own reasons. The truth is, I have lost a little of my speed, a little of my fire. Here’s what I used to look like. [holds up old photo] Look at those biceps. We were fighting the power and eating whatever we wanted.  				",5,1,63
Stanley,"  I lost four pounds. I don’t know what those other fools were doing, but I lost four pounds.  				",5,1,63
Stanley,  Tastes changed. Now all I like is baklava.  				,5,1,63
Stanley,  I don’t know about anyone else.  But it was a good summer for me.  I lost seven pounds.  And you know what?  I’m just gonna take five days off anyway.  				,5,1,63
Stanley, It’s a quarter to five and I have started to gather my things.,5,2,64
Stanley, Amen.  Just keep the ribs coming.   				,5,2,64
Stanley," I do not like pregnant women in my workspace.  They’re always complaining.  I have varicose veins, too.  I have swollen ankles, I’m constantly hungry – do you think my nipples don’t get sore too?  Do you think I don’t need to know the fastest way to the hospital?  				",5,3,65
Stanley, Heh heh. [Jim gives camera an odd look]  				,5,7,69
Stanley, I will not be the big guy in the tiny hat. [Kevin is wearing the same hat]  				,5,10,72
Stanley," What difference does it make? Attractive, beautiful, hot, we’re talking about the same thing here.",5,12,74
Stanley," I am trying to be more optimistic in life. I’ve got what, 20 or 30 years left. And my family history says I have less. Now, the old Stanley Hudson would have found something wrong this actress. But that is no way to live life. Look at this healthy sexy pretty strong young woman. C’mon people! She is hot.   ",5,12,74
Stanley," It’s true. Around this office, in the past, I have been a little abrupt with people…   				",5,13,75
Stanley, [flashback] Are you from another planet?,5,13,75
Stanley," [flashback] Boy, have you lost your mind? ‘Cause I’ll help you find it.",5,13,75
Stanley, But the doctor said if I can’t find a new way to relate more positively to my surroundings I’m going to die.  				,5,13,75
Stanley," Yes. I had a heart attack.  I would quit, but I’m too old to find another job and I don’t have enough saved to retire.  I feel like I’m working in my own casket.  				",5,13,75
Stanley, I’m not feeling well.  I need to sit down. ,5,13,75
Stanley, It alerts me when my stress level goes up so I can try to calm down.,5,13,75
Stanley, That’s better. [Michael walks back towards Stanley and the beeping goes up again],5,13,75
Stanley, [laughs] You don’t have to lie. Through here.,5,14,76
Stanley, We’re not friends. I didn’t think about it.,5,14,76
Stanley, [thinks for a moment] Give me two clients for her.  				,5,14,76
Stanley," I have to take care of a couple things. So Andy will be taking over things here. You’re in good hands, and give my best to your mother.",5,14,76
Stanley," Take a nap, nothing good is on TV right now.",5,15,77
Stanley," Pardon me, may I have a chocolate chip cookie?  I gave blood earlier and I’m still feeling woozy.",5,16,78
Stanley," [backing out of the bloodmobile] I, uh-oh I feel so woozy I just [to Phyllis] Band-Aids.",5,16,78
Stanley, I’ve got a golden ticket idea. Why don’t you skip on up to the roof and jump off?,5,17,79
Stanley, I’m meeting a client. Do you have a problem with that?,6,1,81
Stanley," [as Michael gets in car] That is ridiculous. Of course not, why would you think that?",6,1,81
Stanley, [hits steering wheel angrily] Damn! I told her it was a stupid idea to go up in that club. ,6,1,81
Stanley, It’s just that… Teri’s been traveling a lot… ,6,1,81
Stanley," Cynthia’s been keeping me company. She was my nurse, when I was in rehabilitation. We used to go on these long walks on the treadmill… I didn’t… ",6,1,81
Stanley," Yeah, but Michael, I’m going to go break it off. That’s where I’m headed right now. I swear.",6,1,81
Stanley," I just need you to promise not to say a word about this to anyone. Michael, please.",6,1,81
Stanley, [pissed off] You told everyone I was having an affair?,6,1,81
Stanley," “If you don’t smell this, you’re fired.”",6,3,83
Stanley, We just need to hear your plan for our raise. ,6,3,83
Stanley, Are you crazy? I brought Cynthia with me.,6,4,84
Stanley," A queen size bed is five feet wide. I am not five feet wide, Michael.",6,4,84
Stanley,  If your hat hits me in the face one more time–,6,4,84
Stanley,  Anyone have anything they want to trade for a toaster?  ,6,4,84
Stanley,"  Oh lord, we’re all gonna lose our jobs.",6,9,89
Stanley,"  This is ridiculous. [gets up to leave, as does Angela]",6,9,89
Stanley, I thought you were killed by Polluticorn.,6,10,90
Stanley, [shows newspaper article and reads] “Local businessman pledges college tuition to third graders”  				,6,11,91
Stanley, We’re supposed to applaud you for taking a giant diaper off fake tree?,6,12,92
Stanley," Well, unless the missing piece is a gun, you don’t have a gun.",6,12,92
Stanley,  Why do you find someone for yourself instead of meddling in our affairs?,6,16,96
Stanley," We need those leads, Michael. It’s our job Michael. Michael!  				",6,18,98
Stanley," If we act nice now, then we’re rewarding them for treating us poorly.",6,18,98
Stanley," [enters room] Well, you better be happy, taking two percent of our – ",6,18,98
Stanley, [beams] This is – nice! [pats Oscar’s shoulder] All of us back together.  				,6,18,98
Stanley," Dwight, I know these programs. “Every color is important because, together, we make a rainbow.”",6,21,101
Stanley, I’ll slap you in the face with a rainbow. ,6,21,101
Stanley, My doctor told me to cut out hot dogs. We all got problems.  				,6,22,102
Stanley,  How about make-believe land has anything you want?,6,23,103
Stanley,"  Oh, Michael, will you drop it? Everybody’s spoken their mind, and no one’s changing their mind.",6,23,103
Stanley," [quietly] Phyllis, what’s this guy’s name again?",6,24,104
Stanley, Let’s just make this kid open this damn car.,7,1,106
Stanley,"  How many paper supplies and ink cartridges to go with that? Ok, sure. ",7,2,107
Stanley, Interesting subject matter. I’m surprised you pulled it off.,7,3,108
Stanley, You’re always asking for our attention.,7,4,109
Stanley," [agreement around the office] That’s what I was thinking, you kept announcing scores.",7,4,109
Stanley, I would like to stay. This pertains to me.,7,5,110
Stanley, Why do you always assume I have diabetes?,7,5,110
Stanley, Hmmm. [glances at Andy] Thank you.  				,7,6,111
Stanley," [looks at the clock, then at his watch] Hold up! That clock is slow. It is five o’clock, I will see you all tomorrow:",7,6,111
Stanley, How many freakin’ vampires am I supposed to care about these days?  				,7,6,111
Stanley, [walking down the runway] Raaah! [waves sword]  				,7,6,111
Stanley, This is not the meal I was promised. I’m going to have no energy for the rest of the day.,7,7,112
Stanley, I would run to Mexico if that’s where the sandwiches are.,7,7,112
Stanley," Yes, I have a dream. And It’s not some M.L.K. Dream for Equality. I want to own a decommissioned Lighthouse. And I want to live at the top. And nobody knows I live there. And there’s a button that I can press, and it’ll launch that lighthouse into space.   ",7,9,114
Stanley," Dwight, why is the toilet paper only half a ply?",7,10,115
Stanley," Are you just gonna sit there, Office Administrator, or are you going to do something?",7,10,115
Stanley, [cheerily] Pam got those sugar-free cookies I like. I’m doing fine.,7,11,116
Stanley," Yeah, who’s a little girl now? [everyone laughs]",7,11,116
Stanley," So do they bring in food, or do you get to go out?",7,11,116
Stanley," I have been trying to get on jury duty every single year since I was 18 years old. To get to go sit in an air-conditioned room downtown, judging people while my lunch is paid for… that is the life.  				",7,11,116
Stanley," Woman, you’ve had a computer for years!",7,14,119
Stanley, So something good happening to Stanley is crazy now?,7,17,122
Stanley," Deangelo, you’re going to starve to death. [laughter] ",7,19,124
Stanley, What are you doing? Have you lost your mind?,7,19,124
Stanley, Have you lost your mind! Get off my property before I call the police!,7,20,125
Stanley," Where’s the rest of it, it’s got no balls.",7,21,126
Stanley," [as Michael walks away, Stanley whispers angrily to Andy] Gimme those clients!",7,21,126
Stanley, [refills his coffee near a sign that reads “Honor System:,7,23,128
Stanley,"  [in elevator with Phyllis and Darryl, all three are smiling, to Darryl] Good morning.",7,24,129
Stanley,"  The hell you will! I worked for the last boss for 15 years. According to my doctor, I don’t have another 15 years if I want to keep up the same dietary and sexual lifestyle, which I intend to.",7,24,129
Stanley,"  My next boss will be my last boss. He’ll be at my funeral. So I would appreciate it if you would take this seriously. [dunks his half-eaten donut in Jim’s coffee, takes it back out, and leaves]",7,24,129
Deangelo, I’ll drink to that. I’m starting at a company this week.,7,19,124
Deangelo, Well that’s just good sense right there. Everyone I know who skis is dead.,7,19,124
Deangelo," Try it once, you’re hooked. That’s my guess.",7,19,124
Deangelo," [holds out fist] Knuckles! Actually, I gotta come around and give you…  				",7,19,124
Deangelo," You know, it’s funny, I tried to get an animal olympics going.",7,19,124
Deangelo," You know, life happened. What are you gonna miss most about Scranton?",7,19,124
Deangelo, I’m at the bar. The bar that’s located in the lobby of the hotel.,7,19,124
Deangelo," I hear your voice, I see your lips moving.",7,19,124
Deangelo," That is insane, that is the right term. Let’s get some Vodka up in this cranberry, and one for my friend.  				",7,19,124
Deangelo," Oh, she’ll do. She’ll do just fine.  				",7,19,124
Deangelo," I am very much looking forward to tommorow. It feels like the culmanation of a lot of hard work, a lot of good fortune…",7,19,124
Deangelo, Did that? Did that just happen?! [runs after Michael] We should.. we should write a movie or something! I’m serious!  				,7,19,124
Deangelo," Can I just say, I am so excited to be working here. Little bit about myself, I love the American Southwest, for starters. You may call them Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah, I call them heaven. I have a peanut allergy, something I live with, it’s a part of me. I’ve learned to cope with it. What else, I’m just as comfortable at the ball game as I am at the opera. I was a-  				",7,19,124
Deangelo," No, not officially, actually, I saw you walking out of the bathroom before.",7,19,124
Deangelo, [offers Kelly the papers as she walks away]  				,7,19,124
Deangelo," Oh. [chuckles] That was… let’s see, where’s my replacement? Where’s the guy I’m replacing? Why don’t I look to the left? He’s sitting right there! [office laughs]",7,19,124
Deangelo, [laughs] Office funny guy! Always glad to have an office funny guy around!  				,7,19,124
Deangelo," Well, congratulations. I have four kids of my own.",7,19,124
Deangelo, I do a lot of portion control. I try to keep my daily calor intake under 1200. [laughter],7,19,124
Deangelo, Here’s the great thing about the southwest; there’s so much more than desert. Along the north rim of the Grand Canyon is a forest as lush as you’ve ever seen. ,7,19,124
Deangelo," Sounds very interesting, thank you.  				",7,19,124
Deangelo, Why do you use your name when you use the phone?,7,19,124
Deangelo, I just prefer it without the name and I thought- I’ve got to start doing some managing at some point.,7,19,124
Deangelo," Hey, funny guy. Wanna have a little mid-day lawl here. Make me laugh, huh? What you got? I can’t even look at you.",7,19,124
Deangelo," Oh, yeah. Put a pin on that, kid. Can’t wait to hear the punchline.",7,19,124
Deangelo, I saw a hawk today. Just sitting right there on the overpass. Looking at me.,7,19,124
Deangelo," Ok, alright! I love it! I love it! Michael, this is Reggie. He is the #1 yelp reviewed shaver in Scranton. It’s not even close.",7,19,124
Deangelo," Alright. This is how we do it. Feels nice, doesn’t it?",7,19,124
Deangelo," Ah, yes, please! Just cozy up there. Just thought we could have some rap sessions with smaller groups.",7,19,124
Deangelo," You know what, enough about your baby, ok? I’m sorry.",7,19,124
Deangelo," No, no, no, I know what you’re doing. Just quit it. I want to hear from the rank and file. How can I be the best manager for you all? What can I do better?",7,19,124
Deangelo," Let’s not talk politics in the office, ok? I like you better as a funny guy.",7,19,124
Deangelo, [laughter] Now that’s funny! That’s funny! You walk much?,7,19,124
Deangelo," Thank you. That’s my stuff. Yeah. Michael, take a look at this.",7,19,124
Deangelo," Oh, that’d be great, thank you Stanley!",7,19,124
Deangelo," Yep, ten-gallon hat. Technically, it only holds about three quartz. Little factoid.",7,19,124
Deangelo," Hey, funny man! Whatcha got for me? Make me laugh?",7,19,124
Deangelo, I need a wide berth. I need a wide berth from those nuts.,7,19,124
Deangelo," Michael, the last time I was exposed to a peanut, I was itchy for three days, ok? I had to take baths constantly. I missed the O.J. verdict. I had to read about it in the paper like an idiot.",7,19,124
Deangelo," No, Jim, not everything is life or death. I want to feel comfortable.",7,19,124
Deangelo, [uses book to stop the sandwitch’s flight] You’re getting nut particles all in the air!,7,19,124
Deangelo," [steps into conference room] Everyone, mandatory meeting. Multi-purpose room, now.  ",7,19,124
Deangelo," [walks out] Hold on, Hey Michael, Michael, wait up, hold on. Um, so for these meetings do you just jump into business or do you start with some chit-chat or…?",7,19,124
Deangelo," Maybe. Maybe not. 50/50. You know what, it is too bad for this place that you’re leaving. [extents hands for hug] Bring it in, come on. [Michael doesn’t accept hug] Ok. [walks back]",7,19,124
Deangelo, I… I’m adequete. I’m half as good as you.,7,19,124
Deangelo," Will you do me a favour and enjoy this time, ok? You’ve worked so hard, get your senioritis on. It’s Lake Havasu time!",7,19,124
Deangelo, Ok. What is the Native American girl’s name?,7,19,124
Deangelo, That’s a cute baby. Very cute baby. Adorable. Very cute.,7,19,124
Deangelo," I swear, that baby could be the star of a show entitled ‘Babys I Don’t Care About.’  				",7,19,124
Deangelo," Well, you know, why don’t we try it, and if it goes good it’ll be part of my tradition.",7,20,125
Deangelo, Do you usually leave your door unlocked? And ajar?,7,20,125
Deangelo," Thank you Michael, uh, but I will have to pass.",7,20,125
Deangelo," Not much of a performer, unless you count singing in the shower. Boy, okay…",7,20,125
Deangelo," [whispers to Michael] Michael, I’m very, very bad.",7,20,125
Deangelo," That is true, we do share some similarities. I know how you can fix one of those problems, for me it was portion control. For you, you need a key chain. Maybe one with a-",7,20,125
Deangelo," Uhhh, you sir! [points to Jim] Are we having fun tonight?",7,20,125
Deangelo," This is so weird! If I’m conducting a meeting, good to go. But if I think of it as a performance… I-I fall apart. Obviously.",7,20,125
Deangelo," [laying down, Michael is sitting on DeAngelo’s stomach bouncing up and down in Michael’s office] Me mo. Me mo.",7,20,125
Deangelo," When I was very young, my mother divorced my father and I had to go to court and choose between them.",7,20,125
Deangelo," THE DUNDIES ARE-OW-ABOUT COMING TOGETHER! AND RECOGNIZING, THE ADOMINABILITY OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT! [Jim comes and closes the door]",7,20,125
Deangelo, [bad Australian accent attempt] THE DUNDIES!,7,20,125
Deangelo," Ughhh, I gotta find Michael Scott! And then I gotta, [Russel Brand impression] Get Him to the Dundies!",7,20,125
Deangelo," [in the office near the accountants] Hey, can you help me find Michael Scott Angela?",7,20,125
Deangelo, Jim! Do you know where I can find Michael Scott?,7,20,125
Deangelo, No one is listening to me! And I’m running out of time!,7,20,125
Deangelo," Maybe I just need to look into my heart. [in the bathroom in front of the mirror] DeAngelo, where is Michael Scott. [his reflection in the mirror turns around to reveal that it is Michael]",7,20,125
Deangelo," This was not, part of the job description!",7,20,125
Deangelo, Hit me again. [Michael slaps him once more],7,20,125
Deangelo," They say he’s going to be my right hand man, adlib masturbation joke. [realizing he wasn’t supposed to read that directly off the cue card, speaks quietly] No, I hate this, I hate it so much. [loud again] Dwight Schrute! Please accept this promising Assistant Manager Dundie. [people clap as Dwight takes the microphone, he is obviously unenthused] Thank you, thank you so much. I would like to thank something that we, uh, take for granted in our daily lives. And that is the humble trashcan. [Creed nods] This is for you trashcan! [walks off and throws the Dundie into the trashcan]",7,20,125
Deangelo," Hold on, hold on one second. [puts on the headphones and turns the volume up all the way] I WANNA, I WANNA, I FEEL TRULY BLESSED! UHHH, TO BE WORKING WITH ALL OF YOU! BEFORE THIS ALL STARTED, FUNNY STORY, I WAS IN THE BATHROOM, VOMITTING, AND VOMITTING IN THE MEN’S ROOM!",7,20,125
Deangelo, THAT’S WHY IT’S BEEN SHUT DOWN FOR MOST OF THE EVENING…,7,20,125
Deangelo," This is truly special, for me! And uh, anyway. It’s so much lighter!",7,20,125
Deangelo, I know I’m the cause of this royal screw up but I would like to see this show go on.,7,20,125
Deangelo," [with Dwight and Michael outside Michael’s car] You know what, I have to go to the bathroom.",7,20,125
Deangelo, I can just run over to the gas station.,7,20,125
Deangelo," [as Michael pulls over and stops the car] Please don’t stop so suddenly, the seatbelt is pressing on my bladder. Why are you even wearing a seatbelt, you’re sitting in the backseat, baby.",7,20,125
Deangelo," [very uncomfortable] Look, what ever you’re going to do, how long is it going to take? Ballpark. ‘Cause I just, I gotta make a decision here. [gets out and slams the door]",7,20,125
Deangelo," [recall to Dundies at Louie Volpies] Every day, millions of Americans suffer from extreme repulsiveness. Someone in our midst, is bringing that problem to light. Toby Flenderson, please come up here and accept the Extreme Repulsiveness Award. Oh that’s so mean!",7,20,125
Deangelo, [with Michael in his office] You’re not gonna take all these toys are you?,7,21,126
Deangelo," I mean you don’t have a job lined up, so it’s not like you have a desk to put ’em on.",7,21,126
Deangelo," That’s nice. [reaches and a grabs a toy truck] How ’bout that truck? Can I have this little truck? I was thinking I might… glue a stapler on top. Or put a hole here, stick pens in it. [Michael gives an obviously fake smile] You okay?",7,21,126
Deangelo," You know what? Uh, it’s your last couple days, I’m gonna get out of your hair.",7,21,126
Deangelo," I used to be obese. Once you’ve conquered obesity, everything else is easy. Life literally moves in slow motion. I’m not saying I’m superman, but, let me just put it this way. If I were shot in the head, I’m pretty sure everything would be fine. I almost welcome it. [winks]  				",7,21,126
Deangelo," [hurriedly, while hiding the chocolate covered chicken] Hey!",7,21,126
Deangelo," Let’s rip it up homes. [smacks top of the door frame with his hand, leaving a chocolate hand outline]  				",7,21,126
Deangelo," [in car with Andy] okay, so what’s our approach? You a veteran? Do I have a month to live? You gonna get married tomorrow? What? [Andy stares blankly] Hmm?",7,21,126
Deangelo," That’s stupid. [laughing. Nervously, Andy laughs with him]",7,21,126
Deangelo, [still laughing] What do you know? We gotta get psyched up! Okay? Guy? Let’s get psyched! Is there an animal shelter on the way?,7,21,126
Deangelo, Awesome! Ani Ani Shelto! Here we come. Do you know how to high-five?,7,21,126
Deangelo, [at the animal shelter with Andy] You know how I met Jo Bennett? And got started on my ladder of success?,7,21,126
Deangelo," [hands Andy a dog] I’m walking along, out of work. Again. Thinking to myself, ‘I only have enough cash to by a sandwich, or get drunk. And I see this guy trying to steal this lady’s dog! So I grab the dog. He runs off. She’s so grateful, she hires me.",7,21,126
Deangelo, Gimme that dog! That’s not your dog! [takes the dog from a confused Andy] Yeah! Again.,7,21,126
Deangelo, Gimme that damn dog you f***ing thief! Don’t ever do It again! [Andy nods modestly] You hear me?! [Andy nods again] You feel that energy?,7,21,126
Deangelo," [giving his and Andy’s pitch to a client] I would just like to start off saying, I have not worked with Mr. Andy Bernard for very long, I can say, is that he is no Michael Scott. I can’t sit here and tell you he’s gonna be a success. I can’t sit here and tell you that he’s even the best man for the job. [Andy looks awkward] But I can say this:",7,21,126
Deangelo, [walking out the client’s room with Andy] That is cold sir! Absolutely cold. You know what? It was a complete waste of my time.,7,21,126
Deangelo," [on his phone waiting for Andy, next to their car] Yes. Okay, alright. No, well thank you! Alright, take care. [hangs up] You’ll never guess, we did it!",7,21,126
Deangelo," [all are in the conference room for Michael’s party. Michael isn’t there. Jim gives the camera a knowing look] Well if he’s not gonna make it at least we should go ahead and eat the cake. [Kevin nods] I for one love the corners. [cuts a corner piece, picks it up with his bare hands, and takes a bite] Why’d I just do that? It’s not even that good. I don’t even want it. I had cake for lunch. [throws the piece in the garbage] No, you know what? I’ve been good. I deserve this. [grabs a piece from another corner. The office groans] What am I doing? [chucks it into the trashcan] Come on DeAngelo! [DeAngelo tries to lick the cake, everybody yells no]",7,21,126
Deangelo," They are trying to figure me out.  And I don’t like it.  Once they figure me out, they start to tell me what I want to hear.  And I need to quickly figure out who’s a good worker and who is simply a good mind reader.  Because as soon as I’m hearing what I want to hear, I’m not gonna care.  				",7,22,127
Deangelo," Change two, Toby, you’re gettin’ a new chair.",7,22,127
Deangelo," Don’t thank me!  Hey, don’t thank me, guy!  Okay?  And I don’t care if you like it.",7,22,127
Deangelo," I don’t care what your favorite flavor is.  Here’s a bowl of ice cream.  You either like it or you don’t.  [Andy nods] That’s my attitude right now in this room, that’s my attitude on Ice Cream Thursdays.  Alright?  Clear?  Any questions?",7,22,127
Deangelo," That is a s–  astute observation, Kevin.  				",7,22,127
Deangelo," [continuing to talk to Darryl] And if you’re really serious, you should go in the spring.",7,22,127
Deangelo, No.  Because the entire state smells like Earth.,7,22,127
Deangelo, [holding two cups of coffee] There he is!  Got ya coffee.  [offers cup to Dwight],7,22,127
Deangelo, Listen.  I’ve got a sixer.  “Automatic for the People” on the jukebox.  Let’s hit the park after sundown.  Come on!  Pick up some sausage if you want.,7,22,127
Deangelo," No matter how many times I reach out to Dwight, he doesn’t seem to want anything to do with me.  It reminds me of my relationship with my son.  Except there, I’m the Dwight.  				",7,22,127
Deangelo," Who’s the biggest client in the state?  I say we go get ’em, whatever it takes.  Huh?  What do you guys say?  ",7,22,127
Deangelo," Right!  Or my other idea, 50,000 tiny clients.",7,22,127
Deangelo," [shoots mini basketball at hoop on office door, misses badly] Is that ball lighter than usual?  Is that a Chinatown knockoff?  ",7,22,127
Deangelo," No, that’s definitely a knockoff.  You can feel the center of gravity’s off.  Feel that.  [throws ball to Gabe]  What do you think?",7,22,127
Deangelo, [calling for the ball] Deangelo! [shoots and makes it]  See what I did there?  That’s what you need to do.  [makes shooting gesture] It’s that little English.  The British are coming.,7,22,127
Deangelo," Hey Ry.  Your department’s killing it, baby. [puts arm around Ryan]",7,22,127
Deangelo, You know I have a cousin who cracked the secret formula for a certain popular cola that I shall not name.  So I’ve never had to buy it.  True story.  I just drink my cousin’s.,7,22,127
Deangelo," You know what… straight up, why don’t you like me?",7,22,127
Deangelo, Yes.  Yes-yes-yes-yes-yes [starts to run out of the break room] yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes!  				,7,22,127
Deangelo," What’s wrong with juggling, Darryl?  I’m a big juggler.  I actually perform a motivational juggling routine.  ",7,22,127
Deangelo," Oh yeah.  I’d do it for you here, but uh, what would you say this room is, 300 square feet?  320?",7,22,127
Deangelo," It’s a little cramped.  How many square feet out there?  17, 18 hundo?",7,22,127
Deangelo, Sorry gang.  Thought my juggling stuff was in the trunk of my car.  It’s not.,7,22,127
Deangelo," Sorry, I never touch another juggler’s instruments.  You know, we’re all here, I’ve got the music cued, why don’t I just do my routine without the juggling balls? [starts to play “Wake Me Up Inside” by Evanescence] Prepare… to go into the danger zone.  [begins pretend juggling routine]",7,22,127
Deangelo," No.  Never.  Can someone please throw me a fifth ball?  If you dare!  [Kevin pretends to throw ball]  Incoming!  And we’re on!  Remember, nothing’s impossible!  Phyllis, where’s Phyllis?",7,22,127
Deangelo," [pretending to bounce balls off Phyllis at close range]  Feel that connection?  Don’t move your head.  Please.  Thank you.  Oh!  Big hand for Phyllis!  [clapping]  That took a lot of guts!  [finishes routine]  Ho!  I’m Deangelo Vickers, thank you so much, hope you learned something.",7,22,127
Deangelo," Yeah, I got tons of time.  This job’s a joke.  				",7,22,127
Deangelo," Yeah sure.  Let’s make it a meeting. [Darryl, Kevin, Gabe enter office]",7,22,127
Deangelo," What’s the big secret?  Why are you even whispering?  Come on, it’s the guys!",7,22,127
Deangelo," Guys.  Hold on.  Doesn’t matter who, okay?  I’m just happy that Jim brought it to my attention because honestly, I had – I had no idea.",7,22,127
Deangelo," Erin, do you mind running down to the lobby and bringing up my brand new executive assistant?",7,22,127
Deangelo," Oh, I’m glad you asked, Jim.  Because apparently there’s a rumor running around here that I am a sexist.  I can’t work here effectively if you guys think I’m something that I am not.  I am not a sexist.  Raise your hand if you have a vagina.  [Deangelo raises hand, Kelly and Pam sheepishly raise hands] Raise your hand if someone you love has a vagina.  [Deangelo raises other hand, along with rest of office] Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  Just about everyone.  What about Deangelo’s hand?  Oh wow.  He’s got ’em both up.  [Ryan raises both hands]  Yeah.  Uh huh.  [others raise both hands] Yeah, so it bothers me when I hear that there’s gossip around here that I treat women lesser than men.  Okay?  Frankly, we all look a little ridiculous when that happens.",7,22,127
Deangelo," Man, you’re smart.  [Erin arrives with new executive assistant]  Oh, hey!  Hi!  Hello.  Welcome.  Uh, everyone, I’d like you to please welcome Jordan Garfield.  This is everyone.",7,22,127
Deangelo, No corporate experience whatsoever.  I didn’t want anyone with any bad habits.  				,7,22,127
Deangelo," Internally, for office use [Jim quietly enters Deangelo’s office and sits down] where do we get our paper from?  Do we go –",7,22,127
Deangelo," Okay, I don’t have time for this he said-she said.",7,22,127
Deangelo, It’s too murky.  I like Ryan.  You seem kind of hysterical to me.  Ryan’s your supervisor.  Let’s just leave it that way.,7,22,127
Deangelo," [chuckles] Oh, you mean Michael Jordan?",7,22,127
Deangelo, I’m no MJ.  I can do his dunk.  From the free throw line.,7,22,127
Deangelo," Okay.  We’ll keep that in mind.  Alright, ladies, back to the game.",7,22,127

Deangelo," Yeah, come on.  I’ll dunk over you.  Best seat in the house.",7,22,127
Deangelo," Right.  Yeah.  Okay, fair enough.  Kevin, you do it.",7,22,127
Deangelo, Someone want to sit in Kevin’s lap?  Angela?,7,22,127
Deangelo," Okay, Jimmy, this is for you.  Show you that anything is possible.",7,22,127
Deangelo," This is also for the troops.  [backs up, bounces ball, starts running, jumps, lands in front of Kevin, jumps again, pulls himself up by the net, dunks ball, hangs on rim]  Doctor is in! [hoop starts to fall] Ahhhh! [hoop crashes down on Deangelo]  				",7,22,127

Meredith," Michael. Michael, please, can we talk to you about this memo?",1,3,3
Meredith," Could you mean vagina? Because if you do, I want that covered.",1,3,3
Meredith, A uterus is different from a vagina. I still have a vagina.  				,1,3,3
Meredith," “Happy Bird-day” Um… “Meredith, good news. You’re not actually a year older because you work here, where time stands still.”",1,4,4

Meredith," The deal is that this is my last hurrah, cause I made a New Year’s resolution that I’m not going to drink anymore. During the week.  				",2,10,17
Meredith, Hi. I’m Meredith and I’m an alch… good at supplier relations.,2,15,22
Meredith," In five years, I’d like to be… five years sober.",2,15,22
Meredith," “Happy Valentine’s Day darling. Love Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration.”",2,16,23
Meredith," Um, fif–well, fifty… I… over ordered because they had a back order.",2,18,25

Meredith, I thought you’re not supposed to wear white to a wedding.,3,15,45
Meredith, Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Get off! Get off me! Get off me!,3,16,46
Meredith, Thanks. I know how to drive. [dumps the crumbs from a bag of chips she was eating into her mouth and throws it out the window],3,21,51
Meredith, It’s a little too tight. I’m gonna find another spot.,3,21,51
Meredith," Oh I’m excited. Today is Beach Day! And Michael is taking the whole office to the beach. So I’m wearing my bathing suit underneath my shirt [lifts up shirt, definitely ",3,22,52
Meredith," You know what? Don’t even worry about it. Everyone was so drunk, I bet no one even remembers what you said. ",3,23,53
Meredith," I would never do that.  Waste of money.  In my experience, guys are way more attracted to the back of you than the front.  				",3,23,53
Meredith," No don’t bother the nurse, just put it back in.",4,1,55
Meredith," No, it’s not too bad. They have me on a lot of painkillers.",4,1,55

Meredith, [whispers] I’ll read this when I get home.,4,3,57
Meredith,  Oop.  It just made another sale.  Three eighty.,4,3,57
Meredith,"  What do you want me to do, not announce it? Four twelve.  				",4,3,57
Meredith," I’m excited about doing the ad, but I’m not really used to doing videos with so many people around.  				",4,5,59
Meredith," What is Jim thinking? It’s a birthday, so what if there’s a lot of them? ",4,7,61
Meredith,  What should we do with all these leftovers?,5,1,63
Meredith, I’ll smoke with you.  I got a bag of cigars in my purse.,5,2,64

Meredith, Well for the past six years I have been sleeping with him in exchange for discounts on our supplies and Outback Steakhouse gift certificates.,5,2,64
Meredith," Exchange of steak.  Have you ever had sirloin steak, honey?",5,2,64
Meredith," Liaisons, you mean meet-ups?  I don’t know, once a month for six years.  Something like that.",5,2,64
Meredith," Nah, I wouldn’t have done it if it wasn’t for the discount paper.  There’s not a lot of fruit in those looms.",5,2,64
Meredith,"Well it’s funny.  Maybe it’s a girl thing, but after we did it, and he would give me those coupons, I just felt good about myself. [Holly begins to write in her notebook] Hey what’s going on here?  I thought I had immunity?",5,2,64
Meredith, You know I once dated a couple of guys from Cornell. They were really nice. They gave me a ride home.,5,5,67

Meredith, There’s a star-shaped thing taped under the kitchen table.,5,11,73
Meredith, Michael? You ran over me with your car. You posted a picture of my bare boobs on the bulletin board with a caption that said “Gross”… ,5,13,75
Meredith," Michael, you are the reason I drink. You are the reason I live to forget.",5,13,75
Meredith, She’s right. I had my second kid just for the vacation.,5,15,77
Meredith, [seeing Kelly tear a paper heart in half] What are you doing?,5,16,78
Meredith, I’ll help. [Meredith tears the wings off of a Cupid]  Now it’s just a stupid baby.,5,16,78
Meredith," [to Oscar, motioning to male intern and female intern] Think she did him?",6,1,81

Meredith,"   Niagara Falls in October?  Pfft, hells yeah.",6,2,82
Meredith,"   I’ll just have whatever’s fanciest, unless there’s ribs.  I’ll just get the other information the day of, I’ll text you.  ",6,2,82
Meredith, My kid needs shoes! You want to tell him he doesn’t get shoes?!,6,3,83
Meredith, What the hell?! [everyone complaining at Jim],6,3,83
Meredith, You’re not saying anything. At least Jim was being direct…  ,6,3,83
Meredith, …when he was telling us his dumbass plan. ,6,3,83
Meredith, Why can’t you? My time is just as valuable as yours.,6,3,83
Meredith, All morning I look forward to my afternoon cigars and I’m not stopping for anyone.  				,6,4,84

Meredith, Well I caught my son taking a dump on the upper part of the toilet. ,6,5,85
Meredith," Oh, ’cause you spent so much on the wedding. ",6,6,86
Meredith, I don’t think it rained. My hip would be throbbing.,6,7,87
Meredith, I really didn’t want to put it on the board but I thought maybe it was gonna come out somehow so… what are you gonna do? [she writes ‘sex with a terrorist’]  				,6,7,87
Meredith," [as Jim enters the kitchen] Hey, what’s up lifeguard?",6,7,87
Meredith,"  Hey everybody, he’s not in the men’s room although the seat was warm so we may have just missed him.  ",6,8,88

Karen," That’s Drake. And just so you know, I don’t want to be weird or anything, but we use to date.",3,17,47
Karen," Well, if you’re wondering why his wife was staring daggers at me, it’s because I kinda saw him for a little bit while they were separated. ",3,17,47
Karen, Really? I thought it was so obvious. I’m glad it didn’t make you uncomfortable.,3,17,47
Karen," Ok. Oh, um, don’t mention that you and I are dating cause I think he might still have feelings for me. ",3,17,47

Karen," Bye.  Ok, so this is what’s gonna happen.  You’re gonna suck it up.",3,18,48
Karen," Hey, maybe you want to come over and raid my closet?  ",3,18,48

Karen," Um, well, Jim and I were talking and Roy walked in looking super angry.",3,18,48
Karen," And he’s a big dude, you know?  And all of a sudden, Jim pushed me out of the way, and Roy cocked his fist, and then bam, Dwight sprays him and knocks him on his butt.  ",3,18,48
Karen," When I heard Jim and Pam had kissed, my reaction was to have lots of long talks with Jim about our feelings.  Roy just attacked him.  I’m not sure which one Jim hated more.  				",3,18,48
Karen, Maybe you just feel guilty about all the pranks.,3,18,48
Karen, Hmm…  I don’t know.  Maybe you should go back out there and sell paper so we can go on a trip.  				,3,18,48
Karen, I don’t know this place as well as I thought I did.  I’m getting cleaned out.  					,3,19,49
Karen, Actually I think you could make the argument that it wastes time.,3,20,50
Karen," Hey, did you guys see this memo that Dwight sent out? [reads memo] “Women will be sent home if they wear makeup or heels exceeding 1/4 inch. Females are not allowed to speak to strangers unless given written authorization by Dwight Schrute.” This is ridiculous.",3,21,51
Karen," Dwight, this memo that you distributed is insulting.",3,21,51
Karen," Look, it’s really simple. We just want you guys to treat us with respect.",3,21,51
Karen, What you’re saying is extremely misogynistic.,3,21,51
Karen," Frankly, it’s kind of insulting. But I have a bunch of stuff I need to return in my car. So… I could do that.  				",3,21,51
Karen," Look, most relationships have their rough patches. You just have to push through it sometimes.",3,21,51
Karen, [lifts up blindfold] Oh my God! You ass! [chases Jim and throws egg at him] [both laugh]  				,3,22,52

Karen," Hey, uh, before I leave tonight, would you mind making a half a dozen copies of Jim’s and my sales reports for our interviews tomorrow? ",3,23,53
Karen, Do you want to get back together with her? ,3,23,53
Karen, [moves to block Jim from Pam’s eyeline] Oh my God.  Can you believe that?,3,23,53
Karen," All right, you guys.  See you later, wish us luck!",3,23,53

Karen," That wasn’t him. [Jim nods, mouths, yes, it was]  				",3,23,53
Karen, So what’s going to happen to us when I get this job? ,3,23,53
Karen," Exactly.  But you get it, right? Can’t stay there. ",3,23,53
Karen," So, that’s… my basic 5 year plan.  And after that, who knows? ",3,23,53
Karen, He’s a very nice man.  And he’s very well suited for the job he has now.,3,23,53

Karen," Okay, good!  Because, um, a bunch of my friends are meeting downtown for lunch.  And, I was gonna meet them, so…",3,23,53
Karen," Thanks Ro.  Hey, we finally connected.  How’s Scranton?  				",4,6,60
Karen, I am the regional manager of Dunder-Mifflin Utica branch.  Turns out it’s a pretty easy gig when your boss isn’t an idiot and your boyfriend’s not in love with somebody else.  				,4,6,60
Karen," Look, All I’m saying is it would be a great opportunity, and we’d love to have you come aboard.  So think about it, okay?  Okay, bye.  				",4,6,60
Karen," Look, for the record, a certain Scranton salesman approached me, okay?  				",4,6,60
Karen, I’m pretty sure his family’s coming with him.,4,6,60
Karen," I cried for weeks over that guy, so yeah, seeing him climb out of a PT Cruiser in a ladies warehouse uniform, felt pretty good.  				",4,6,60
Karen," Let me ask you, did you accomplish what you wanted?",4,6,60
Karen," So you’re still doing this kind of stuff, huh?",4,6,60
Karen," If you wanted to see me, you could have just called me like an adult.",4,6,60
Karen," Oh, things are going really well?  Are they?  They are?  That’s great, that’s so great.  I wanna hear more about how happy you are with Pam.  Can you tell me more about that?  Thank you so much for coming to Utica, and breaking my copier, and telling me how well things are going in your relationship, really, thank you.",4,6,60
Karen," Traffic, yeah.  Oh, def- go, go because of traffic, definitely, beat-beat the traffic, mm-hmm.",4,6,60

Creed," Then why is there a picture of a white man on the door? [Michael, along with the camera, look at the standard stick man on the bathroom door.]",2,21,28
Creed, I know exactly what he’s talking about. I sprout mung beans on a damp paper towel in my desk drawer. Very nutritious. But they smell like death.  					,2,21,28
Creed, There’s a great soup kitchen in downtown Scranton. Delicious pea soup on Thursdays. I’ll probably give the money to them.   				,2,22,29

Debbie Brown.  And which day was that?  Wednesday, the eleventh.  Perfect.  				",3,20,50
Creed, The only difference between me and a homeless man is this job.  I will do whatever it takes to survive.  Like I did… when I was a homeless man.  				,3,20,50
Creed," When I went over Wednesday, for the spot-check, I got a call from Debbie Brown, saying she has an emergency dentist appointment.",3,20,50

Creed, [to Dwight] Got a farewell card for Debbie Brown.  I thought maybe you’d like to sign it.  Maybe throw a couple of bucks in there for her.  She’s got some children.  				,3,20,50
Creed," I feel terrible about Debbie Brown.  She got fired because of Dwight.  So I thought I’d pass around a goodbye card, maybe everyone could put in a couple of bucks to help her through these difficult times.  Why do bad things always happen to the good people?  It’s tragic.  Just tragic.  				",3,20,50
Creed," The guy was just hanging brain. I mean, what’s all the fuss?  				",3,21,51

David," Frankly, it’s overdue.  Your behavior in the last two years has been completely erratic.",3,23,53
David," Recently, you don’t even show an interest in your work!  You smoke constantly in your office.  You spend most of the day online shopping.  You disappear for hours at a time, sometimes days.  Always saying you’re visiting your sister in Scottsdale.  You go to Scranton far more often than you used to—",3,23,53
David, The time has come for you to end your professional relationship with this company.  You are clearly unstable.,3,23,53
David," Actually, Michael, I think we’re gonna take it in another direction.",3,23,53
David, I don’t know how I feel about hiring a Sixers fan.,3,23,53
David," Uh, let me ask you a question, Jim.  You’re clearly a very bright guy.",3,23,53
David," Always hit your numbers, personable, you make a great impression on everyone you meet—",3,23,53
David," Uh, oh, hey, do you have your quarterly numbers?",3,23,53
David," And that, uh, questionnaire.  Sorry to make you fill that thing out…",3,23,53
David," …that’s a HR formality.  We have this very irritating HR guy here, he’s probably the only person you’re not gonna like.  [Jim notices a small note inside his papers, it reads “Jim, Don’t forget us when you’re famous!  Pam”  It has a gold medal yogurt lid attached.] Kendall.  Ugh.  So, first up…",3,23,53
David, How do you think you function here in New York?,3,23,53
David, You’ve been in the Scranton branch a long time. [Jim stares at Pam’s note] What have you liked most about that place?,3,23,53
David," Okay.  Well, we want the person who takes this position to be here for the long haul.  So… long haul.  Where do you see yourself in ten years?   				",3,23,53
David," [on phone] So, I know we left the other day on a note of uncertainty.  But, after some more thought, I’m very pleased to be able to offer you this job.  [laughs] Great!  I’m so glad.  We’re all very excited you’re going to be joining us.  It’ll be nice to have another MBA around here.",3,23,53
David, All in caps.  Do you know what 911 means?  				,5,8,70
David, Now what I’m curious about is how you were able to go an entire a week without knowing a member of your staff was there.,5,8,70
David, You want me to weigh in on a minor budget issue?,5,9,71
David," Well if I were you, I would just return the surplus and take the bonus.",5,9,71
David, Branch managers who come in under budget get 15% of the savings.,5,9,71
David," So listen, Michael, your branch has been doing great lately, and your sales staff is reporting very strong numbers. Out-performing last year, in fact. Um, and I don’t know exactly how to put this, but… what are you doing right?",5,11,73
David," Utica, Albany, all the other branches are struggling, but your branch is reporting strong numbers. [Michael smiles] Look, you’re not our most traditional guy, but clearly, something you are doing… is right. And I just, I need to get a sense of what that is.",5,11,73
David," Here’s the thing. Michael is doing something right. And in this economic climate, no method of success can be ignored. It’s not really time for executives to start getting judgmental now. It’s Hail Mary time.",5,11,73
David," It’s hard to try and evaluate yourself, Michael, but I appreciate you trying. [gets up] And thanks for coming in.",5,11,73
David," [opens his office door] Yeah, finish up.  				",5,11,73
David," So listen, as you know, we haven’t yet filled the regional supervisor job.",5,12,74
David," Correct. And I was wondering if I could get you to do some of the field work that would normally go to the supervisor [Michael makes exaggerated oh-my-gosh face at camera]. There is an area from Carbondale to Marshbrook, where we have never done any business. ",5,12,74
David," There is a small company there, Prince Paper. I can’t get a report on it because it’s not a public company. But we have been talking about going after their market, so I was hoping you could do some fact finding for me.",5,12,74
David, I’ll fax over some of the things we’re looking for.,5,12,74
David, This is good stuff Michael. You are a titan of industry pal.,5,12,74
David," Look, this is very serious offense.  We have cause to fire you.",5,13,75
David," [on speaker phone] Michael, what the hell is going on here?",5,17,79
David," Why did you OK this golden ticket idea? We’re going to lose a fortune, Michael. How could you let this happen? ",5,17,79
David," Hopefully, nothing that can’t be undone because Dwight I owe you an apology. The head of Blue Cross just called. They were so excited about the golden ticket discount that they have decided to make Dunder Mifflin their exclusive provider of all office supplies. Congratulations Dwight. [holds out hand for handshake]",5,17,79
David, I just want to say that this golden ticket idea is one of the most brilliant signs of initiative I have ever seen at this company and how about a big round of applause for Mr. Dwight Schrute? [everyone starts clapping] ,5,17,79
David," This, this is great. OH, OK, look I want to get you on the horn with the marketing people in New York. The should meet you. ",5,17,79
David," Pam, could you set up a call in there in about 15 minutes, please?",5,17,79
David," You probably have too much to do around here. I don’t want to uh, take up your time with another meeting. ",5,17,79
David," [on speakerphone] Hey guys, I have with me Dwight Schrute. Dwight, take it away. ",5,17,79
David, [on phone] We are gonna call you back guys. [to Michael] What is going on here?,5,17,79
David," [same time as Michael and Dwight] Guys, guys. OK, enough. Please, enough. What, is this true, Dwight? I mean, is this true? ",5,17,79
David," What, I don’t — what do you want me to do now, Michael? What am I supposed to do now? ",5,17,79
David," OK, uhh… I am going back to New York. Pam, do me a favor, don’t send me those notes. ",5,17,79
David,"   Okay, Jim you wanna hit the conference room?",6,2,82
David,"   No, ah it’s okay Michael.  We got it.",6,2,82
David,   [nods] Okay. [Jim smiles and waves to Pam]  				,6,2,82
David,"   Michael, we would like to continue the rest of this meeting in private, please, if you don’t mind.  ",6,2,82
David,"   Alright, well I should go.  Thanks for this.  You’ve given me a lot to think about.  Please promise me you won’t do anything until we speak.  ",6,2,82
David,"   Ah, yeah, could we talk in your office for a second?",6,2,82
David,   Are you sure you’re okay with these new responsibilites?,6,2,82
David,   I’m just trying to figure out the best way to utilize everyone’s talents.  ,6,2,82
David,   What about Jim?  Do you think Jim is someone who is ready to move into a management position?  ,6,2,82
David," [reading performance report]  “Constant office distractions, spends way too much time at reception, antagonizes other salesman, not at all what he thinks he is.”  ",6,2,82
David,   Is there anybody else you think could run the day to day of the branch?  ,6,2,82
David,   Jim had an interesting idea to help you with this extra work load and it involved you being promoted to oversee all northeast sales and then Jim would be promoted to your position.  ,6,2,82
David,"   Ummm… okay, here’s the thing though.  The plan doesn’t work unless we have someone to replace you.  I was hoping… plus we have to worry about Jim, he has another job offer.  We may have to replace him.  				",6,2,82
David,   Jim can you walk me out to my car for a second.,6,2,82
David,"   So, what, you’re changing your mind about Jim?",6,2,82
David,"   Michael, it seems like you’re cutting in and out… This is not what you said earlier.  ",6,2,82
David,"   Well, it doesn’t change what you showed me in Jim’s file.  ",6,2,82
David,"   Michael, I really don’t know what’s going on [police sirens in background] down there, but… oh, dammit, I am getting pulled over for talking on my cell, dammit.    				",6,2,82
David,"   Hey Michael, you got Jim there with you?  ",6,2,82
David,"   Actually, can you call Jim in? I want him on, please.  ",6,2,82
David,"   Hey guys, so I spoke to Alan, we had kind of an unconventional idea, which I think is pretty cool.  But it only works if everyone’s on board. ",6,2,82
David,   We were thinking of having two branch managers in Scranton.  Both of you guys working as co-managers.  Jim would handle the day to day and Michael you would focus on clients and big picture stuff.  ,6,2,82
David,"   Co-manager and Co-manager.  See, there are a lot of moving pieces and this is the only way I can sell it upstairs.  ",6,2,82
David,"   Alright, hey Michael can you pick up for one second.  [Michael picks up phone] Okay look, I’m not going to force you into anything.  If you’re willing to lose Jim, fine, you just say so and we’ll find another solution, okay.  Is that what you want to do?    				",6,2,82
David,"  Hey, sorry to be getting back to you guys so late.  Things are still a bit unclear, we didn’t officially decide anything yet.",6,9,89
David,"  But if I can be candid with you here Jim, it’s not good.  We fully expect to be out of money by the end of the year.  Insolvent.  So, well… You know what?  I’m sorry, I have to run.  But we will talk soon, OK?",6,9,89
David,"  You know what? I can’t really get my head around anything like that right now, but that’s great.  Keep after it, but I gotta run.",6,9,89
David," I’m glad. I want to introduce you to everyone. First we’ll start with Alan Brand. Alan? CEO. Michael Scott, Branch manager, Scranton.",6,10,90
David," Seated, we have the former congressman, Chris O’Keefe.",6,10,90
David, It was fun when we weren’t on the brink of bankruptcy.,6,10,90
David," [over the crowd booing] Believe me everyone is working very hard, working weekends, struggling, trying to right the ship.",6,10,90
David, What are we supposed to tell them now? Ok? You’ve dug us quite a hole. ,6,10,90
David," No. No. No. No. No. No. Don’t call anybody, Michael.",6,10,90
David," Please do not text anybody, now, Michael.",6,10,90
David," Just so I understand, you started Employee of the Month, give it to yourself, then people complain, so you give it to your wife?",6,11,91
David," Jim, I bumped you up because I thought you could make my life easier.  If you can’t do that, we’re going to have a separate discussion.",6,11,91
David," Uh, hey, I’m sorry.  I’m taking this out on you.",6,11,91
David," It’s been crazy here.  You know I think you’re doing a great job, right?",6,11,91
David," Okay.  Hey, we still on for dinner this weekend?",6,11,91
David, I’m not going to guess. You can tell me or I am going to hang up.,6,12,92
David," Listen, I shouldn’t tell you this, but the company has a buyer. The board will have no choice to approve. They are going to clean house. ",6,12,92
David, You weren’t supposed to tell anyone Michael.,6,12,92
David," I am not supposed to… Okay. Guys. I was really only talking about Alan, myself, a few other execs you don’t know.",6,12,92
David, Look. They’re buying the company for the distribution. You guys are the only thing about this company that works.  So congratulations.,6,12,92
David," Fantastic. Teddy, look who just stopped in.",6,14,94
David, I have a doctor’s appointment next Thursday.,6,14,94
David," Uh, no, sweetie. I just sort of hung out.",6,14,94
David," No. Just hanging out, honey. You remember Michael.",6,14,94
David," Uh, but maybe, uh – actually, you know, I think maybe we’ll go outside. May -maybe we’ll go outside. [drumming intensifies] Outside.  				",6,14,94
David," I don’t know. I mean, what can you do? ",6,14,94
David, I want to tell you about a business idea I have. ,6,14,94
David," Ok? You know how kids leave their toys everywhere? Okay. So this is a vacuum. It’s like a shop-vac type of thing. [imitates vacuum] Teaches kids how to pick up their own toys. Right? Baseball gloves, hacky sacks, drumsticks. [sucking noise] Picks it up!",6,14,94
David," No. No, no, no. That’s the -that’s the vacuum noise.",6,14,94
David," No, it’s ok. Another guy from Dunder Mifflin, Arnie from Research, he’s gonna draw up the prototype. And, uh… It’s like shop-vac. [sucking noise] Did I say that?",6,14,94
David," Hey, you know, if you want, I’m sure I can get Arnie on board if you wanted to join us for suck it. Work together again. ",6,14,94
David," [singing] Well, it’s a mess, what a mess. What you gonna do? You’re going to take out your Suck It and you suck it. Suck it. Yeah, take out your Suck It and you suck it.",6,14,94
David," You picked on the wrong person, I can tell you that. ",7,13,118
David," Ooh! David Brent, my liege. How are you?",7,13,118
David," Oh, there you go. I do characters as well. I got a Chinese fella. He’s called Ho Li [bleep].  That’s what it sounds like. ",7,13,118
David, You can’t do that these days. You can’t. ,7,13,118
David," No, no. No, comedy is a place where the mind goes to tickle itself. That’s what she said. [laughs]. [hugs Michaels] Ohh. ",7,13,118
Jo," Gabe, honey, I love this. I love the sound of your voice. But I really need some new information now. ",6,14,94
Jo," Wait a minute, who is it? Who’s there? Is there somebody in the room with you? [Michael gesturing “no”] I want to see who it is. Turn me around.",6,14,94
Jo," Turn me around. Now. [Michael starts to leave, Jo whistles] Hey, Buddy. Is it something I said?",6,14,94
Jo," Oh, hello, Mr. Scott. Pleased to meet you.",6,14,94
Jo," Aw, thank you. I’ve been working on it since I was a little girl. To, um, to what do I owe the pleasure of this videochat?",6,14,94
Jo," Pardon. Pardon me, Mr. Scott, but the last time I saw a company as mismanaged as Dunder Mifflin, it was my grandson’s snowball company, so you’ll excuse me if I prefer that you all adapt to the way that we do things. ",6,14,94
Jo," So listen, why don’t you tell Gabe if by the end of the day you can’t handle the changes.",6,14,94
Jo, I would take until the end of the day if I were you. [Michael leaves conference room]  				,6,14,94
Jo," Oh, that’s Mrs. Bennett, sweetheart. My husband and I are divorced, but I kept the “Mrs.” just to piss off the new wife. Well, let’s take a gander around this place.",6,15,95
Jo, Do you always stay seated when a lady enters the room?,6,15,95
Jo, Another couple of heartbreakers. Who is this tall drink of sun tea?,6,15,95
Jo, [gesturing to Michael] I thought this guy was the manager?,6,15,95
Jo, Two guys doing one job? We gotta do something about that!  				,6,15,95
Jo," This is knucklehead talk. I’m not gonna bite it, you know. You can’t give me gravy and tell me it’s jelly, because gravy ain’t sweet! Is it, Jim?",6,15,95
Jo," I think one of you should return to sales, and the other one be manager.",6,15,95
Jo," Well, I’m gonna let this marinate. So you can go.",6,15,95
Jo," I’m Jolene Bennett, Jo for short. I’m a breast cancer survivor, close, personal friends with Nancy Pelosi, and Truman Capote and I slept with three of the same guys. When I was a little girl, I was terrified to fly, and now I have my own pilot’s license. I am CEO of Sabre International, and I sell the best damn printers and all-in-one machines Korea can make. Pleased to meet you.   				",6,15,95
Jo," [to Angela, who’s having a hard time deciding on a chair] Just choosing seats, not getting married. Chop, chop little onion!",6,15,95
Jo," That’s right, darlin’, now you’re the proud new owner of a Sabre handbook and my autobiography. Now, you all must be in a tizzy. I can see it on your faces, I mean, what’s going on now? I mean, who owns Dunder Mifflin? Right? I mean, Sabre? What’s that? Some company I’ve never heard of? Down in Tallahassee? Where is that? Near Mars?",6,15,95
Jo," Now Dunder Mifflin has an arm’s reach in all these small businesses all over the northeast. Now we’re gonna take that arm, and we’re gonna start selling printers. ",6,15,95
Jo, They’re the easiest-to-use printers on the market.,6,15,95
Jo, I think that’s it. So we’re all good! [many employees raise their hands] Thanks ya’ll.,6,15,95
Jo," Oh, speak of the devil. We were just talking about you. Have a seat!",6,15,95
Jo, Now Jim here is thinking about taking himself out of the running for being manager.,6,15,95
Jo," Well, I think you’re both being a little too modest.",6,15,95
Jo," You know, Michael, you have more experience in sales and management, so I’m gonna defer to your judgment.",6,15,95
Jo," I think you [to Michael] will become the salesman, and congratulations! [to Jim] You’re gonna be the new manager of this branch!",6,15,95
Jo," You two are grown-ass men. What do I have to do, fire you and get two people in here who don’t need so much management?",6,15,95
Jo," Fine. I don’t care which one of you does which job, just stop meeting with me to talk about it.",6,15,95
Jo," [cell phone rings] Oh, I gotta take this. Yep. Uh, finish walking my dogs for me. And don’t ride ’em. Lotta people try to ride ’em.  				",6,15,95
Jo," Oh, I love this, so much fun! There’s such team spirit in this room! ‘Morning Darling!",6,17,97
Jo," Well, this is my last day at the Scranton branch for a while. But I’m leaving it in the very capable hands of some of the loveliest people I’ve ever had the pleasure of knowing. Oh I’m gonna miss this place. And the snow! Hoo, my dogs love peeing in that snow! Makes me think they’re onto something.  				",6,17,97
Jo, I’m sorry but is that a gift I see in your hands?,6,17,97
Jo, [pulls out glass cube with coal.] Is that a lump of coal? ,6,17,97
Jo," Err, thank you very much. We, we don’t get to see much coal in Tallahassee, I’m used to alligators, and some of the worst Chinese food you’ve ever tasted.",6,17,97
Jo," Well, if you ever get down in my neck of the woods, you got a place to stay.  				",6,17,97
Jo," Now, after all the talking I’ve been doing. It’s your turn. This is a town hall meeting. I want to hear what you all sound like. ",6,17,97
Jo," Thank you. You know I get way too many ideas from the top. Now I want to hear your ideas. I mean, did you guys know that Liquid Paper? That wasn’t invented by some fancy engineer. No, that was created by a lowly typist. ",6,17,97
Jo, You know it doesn’t have to be an invention.,6,17,97
Jo," I am so proud of Sabre’s “Print In All Colors” initiative. Any Sabre employee of color, is welcome to apply. [Kelly applauds]  Daryl?",6,17,97
Jo, [Looks over his proposal] I like this Daryl. I like this a lot. Maybe you should be doing your sketching upstairs. Would you like an office up here?,6,17,97
Jo,"  Okay. Any questions? Anything on anybody’s mind? I’m leaving tonight, this is your last chance for a while!",6,17,97
Jo," Yes, well okay. Florida ain’t that far away.",6,17,97
Jo," Oh honey. I’m not home, very often. And uh, me and my relatives, they take up the guesthouse. I think you should check with my office, before you book any dates, okay?",6,17,97
Jo," No, that’s very generous of you, but I’m all set.",6,17,97
Jo, How many knocks does it take to get you to do some work?,6,17,97
Jo," Oh no honey, if you got a bug, I want you to go on home. I can’t have you getting Callie and Jo Jr. sick. These dogs have got to be in a commercial with Dwight Howard next week.",6,17,97
Jo," Yeah, but you sound like death, girl. Now why don’t you go on home and take care of yourself and get in bed. And shred that and have them send me a clean fax, okay?",6,17,97
Jo, Oh! You’re sick! [Andy coughs] Dangit! That’s exactly why I sent that receptionist home.,6,17,97
Jo, We don’t need any heroes here honey. It’s time for you to get on home now. ,6,17,97
Jo, You’ll probably feel better once you get some pants on. Come on.  				,6,17,97
Jo, Well there’s chatting time and there’s working time. I’m still on working time.,6,17,97
Jo," Well, if you feel like you’ve done a solid days work…",6,17,97
Jo," Well I mean, if you can put your name on this day, and be proud of the amount of work you’ve done, then, by all means, you should toodle on home.",6,17,97
Jo," Oh, you don’t become the most powerful woman in Tallahassee by slacking off. [Scoffs] You do it by working hard. Or marrying rich. I did both!  				",6,17,97
Jo," Well sure. You know, you go ahead and push some printers.",6,17,97
Jo, Overnight all my damn bags home. I’m carrying nothing but my Sable gloves.  I’ve had it with Homeland Security. And I want you to put all those tracking numbers in my Blackberry.,6,17,97
Jo, Howdy. I hope I’m not interrupting anything.,6,24,104
Jo," ‘Course you all, no doubt, know why I’m here.",6,24,104
Jo," Turns out our printers are famous. They’re all over the news. It’s an interesting story. Cheap foreign printers attacking innocent Americans. Well, actually the, the real story isn’t quite as racy, but uh… let’s give it a go.",6,24,104
Jo," Not long ago, we discovered a defect in one of our printers, so we got a software patch and fixed it right up, just like that. I don’t know how it works. But just as we were about to send out a letter to our affected customers, giving ’em free toner, and we keep ’em, happy, but somebody here, they liked that first story better. The one where we lose half our clients for no damn good reason! Whoever it was who talked to the press, they should come forward, please.",6,24,104
Jo," [as Gabe hands out forms to everyone] It’s a little form, says “I did not do it.” ",6,24,104
Jo," All that’s just birthday information, Michael.",6,24,104
Jo," Why don’t you come with me? We’ll start out with the honcho, what’cha say?",6,24,104
Jo," When Mama was working as a prison guard and something went missing, she’d ask one question:",6,24,104
Jo," So say we catch this whistleblower, what do you think I should do with him?",6,24,104
Jo," Well, I guess we’re all right, Michael.",6,24,104
Jo," Yeah, I noticed you’ve had a great year. Good boy… you turning that money into more money?",6,24,104
Jo," I don’t like to tell a man what to do with his money, but if you ain’t investing in property, then you’re dumber than a dummy.",6,24,104
Jo," Well, buy property. That’s my advice.  				",6,24,104
Jo, Sounds like you were as blindsided by this as I was. ,6,24,104
Jo, And we didn’t find anything on your computer.,6,24,104
Jo, Except this. [hands stack of paper to Toby],6,24,104
Jo," I know what it is. I skimmed the first chapter. I’m just curious, why would a man who hates people want to have a relationship with a maid?",6,24,104
Jo," The way I look at it, there’s only one of two reasons. He knows a secret about her that she doesn’t know herself, or he wants to use her services to mop up after a murder.",6,24,104
Jo, Because I want to deal with it the way I deal with it.,6,24,104
Jo," Empathize with me for a moment. I came up here with a big problem, and now I got a branch manager who’s giving me the silent treatment… Speak to me… speak. [Jo’s dog barks] Come with me.",6,24,104
Jo," Honey, you don’t seem like your normal self.",6,24,104
Jo," When I was growing up, there was nothing better than being a big old business tycoon. And I thought I’d break that glass ceiling and be a hero to all those little girls out there… and they’d make a Barbie out of me.",6,24,104
Jo," I, did I sell cheap printers? I do. But if I have to go out there in front of the press and make one of them public apology recalls, I mean, it’s all I’ll ever be remembered for. Nobody will want to play with my Barbie.",6,24,104
Jo," Hey, I appreciate you reading that statement. You looked pretty up there.",6,24,104
Jo," Well, give me a shout if I can brighten your life.",6,24,104
Jo," Lower yourself, Gabe. I don’t wanna be having a conversation with your crotch. Ok, educate me now why you won’t fire the boy. ",7,1,106
Jo," Well, I got a nephew too. But he don’t work for me. You know why? Cause he’s a screw-up. He can swim in my pool but he can’t come in my house.",7,1,106
Jo," If you keep him, Michael, I’m gonna hold you accountable for him. You’re on the hook for this kid. You got that? Cover his ass like tighty-whities.",7,1,106
Jo," Was how I put it not clear enough? I mean, you had to go and make up your own saying? Deal with it, boys.   				",7,1,106
Jo," “The moment Darla put the cupcake in her mouth, her daddy pulled her aside and said, “You’re Too Fat.

Jo, Shooting is worse! Are you kidding me? It’s not even in the same – you shot a gun? What is wrong with you? ,7,23,128
Jo, Beaumont-Adams is a girl’s gun. That just makes it plain stupid. ,7,23,128
Jo," Oh, stop asking yourself easy questions so you can look like a genius. ",7,23,128
Jo," I love you, Dwight. But you don’t fit this job. ",7,23,128
Jo," No, child. No. It’s over. Now I gotta find a replacement for my replacement.   				",7,23,128
Jo, You three are my search committee. You’re in charge of finding me my next manager. All righty? ,7,23,128
Jo," Till then, we need a new acting manager. Now, who’s got the most experience in this office? ",7,23,128
Jo,"  [walks in with her dogs] Gabe, honey! Oh, lord. Take all this. [gives the dog leashes and multiple bags to Gabe] ",7,24,129
Jo,  Here. Jim! Did you hear Stern this morning?,7,24,129
Jo,"  Ohh, Robin was good. She’s always good. Keeps him on his toes. Its Howard’s show though. [picks up resume from Jim’s desk] Whose is this? Darryl Philbin. Ohh. Very nice to see a familiar face on top. Ah… a little long aren’t we? Four pages? Is this the same Darryl Philbin who’s had two jobs in ten years at one company?",7,24,129
Jo,"  Coordinated and implemented receipt storage and delivery of over 2.5 billion units of inventory. 2.5 billion, Darryl? 2.5 billion units of what?",7,24,129
Jo,  Question 1. Ever shot a gun in the office?,7,24,129
Jo,"  Welcome to Scranton, Jo. Land of a thousand problems only you can fix. [Jo’s phone starts vibrating, she picks it up and sees Dwight has texted her “Dwight’s ability as a manager has lead him to higher levels of proffesional success,”] Oh for god’s sake. He’s texting me his resume one line at a time. These are costing me ten cents a piece, you jackass! I’m roaming!  				",7,24,129
Jo,"  No, send him in. [to Search Committee] Who is this?",7,24,129
Jo,  I want to talk to Dwight Schrute for a second. I want to ask him a question. [Gabe gets up to leave] If he isn’t here in sixty seconds…,7,24,129
Jo,  Let’s just say I had hired this Jack Souvenir. Then what?,7,24,129
Jo,  That’s f***ing crazy. [Jo and Dwight both smile] Get outta here. [Dwight leaves] What a nutjob.  				,7,24,129
Jo,"  Okay, it’s fun to talk about the rejects, but uh, who’s got ya excited?",7,24,129
Jo,  Who’s this fella? Went to Cornell. What’s wrong with him?,7,24,129
Jo,  So it’s not relevant that he took the receptionist away from you?,7,24,129
Jo,  Gabe…ugh… you got all close to these people. Got involved in their lives. Let’s get you back to Florida. We’ll figure out something for you.,7,24,129
Jo,  It’s not. Let’s get Kelly in here to take his place.,7,24,129
Jo,  ‘Cause Gabe’s tall and weak. She’s short and strong. I’m doing an opposites thing.,7,24,129
Jo,"  Well, I’m not saying you must hire her. If you find someone who’s clearly a fit, then fine. Just make sure they fit real good. No more manager turnover. Don’t mess this up, Jim. And give Dwight an interview. I like a little bit of crazy.  				",7,24,129
Roy," No, no. Come on. Let’s get out of here and go home.",1,1,1
Roy," It sounds good. Seriously, we’ve gotta get going.",1,1,1
Roy, [yelling] What the hell is this? What are you trying to cop a feel or something? Huh Halpert?,1,4,4
Roy, [looking at Dwight] An alliance? What the hell is he talking about?,1,4,4
Roy," Don’t listen to him Pam. Trust me, tip it my way or you’re sleeping in the car.",1,5,5
Roy," [steals the ball, scores, mimics singing] Du-du-du-du-dupee-do. Your ball.",1,5,5
Roy," No, no, no, I’m not coming in on Saturday.",1,5,5
Roy, [to Jim] Look at Larry Bird. Larry Legend.,1,5,5
Roy," Hey, Jimmy what do you think of that little purse girl, huh?  ",1,6,6
Roy," [Katy walks through breakroom] Man, I would be all over that if I wasn’t dating Pam. ",1,6,6
Roy," Huh? huh?  Come on… Come on, Pammy I was just kidding. ",1,6,6
Roy, I was just kidding.  You know I didn’t mean it. I can’t…  				,1,6,6
Roy," [on video] Ah, w-we’ll see you next year.",2,1,8
Roy, …talking about? He’s a jackass every year.,2,1,8
Roy," [Put’s his hand on Pam’s arm] Come on, we’re going to Poor Richard’s.",2,1,8
Roy, So you don’t have the biggest package. Don’t feel bad. ,2,2,9
Roy," Okay, I’m going to go wait in the parking lot. And what kind of tunes you want for the ride? Little, uh, classical? Or oldies?",2,2,9
Roy, What’s up? Can I hang out with you guys for a bit? ,2,4,11
Roy, The warehouse guys are a bunch of jackasses sometimes.   				,2,4,11
Roy," Uh… Oh, I got it! Uh, what’s the name of that, uh, tight ass, uh, Christian, uh, chick. The, uh, the blond? ",2,4,11
Roy, [looks around conference room] You’re joking right?,2,7,14
Roy," Yeah, I was gonna get you one of these for Christmas, and now I don’t have to. I’m gonna save a ton of money.",2,10,17
Roy," I don’t know. Probably like, a sweater or something.  				",2,10,17
Roy," I think after I lost Culpepper and T.O it was over, man.",2,10,17
Roy," It’s possible. I can’t believe you traded Shaun Alexander, man.",2,10,17
Roy, Come on! Shaun Alexander? He’s the best back in the league.,2,10,17
Roy," No, she was totally Miss Artsy-Fartsy in high school. She wore the turtleneck and everything!",2,11,18
Roy," Piss slop who cares-a? We played you! You… you really look familiar. Did you… you cheered for them, didn’t you?",2,11,18
Roy, I remember that! We crushed you like 42-10!  				,2,11,18
Roy," Whoo! Who’s next? Come on, Pam! Come on! Come on!",2,11,18
Roy, I’ve just gotta wait for Darryl to do his shot. Just a minute. Come on! [chanting] Darryl! Darryl!  				,2,11,18
Roy," When you were in the Navy, did you ever almost die?",2,11,18
Roy," Hello, everybody, could I have your attention for just a second? Could you listen to me for a second? We were up at the front, and we were talking about what’s really important, and… Pam, I think enough is enough. I think we should set a date for our wedding. How about June 10th? Come on, let’s do it! Come on, Pam!  				",2,11,18
Roy," We can go back in, like, a couple of weeks maybe.  ",2,14,21
Roy," Okay, maybe another month, like, maybe for, like President’s Day or something.",2,14,21
Roy," Jim… Halpert. Hey uh, I, uh, you know heard there’s a rumor going around about you used to have a crush on Pam.",2,15,22
Roy," No, it’s cool, because I know you’re a good guy. And I know that that crush ended a long time ago, so… you know. We’re cool, right?",2,15,22
Roy," You know, it’s great with me cause that way, glad she has a friend at work she can get through the day with. She’s not all bap bap bap bap when she gets home.",2,15,22
Roy, I hate it when girls insist on taking them out to new restaurants every weekend night and then they’re like “When are we going to go on a date-date?”,2,15,22
Roy," Well, Valentine’s Day isn’t over. Let’s get you home and you are gonna get the best sex of you life.   				",2,16,23
Roy, [wrestling with Jake] Pam! Pam! I love this guy! [laughs] Come on!  					,2,18,25

Roy," Hey, I saw your tape. Your band, Scrantonicity? You guys rock.",2,22,29
Roy," Okay. Hey, don’t try to lose too much money, all right?",2,22,29
Roy," If you still want a honeymoon. Hey, Halpert. Keep an eye on her, all right?",2,22,29
Roy," After Pam dumped me, I um, I kinda stopped taking care of myself there, and uh, I hit bottom when uh, drunk driving arrest.  I’ve been working out and um, you know, I’m not gonna take her for granted.  I gotta win her back.  					",3,1,31
Roy," Excuse me, I’m sorry to interrupt, uh, I need to see Pam.  There seems to be, like, something wrong with the radiator in her car. ",3,4,34
Roy, [as they leave] There’s nothing wrong with your car.  I just thought you might like a break from the “grief counseling” session.,3,4,34
Roy," [laughs]  Well, you’re not still driving so fast, are you?   Yeah.    				",3,4,34
Roy," I don’t really want to work here without Pam. You know that Cinderella song, “You Don’t Know What You Got (Till It’s Gone)”? That pretty much says it better than how I know how to say it… in words.  				",3,7,37
Roy," Yeah, man! I’m uh… I’m really glad you’re still gonna be working here.",3,7,37
Roy, OK. And where to do you get all those cool bows? ,3,10,40
Roy," OK. Are you sure I can’t use like, the cartoons from the newspaper? ",3,10,40
Roy," [Karen walks in] Hey. All right, I’ll see you guys later. [leaves room]",3,10,40
Roy, Which one is she? [Michael stares at both waitresses],3,10,40
Roy," [starts clapping] Mike, you are a rock star, man. You are the man! Well done.",3,11,41
Roy," That corporate booty, he likes to hit it!  ",3,11,41
Roy," Hey, remember when we were planning our honeymoon and you wanted to go to Hawaii and I wanted to go to Mexico?",3,11,41
Roy," I was definitely right. [both laugh] Oh, brother.  ",3,11,41
Roy, I’m not really into strippers.  You know what I find sexy?  Pam’s art.  She’s an artist and I appreciate that.  It’s very moving and sexy.  The art.  ,3,14,44
Roy," I know I normally don’t notice these kind of things but uh… This wedding’s really nice! I mean, the flowers and stuff? Phyllis has got some great taste.",3,15,45
Roy,"  I know you’re probably not going to remember this, right? But um… Those color roses? I got you those color roses for our prom.",3,15,45
Roy, I uh guess I wasn’t really too involved in the planning.,3,15,45
Roy, You think this sucks for you? I was the one who actually wanted to get married.  					,3,15,45
Roy, I know. Uh… I gave them twenty bucks. You want to dance?   					,3,15,45
Roy," [to Pam] Hey, want to get out of here?  					",3,15,45
Roy," Good. Alright I brought my brother, huh? ",3,16,46
Roy," How ’bout this, huh? I show up with my brother, and, no one from work is here? That’s… pretty cool, huh?  				",3,16,46
Roy," It’s cool if I go, right? I mean, I looked at all of them.",3,16,46
Roy, Your art.. was the prettiest art of… all art.,3,16,46
Roy," I can’t. My brother, he just unloaded the jet ski’s and kinda took a bath, so… we’re going to go get hammered.",3,17,47
Roy," You said it was important, so… How’s it going?",3,17,47
Roy," One, two, three, up Jenkins! Down Jenkins. Oh, I think I heard the quarter over here. ",3,17,47
Roy, [points at one of Stanley’s hands and one of Pam’s] Not here. Not here. It’s either here or here. [Stares at Pam] Not here. [Points at Stanley’s hand]. ,3,17,47
Roy," I didn’t do anything. Ask anyone, I totally could have and I didn’t at all.",3,17,47
Roy," No, I am listening! That’s the problem I am listening!",3,17,47
Roy," Yeah, you’re right. This is so over. You kidding me, Pam!? Come on! God!",3,17,47
Roy," [to Jim] Hey man, uh… I’m sorry. [Jim motions “Don’t worry about it”] [Roy receives his check from Angela] Thanks. [to Pam] Can I, like, see you after work for coffee, or… something?",3,18,48
Roy," Please.  I just got some stuff I gotta say to you. [Pam nods, meekly]",3,18,48
Roy," I’m so sorry, Pammy.  I really wasn’t gonna do anything.  But then I… kept thinkin’ about you two together, and…  I just thought you guys were really good friends, or… or maybe he was gay or somethin’… Not that that’s wrong.",3,18,48
Roy, So you gonna start datin’ Halpert then?,3,18,48
Roy," Oh yeah… Wait a minute, you… broke off our wedding for the guy.",3,18,48
Roy, But you’re not even gonna try to go out with him? [Pam meekly shakes her head] I don’t get you Pam.,3,18,48
Roy," Hey, what’s up, guys? How you been?  				",5,4,66

Danny, It’s good to see you guys. Nice to meet you.,7,5,110
Danny," I’m gonna take off my coat, if you don’t mind. It’s a bit warm in here.",7,5,110
Danny," Well, actually, uh… no, Miss Van Helsing, that’s not why I’m here. I’m here to meet you, see if we’d be a, you know, good fit.",7,5,110
Danny," We should think of this as a first date. And I think it’s going very well, how ’bout you?",7,5,110
Danny," Ha ha, okay, there you go! [phone rings, Meredith answers]",7,5,110
Danny," I’ve never been a desk man. Always traveling on the road. Come on…why not, huh?",7,5,110
Danny," Well, we’ll get this…[Meredith unbuttons]",7,5,110
Danny," You know what? I may have parked my car in a compact space, and I hate when I see others do that, so-",7,5,110
Danny," Okay, so you…set up this fake company, then you hired this homeless woman to impersonate an executive to spy on me so that you could copy my sales technique?",7,5,110
Danny," Oh, well then, yeah. All right. Hey! [knocking on wall] Good luck, guys. Seems like you got a great operation here.",7,5,110
Danny," What do you mean, my tricks? There’s no tricks, man. I’m just a good salesman. You wanna copy that? You can’t copy that! [opens door to leave]",7,5,110
Danny," Sure. You seem like a fun, professional guy.",7,5,110

Danny," Oh, you know…funny. Your wife and I went on a few dates.",7,5,110
Danny, Obviously. I don’t even think she called me back.,7,5,110
Danny," Excuse me, everybody. I want to invite you all to the Halloween party I’m having at my bar.",7,6,111
Danny, I was looking forward to throwing some darts with you guys.,7,6,111
Danny, Jim and Pam really don’t want you to go?,7,6,111
Danny," Look, I’m just glad we can laugh about it. Because I was a little nervous about coming to work here, with, you know, our history.",7,6,111
Danny," [laughing] Well, that does not sound like me. ",7,6,111
Danny," [stops laughing] Well, great, I just wanted to make sure that things weren’t weird.",7,6,111
Danny, I don’t think it’s gonna work out the way you think.,7,6,111
Danny," You know what it was? I think she gave me her number but then her fours look like eights, and…",7,6,111
Danny, Okay. You wanna know?  I didn’t call her back because she spent the whole date talking about you. She was obviously in love with you.  				,7,6,111
Danny, Do you honestly want to know why I didn’t call her back on a date over four years ago?,7,6,111
Danny, Okay. Honestly. I didn’t call you back because I-thought you seemed a little… dorky. ,7,6,111
Helene,  [walks into the office] Whoohoo! Pammy?,6,8,88

Helene, [sees table decorated with a banner and balloons] Oh my God!,6,8,88
Helene,  Oh you’ll love it.  You can have my guide books.  I think I’m done with those really long plane rides.  ,6,8,88
Helene,"  Well, as long as you’re running numbers Pam, then help me out with this one.  Let’s see your six months pregnant, but you’ve only been married for 30 days, so what does that add up to?",6,8,88
Helene,"  Oh, well I like Nana, but I also like the classic Grandma.",6,8,88
Helene," Oh, Michael what do you think?  Grandma?",6,8,88
Helene," Oh no, I think a triathlon is pretty much something I can rule out.  It just– doesn’t interest me. ",6,8,88
Helene,"  Hmm… I might have done it when I was younger, but now there’s just other things I’d rather be doing, instead of running and jumping and swimming– ",6,8,88
Helene,  Gimme.  Look at this wrapping paper.  It’s got the word love on it in every language.,6,8,88

Helene, It’ll go away in time just don’t touch it.,7,4,109
Helene," I think for you to have come here even expecting that we can have a conversation like this show’s ho-how self deluded you are! Michael, your memory has failed you greatly.",7,4,109
Helene," [holding the baby, walks up to Jim] Hi, honey. I was just changing the baby.",7,7,112

Donna, Oh my God. [realizing Jim and Pam are looking through the conference room windows],6,21,101
Donna," Was it professional? No. But I work in the nightlife industry. I get hit on all the time. In my 20’s it would have been annoying. In my late 20’s, I find it really flattering.   				",6,21,101
Donna, Is this… is this the best you can do right there?,6,21,101
Donna," Oh. Well, I guess I’m just used to the restaurant business, [removes sweater revealing her revealing top] where, if you’re in charge, then you can always get discounts for the people that you like.",6,21,101

Josh, Michael Scott. [sticks out hand for handshake] ,2,16,23
Josh," Not much, they’re uh, I guess running late upstairs, so we’re just waiting for the presentations.",2,16,23
Josh," What about you, Craig, you lose anyone?",2,16,23
Josh," So with the twelve new local accounts, we had a total of four percent organic growth, which was just above our pre-year targets. ",2,16,23
Josh,"  So, end of day we are going to have a little diversity policy refresher, because of some more problems at the Scranton branch.  And I have a list of business startups I got from the chamber.  Yes, I am going to need someone to cold call them.",3,1,31
Josh," Listen, Michael, I heard you were a great salesman.",3,2,32
Josh," And I just want to let you know that if our branch absorbs your branch, I’m going to look for a place for you at Stamford.",3,2,32
Josh, We should probably head on down and hook up with Jan.,3,2,32
Josh," All right, Jan just emailed me. She wants us to meet her up front.",3,2,32
Josh, Jim got us a great lead with a new rep from National Envelope. We can grab lunch with them tomorrow.,3,2,32
Josh," Well, Jim and I have a meeting with Uni-ball in about forty-five minutes, so we should probably go now.",3,2,32
Josh," Or what?  We didn’t bet anything, Michael.",3,2,32
Josh," Yes, I’m aware of Jan and Michael’s… history. Um, I don’t really like to talk about it ’cause it’s unprofessional. Kind of gross.  ",3,2,32
Josh," What? Uh, no. [to Jim] Uh, I want you to make sure you call Karen and get her to fax that vendor list over.",3,2,32
Josh," Um… When I was in the Coast Guard, a couple of us broke into the women’s barracks and we got arrested for trespassing.",3,2,32
Josh," [sounding upset] Andy, Jim, can I see you in the conference room for a minute?",3,3,33
Josh," This is not working, ok?  We are getting slaughtered out there.",3,3,33
Josh," We just need a strategy, ok?  We’re going to set up a trap in the gun room.  All right Jim, are you using the MP-40 or the 44?  ",3,3,33
Josh," What’s going on with Fairfield County schools?  Karen, did you generate that price list?",3,4,34
Josh," Okay, just get it done.  Jim, will you make sure?",3,4,34

Daryl," Uh, Matt is on a delivery. Just leave it here, I’ll take it.",6,12,92
Daryl," Matt’s a pretty good-looking dude, don’t you think?",6,12,92
Daryl," The Sabre shipping method could be more efficient. Combining inventory systems makes sense on paper, but printers and paper ship differently. It’ll be faster to deliver them separately, instead of waiting on everything to come in.",6,17,97
Daryl, Not at all. There’s a way that it can be scheduled. I sketched this out downstairs.,6,17,97
Daryl," [singing] Moving on up, to the East Side, to the deluxe apartment in the sky…  				",6,17,97

Mr. Brown, Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Great.,1,2,2
Mr. Brown," Thank you. Thank you very much. OK. Thanks for filling these out and I promise this’ll be quick. At Diversity Today, our philosophy is about honesty and positive expectations. We believe that 99% of the problems in the workplace arise simply out of ignorance.",1,2,2
Mr. Brown," Uh, see this is what I’m talking about. We don’t have to pretend we’re color-blind.",1,2,2

Mr. Brown,  Thank you very much. And it would also help me if you were seated.,1,2,2
Mr. Brown," Thank you. OK. Now, at the start of the session, I had you all write down an incident that you found offensive in the workplace. Now, what I’m going to do is choose one and we’re going to act it out.",1,2,2
Mr. Brown," Well, it’s my name. It’s not a test. OK? Um, so looking through the cards, I’ve noticed that many of you wrote down the same incident, which is ironic, because it’s the exact incident I was brought in here to respond to. Now, how many of you are familiar with the Chris Rock routine? Very good. OK.  				",1,2,2
Mr. Brown, So we’re going to reenact this with a more positive outcome.,1,2,2
Mr. Brown," Well, let’s have someone who wasn’t involved in the reenactment.",1,2,2

Mr. Brown," Oh, great. Well, what is a hero to you?",1,2,2
Mr. Brown," Now, I need you to take these forms. This kind of expresses the joint experience we had today. And I need you to look ’em over and sign them as kind of a group pledge.",1,2,2
Mr. Brown, We both know that I’m here because of the comments you made.,1,2,2
Mr. Brown," Um, it’s not throwing me. I need your signature.",1,2,2
Mr. Brown," Yes, but you’re not listening to me. Yours is the only signature I need.      ",1,2,2
Mr. Brown, Those are my instructions from the Corporate offices to put you through this seminar for the comments that you made. The reason I made copies for everyone was so you wouldn’t be embarrassed.,1,2,2

Nurse,  Would you like me to take her to the nursery for the night?,6,16,96

Eric," Uh, I just need to check out your warehouse and then talk to your HR guy. That is pretty much the only reason I’m here.",6,13,93
Eric," It’s called ‘due diligence’. Basically, I confirm inventory, take a head count, see if there are any HR liabilities. I’m a glorified fact checker. Actually, I am a fact checker.  				",6,13,93

Lawyer,"  Finally there’s a provision here in the occurrence that the child is born an old man, a la Benjamin Button.",6,23,103
Lawyer,  Despite the provision covering whether this is all part of the matrix–,6,23,103

Martin, Hey! Why doesn’t your car have a flat tire?,3,8,38
Martin, So… you all wanna know what I was in for?,3,9,39
Martin," Um, I really don’t mind. It was a stupid mistake. I was working in finance and, I… got involved in some insider trading. So, I spent a little time in the clink. ",3,9,39
Martin, Not terrible. Boring. We do the same thing every day. But… at least we got outdoors time.,3,9,39
Martin," Two hours, every day. Sometimes we’d play pickup football games… ",3,9,39

Martin," Actually, our TV was bigger than that one.   				",3,9,39

Robert,"  You see, I sit across from a man. I see his face. I see his eyes. Now, does it matter if he wants a hundred dollars of paper or a hundred million dollars of deep-sea drilling equipment? Don’t be a fool. He wants respect. He wants love. He wants to be younger. He wants to be attractive. There is no such thing as a product. Don’t ever think there is. There is only… sex.

Robert,  Do I look like someone who would waste my own time?,7,24,129
Robert,"  Will you be heard? Will you have a voice? Will I steamroll over you? Do you feel heard right now, Jim? Do you have a voice, right now? You can answer me.",7,24,129
Robert,"  That was your choice, not mine. The fallacy is that it is up to the steamroller. It is up to the object… whether it will be flattened or not, and I can tell from the small interaction we’ve had already, you won’t be flattened by anybody. Do you agree with me, Jim?",7,24,129
Robert,"  [more emphatically than Jim] Yes. You do. [nods at the Search Committee, then looks over at the camera with a smirk on his face]   				",7,24,129

Robert,"   I know you now, your nature. I’m done. Not worth continuing. [at the same time, Dwight says:",7,24,129
Robert,  I saw an episode of how they make paper on Sesame Street. [nods at Dwight mockingly],7,24,129
Robert,"  [chuckles] I will get offered the job. That’s a… call I’ve received many times. The slight hopefulness in their voice, the pregnant pause… while they wait to hear my response, and then… my response.  				",7,24,129

Packer, You didn’t order a stripper?  Have you ever even been to a bachelor party?,3,14,44
